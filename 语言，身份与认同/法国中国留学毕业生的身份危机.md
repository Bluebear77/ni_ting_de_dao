## The identity crisis of Chinese graduates in France

Abstract: This paper focuses on the mutation of personal identity in the migra-
tion process in order to understand the international mobility experience
of todayâ€™s Chinese students. Considering the myth of self-starters and the ideals
of success that are at the origin of the mobility project of young Chinese, the
new social conditions that they face in the new country to which they migrate
to, in this case, France, often render their project ineffective, causing an identity
crisis. This chapter analyzes the causes, the forms of expression and their
attempts at resolving the identity crises through a study on the biographies
of Chinese graduates working in France after their university training.
