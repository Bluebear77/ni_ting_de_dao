## Chapter One: The Power of Being Seen
## 第一节：被看见的能力

If you ever saw the and old emotional movie Fiddler Jewishon families the Roof, you know how warm and emotional Jewish families can be.
<br/>如果你曾看过那部关于犹太家庭的老电影《屋顶上的提琴手》，你就会知道犹太家庭是多么的温暖和充满情感。


They are always hugging, singing, dancing, laughing, and crying together.<br/>
他们总是在一起拥抱着，歌唱着，舞蹈着，大笑着，和哭泣着。

I come from the other kind ofev Jewish family.<br/>
我来自于另一种犹太家庭。

The culture of my upbringing could be summed up by the phrase “Think Yiddish, act British.” We were reserved, stiff-upper-lip types. I’m not saying I had a bad childhood— far from it. Home was a stimulating place for me, growing up. Over our Thanksgiving dinner tables, we talked about the history of Victorian funerary monuments and the evolutionary sources of lactose intolerance (I’m not kidding). There was love in the home. We just didn’t express it.<br>
我成长的文化可以用一句话概括：“像犹太人一样思考，像英伦人一样行动。” 我们是那种含蓄，内敛的类型（_译者：直译为“硬上唇”指不轻易表露情感_）的类型。我并不是说我有一个糟糕的童年——远非如此。对我而言，家一直是一个激发灵感的地方，在我的成长过程中。在我们的感恩节晚餐桌上，我们会讨论维多利亚时代墓碑的历史和乳糖不耐受的进化来源（我没开玩笑）。家里是有爱的。我们只是不表达它。

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I became a bit detached. When I was four, my nursery school teacher apparently told my parents, “David doesn’t always play with the other children. A lot of the time he stands off to the side and observes them.” Whether it was nature or nurture, a certain aloofness became part of my personality. By high school I had taken up long-term residency inside my own head. I felt most alive when I was engaged in the solitary business of writing. Junior year I wanted to date a woman named Bernice. But after doing some intel gathering, I discovered she wanted to go out with another guy. I was shocked. I remember telling myself, “What is she thinking? I write way better than that guy!” It’s quite possible that I had a somewhat constrained view of how social life worked for most people.<br/>
也许不足为奇，我变得有些疏离了。我四岁的时候，我的幼儿园老师显然告诉我的父母：“大卫不总是和其他孩子一起玩。很多时候他站在一边观察他们。”不管是先天天性还是后天教养，某种淡漠感成了我的性格的一部分。到了高中，我已经长期居住在自己的头脑中。当我从事写作这一孤独的事务时，我感觉最有活力。大三那年，我想约会一个叫贝尼斯的女生。但在做了一些情报收集后，我发现她想和另一个男孩出去。我震惊了。我记得告诉自己：“她在想什么？我写作比那个家伙好太多了！”很可能，我对大多数人的社交生活运作方式有着某种限制性的看法

Then, when I was eighteen, the admissions officers at Columbia, Wesleyan, and Brown decided I should go to the University of Chicago. I love my alma mater, and it has changed a lot for the better since I was there, but back then it wasn’t exactly the sort of get-in-touch-with-your- feelings place that would help thaw my emotional ice age.<br/>
后来，当我十八岁时，哥伦比亚大学、卫斯理大学和布朗大学的招生官决定我应该去芝加哥大学。我爱我的母校，自从我在那里以来，它已经有了很大的改善，但在当时，它并不完全是那种能帮助我化解情感冰河期的、让你接触自己感受的地方。

My favorite saying about Chicago is this one: It’s a Baptist school where atheist professors teach Jewish students Saint Thomas Aquinas. The students there still wear T-shirts that read, “Sure it works in practice, but does it work in theory?” And so into this heady world I traipsed and...shocker, I fit right in.<br/>
我最喜欢关于芝加哥的一句话是这样的：这是一所让无神论教授教授犹太学生圣托马斯·阿奎那的浸礼会学校。那里的学生仍然穿着印有“当然它在实践中行得通，但理论上行得通吗？”的T恤。就这样，我踏入了这个令人陶醉的世界，并且……令人震惊的，我完全融入了。

If you had met me ten years out of college, I think you would have found me a pleasant enough guy, cheerful but a tad inhibited—not somebody who was easy to get to know or who found it easy to get to know you. In truth, I was a practiced escape artist. When other people revealed some vulnerable intimacy to me, I was good at making meaningful eye contact with their shoes and then excusing myself to keep a vitally important appointment with my dry cleaner. I had a sense that this wasn’t an ideal way of being. I felt painfully awkward during those moments when someone tried to connect with me. I inwardly wanted to connect. I just didn’t know what to say.<br/>
如果你在我大学毕业十年后遇到了我，我想你会发现我是一个足够愉悦的人，乐观但有点拘谨——不是那种容易了解或觉得容易与人亲近的人。事实上，我是一位经验丰富的逃避艺术家。当其他人向我展示一些脆弱的亲密时，我擅长与他们的鞋子进行有意义的眼神交流，然后借口自己有个极其重要的干洗店预约而离开。我意识到这不是一种理想的存在方式。在有人试图与我建立联系的那些时刻，我感到异常尴尬。我内在想要建立联系。我只是不知道该说什么。

Repressing my own feelings became my default mode for moving through the world. I suppose I was driven by the usual causes: fear of intimacy; an intuition that if I really let my feelings flow, I wouldn’t like what bubbled up; a fear of vulnerability; and a general social ineptitude. One seemingly small and stupid episode symbolizes this repressed way of living for me. I’m a big baseball fan, and though I have been to hundreds of games, I have never once caught a foul ball in the stands. One day about fifteen years ago, I was at a game in Baltimore when a hitter’s bat shattered, and the whole bat except the knob helicoptered over the dugout and landed at my feet. I reached down and grabbed it. Getting a bat at a game is a thousand times better than getting a ball! I should have been jumping up and down, waving my trophy in the air, high-fiving the people around me, becoming a temporary jumbotron celebrity. Instead, I just placed the bat at my feet and sat, still-faced, as everyone stared at me. Looking back, I want to scream at myself: “Show a little joy!” But when it came to spontaneous displays of emotion, I had the emotional capacity of a head of cabbage.<br/>
抑制自己的感情成为了我在世界中前行的默认模式。我想我是被常见的原因所驱动：对亲密的恐惧；一个直觉，如果我真的让我的感情流淌，我可能不会喜欢涌现出来的东西；对脆弱的恐惧；以及一般的社交笨拙。有一个看似小而愚蠢的事件，对我来说象征着这种抑制的生活方式。我是个大棒球迷，尽管我去过数百场比赛，但我从未在看台上抓到过一个界外球。大约十五年前的一天，我在巴尔的摩观看一场比赛时，一名击球手的球棒碎裂了，除了旋钮之外，整个球棒都飞到了休息室上空，落在了我的脚下。我弯下腰抓住了它。在比赛中得到一个球棒比得到一个球好上千倍！我本应该跳起来，高举我的战利品，与周围的人击掌庆祝，成为暂时的巨型屏幕上的明星。相反，我只是把球棒放在脚边坐着，面无表情地坐着，所有人都盯着我看。回顾过去，我想对自己大喊：“展示一点喜悦吧！”但当涉及到情感的自发展示时，我有着一个卷心菜头的情感容量。

Life has a way of tenderizing you, though. Becoming a father was an emotional revolution, of course. Later, I absorbed my share of the blows that any adult suffers: broken relationships, public failures, the vulnerability that comes with getting older. The ensuing sense of my own frailty was good for me, introducing me to deeper, repressed parts of myself.<br/>
然而，生活总有办法让你变得柔软。当然，成为一名父亲是一场情感革命。后来，我也承受了任何成年人都会遭受的打击：破碎的关系，公开的失败，随着愈发衰老伴随而来的脆弱性。随之而来的对我自己脆弱性的感知对我是有益的，让我认识到了更深层、被压抑的那部分自我。

Another seemingly small event symbolizes the beginning of my ongoing journey toward becoming a full human being. As a commentator and pundit, I sometimes get asked to sit on panel discussions. Usually, they are at Washington think tanks and they have exactly as much emotional ardor as you’d expect from a discussion of fiscal policy. (As the journalist Meg Greenfield once observed, Washington isn’t filled with the wild kids who stuck the cat in the dryer; it’s filled with the kind of kids who tattled on the kids who stuck the cat in the dryer.) But on this particular day, I was invited to appear on a panel at the Public Theater in New York, the company that would later launch the musical Hamilton. I think we were supposed to talk about the role of the arts in public life. The actress Anne Hathaway was on the panel with me, along with a hilarious and highbrow clown named Bill Irwin and a few others. At this panel, D.C.think-tank rules didn’t apply. Backstage, before the panel, everybody was cheering each other on. We gathered for a big group hug. We charged out into the theater filled with camaraderie and purpose. Hathaway sang a moving song. There were tissues on the stage in case anybody started crying. The other panelists started emoting things. They talked about magical moments when they were undone, transported, or transformed by some artwork or play. Even I started emoting things! As my hero Samuel Johnson might have said, it was like watching a walrus trying to figure skate—it wasn’t good, but you were impressed that you were seeing it at all. Then, after the panel, we celebrated with another group hug. I thought, “This is fantastic! I’ve got to be around theater people more!” I vowed to alter my life.<br/>
另一个看似微不足道的事件象征着我成为一个完整人类存有旅程的开始。作为一名评论员和专家，我有时会被邀请参加小组讨论。通常，这些讨论会在华盛顿的智库举行，它们所表现出的情感热度正如你对讨论财政政策所期待的那样。（正如记者梅格·格林菲尔德Meg Greenfield曾经观察到的，华盛顿不是充满了那些把猫塞进干衣机的调皮孩子；而是充满了那些告发把猫塞进干衣机的孩子的那种孩子。）但在那一天，我被邀请到纽约的公共剧院参加一个小组讨论，这个剧院后来推出了音乐剧《汉密尔顿》。我想我们应该是讨论艺术在公共生活中的角色。与我一同参加小组讨论的有女演员安妮·海瑟薇，以及一个名叫比尔·欧文的风趣且高雅的小丑，还有其他几位演员。在这个小组讨论中，华盛顿智库的规则不适用。在小组讨论开始前的后台，每个人都在为彼此加油。我们聚在一起大团圆拥抱。我们带着友谊和目标冲进了剧院。海瑟薇唱了一首感人的歌。舞台上放着纸巾，以防有人开始哭泣。其他小组成员开始表达情感。他们谈论了那些被某些艺术作品或剧目完全开解、转移或转变的神奇时刻。连我也开始表达情感了！正如我的英雄塞缪尔·约翰逊可能会说的，这就像看着海象试图滑冰——虽然不好看，但你会对自己竟能见到这一幕而印象深刻。然后，在小组讨论后，我们又以另一个大团圆拥抱庆祝。我想，“这太棒了！我得多和剧院里的人在一起！”我发誓要改变我的生活。

Yes, I’m the guy who had his life changed by a panel discussion.<br/>

Okay, it was a little more gradual than that. But over the years I came to realize that living in a detached way is, in fact, a withdrawal from life, an estrangement not just from other people but from yourself. So I struck out on a journey.<br/>

We writers work out our stuff in public, of course, so I wrote books on emotion, moral character, and spiritual growth. And it kind of worked. Over the years, I altered my life. I made myself more vulnerable with people and more emotionally expressive in public. I tried to become the sort of person people would confide in—talk with me about their divorces, their grief over the death of their spouse, worries about their kids. Gradually, things began to change inside. I had these novel experiences: “What are these tinglings in my chest? Oh, they’re feelings!” One day, I’m dancing at a concert: “Feelings are great!” Another day, I’m sad that my wife is away on a trip: “Feelings suck!” My life goals changed, too. When I was young, I wanted to be knowledgeable, but as I got older, I wanted to be wise. Wise people don’t just possess information; they possess a compassionate understanding of other people. They know about life.<br/>

I’m not an exceptional person, but I am a grower. I do have the ability to look at my shortcomings, then try to prod myself into becoming a more fully developed human being. I’ve made progress over these years. Wait, I can prove this to you! Twice in my life I’ve been lucky enough to have appeared on Oprah’s show Super Soul Sunday, once in 2015 and once in 2019. After we were done taping the second interview, Oprah came up to me and said, “I’ve rarely seen someone change so much. You were so blocked before.” That was a proud moment for me. I mean, she should know—she’s Oprah.<br/>

I learned something profound along the way. Being open-hearted is a prerequisite for being a full, kind, and wise human being. But it is not enough. People need social skills. We talk about the importance of “relationships,” “community,” “friendship,” “social connection,” but these words are too abstract. The real act of, say, building a friendship or creating a community involves performing a series of small, concrete social actions well: disagreeing without poisoning the relationship; revealing vulnerability at the appropriate pace; being a good listener; knowing how to end a conversation gracefully; knowing how to ask for and offer forgiveness; knowing how to let someone down without breaking their heart; knowing how to sit with someone who is suffering; knowing how to host a gathering where everyone feels embraced; knowing how to see things from another’s point of view.<br/>

These are some of the most important skills a human being can possess, and yet we don’t teach them in school.<br/>

Some days it seems like we have intentionally built a society that gives people little guidance on how to perform the most important activities of life. As a result, a lot of us are lonely and lack deep friendships. It’s not because we don’t want these things. Above almost any other need, human beings long to have another person look into their face with loving respect and acceptance. It’s that we lack practical knowledge about how to give each other the kind of rich attention we desire. I’m not sure Western societies were ever great at teaching these skills, but over the past several decades, in particular, there’s been a loss of moral knowledge. Our schools and other institutions have focused more and more on preparing people for their careers, but not on the skills of being considerate toward the person next to you. The humanities, which teach us what goes on in the minds of other people, have become marginalized.<br/>

And a life spent on social media is not exactly helping people learn these skills. On social media you can have the illusion of social contact without having to perform the gestures that actually build trust, care, and affection. On social media, stimulation replaces intimacy. There is judgment everywhere and understanding nowhere.<br/>

In this age of creeping dehumanization, I’ve become obsessed with social skills: how to get better at treating people with consideration; how to get better at understanding the people right around us. I’ve come to believe that the quality of our lives and the health of our society depends, to a large degree, on how well we treat each other in the minute interactions of daily life.

And all these different skills rest on one foundational skill: the ability to understand what another person is going through. There is one skill that lies at the heart of any healthy person, family, school, community organization, or society: the ability to see someone else deeply and make them feel seen—to accurately know another person, to let them feel valued, heard, and understood.<br/>

That is at the heart of being a good person, the ultimate gift you can give to others and to yourself.<br/>

— Human beings need recognition as much as they need food and water. No crueler punishment can be devised than to not see someone, to render them unimportant or invisible.<br/>

“The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them,” George Bernard Shaw wrote, “but to be indifferent to them: that’s the essence of inhumanity.” To do that is to say: You don’t matter. You don’t exist.<br/>

On the other hand, there are few things as fulfilling as that sense of being seen and understood. I often ask people to tell me about times they’ve felt seen, and with glowing eyes they tell me stories about pivotal moments in their life.<br/>

They talk about a time when someone perceived some talent in them that they themselves weren’t even able to see. They talk about a time when somebody understood exactly what they needed at some exhausted moment—and stepped in, in just the right way, to lighten the load.<br/>

Over the past four years I’ve become determined to learn the skills that go into seeing others, understandings others, making other people feel respected, valued, and safe. First, I’ve wanted to understand and learn these skills for pragmatic reasons. You can’t make the big decisions in life well unless you’re able to understand others. If you are going to marry someone, you have to know not just about that person’s looks, interests, and career prospects but how the pains of their childhood show up in their adulthood, whether their deepest longings align with your own. If you’re going to hire someone, you have to be able to see not just the qualities listed on their résumé but the subjective parts of their consciousness, the parts that make some people try hard or feel comfortable with uncertainty, calm in a crisis, or generous to colleagues. If you’re going to retain someone in your company, you have to know how to make them feel appreciated. In a 2021 study, McKinsey asked managers why their employees were quitting their firms. Most of the managers believed that people were leaving to get more pay. But when the McKinsey researchers asked the employees themselves why they’d left, the top reasons were relational. They didn’t feel recognized and valued by their managers and organizations. They didn’t feel seen.<br/>

And if this ability to truly see others is important in making the marriage decision or in hiring and retaining workers, it is also important if you are a teacher leading students, a doctor examining patients, a host anticipating the needs of a guest, a friend spending time with a friend, a parent raising a child, a spouse watching the one you love crawl into bed at the end of the day. Life goes a lot better if you can see things from other people’s points of view, as well as your own. “Artificial intelligence is going to do many things for us in the decades ahead, and replace humans at many tasks, but one thing it will never be able to do is to create person-to-person connections. If you want to thrive in the age of AI, you better become exceptionally good at connecting with others.” Second, I wanted to learn this skill for what I think of as spiritual reasons. Seeing someone well is a powerfully creative act. No one can fully appreciate their own beauty and strengths unless those things are mirrored back to them in the mind of another. There is something in being seen that brings forth growth. If you beam the light of your attention on me, I blossom. If you see great potential in me, I will probably come to see great potential in myself. If you can understand my frailties and sympathize with me when life treats me harshly, then I am more likely to have the strength to weather the storms of life. “The roots of resilience,” the psychologist Diana Fosha writes, “are to be found in the sense of being understood by and existing in the mind and heart of a loving, attuned, and self-possessed other.” In how you see me, I will learn to see myself.<br/>

And third, I wanted to learn this skill for what I guess you’d call reasons of national survival. Human beings evolved to live in small bands with people more or less like themselves. But today, many of us live in wonderfully pluralistic societies. In America, Europe, India, and many other places, we’re trying to build mass multicultural democracies, societies that contain people from diverse races and ethnicities, with different ideologies and backgrounds. To survive, pluralistic societies require citizens who can look across difference and show the kind of understanding that is a prerequisite of trust—who can say, at the very least, “I’m beginning to see you. Certainly, I will never fully experience the world as you experience it, but I’m beginning, a bit, to see the world through your eyes.” Our social skills are currently inadequate to the pluralistic societies we are living in. In my job as a journalist, I often find myself interviewing people who tell me they feel invisible and disrespected: Black people feeling that the systemic inequities that afflict their daily experiences are not understood by whites, rural people feeling they are not seen by coastal elites, people across political divides staring at each other with angry incomprehension, depressed young people feeling misunderstood by their parents and everyone else, privileged people blithely unaware of all the people around them cleaning their houses and serving their needs, husbands and wives in broken marriages who realize that the person who should know them best actually has no clue. Many of our big national problems arise from the fraying of our social fabric. If we want to begin repairing the big national ruptures, we have to learn to do the small things well.<br/>

— In every crowd there are Diminishers and there are Illuminators. Diminishers make people feel small and unseen. They see other people as things to be used, not as persons to be befriended. They stereotype and ignore. They are so involved with themselves that other people are just not on their radar screen.<br/>

Illuminators, on the other hand, have a persistent curiosity about other people. They have been trained or have trained themselves in the craft of understanding others. They know what to look for and how to ask the right questions at the right time. They shine the brightness of their care on people and make them feel bigger, deeper, respected, lit up.<br/>

I’m sure you’ve experienced a version of this: You meet somebody who seems wholly interested in you, who gets you, who helps you name and see things in yourself that maybe you hadn’t even yet put into words, and you become a better version of yourself.<br/>

A biographer of the novelist E. M. Forster wrote, “To speak to him was to be seduced by an inverse charisma, a sense of being listened to with such intensity that you had to be your most honest, sharpest, and best self.” Imagine how good it would be to be that guy.<br/>

Perhaps you know the story that is sometimes told of Jennie Jerome, who later became Winston Churchill’s mother. It’s said that when she was young, she dined with the British statesman William Gladstone and left thinking he was the cleverest person in England. Later she dined with Gladstone’s great rival, Benjamin Disraeli, and left that dinner thinking she was the cleverest person in England. It’s nice to be like Gladstone, but it’s better to be like Disraeli.<br/>

Or consider a story from Bell Labs. Many years ago, executives there realized that some of their researchers were far more productive, and amassed many more patents, than the others. Why was this? they wondered.<br/>

They wanted to know what made these researchers so special. They explored every possible explanation— educational background, position in the company—but came up empty. Then they noticed a quirk. The most productive researchers were in the habit of having breakfast or lunch with an electrical engineer named Harry Nyquist. Aside from making important contributions to communications theory, Nyquist, the scientists said, really listened to their challenges, got inside their heads, asked good questions, and brought out the best in them. In other words, Nyquist was an Illuminator.<br/>

So what are you most of the time, a Diminisher or an Illuminator? How good are you at reading other people? I probably don’t know you personally, but I can make the following statement with a high degree of confidence: You’re not as good as you think you are. We all go through our days awash in social ignorance. William Ickes, a leading scholar on how accurate people are at perceiving what other people are thinking, finds that strangers who are in the midst of their first conversation read each other accurately only about 20 percent of the time and close friends and family members do so only 35 percent of the time. Ickes rates his research subjects on a scale of “empathic accuracy” from 0 to 100 percent and finds great variation from person to person. Some people get a zero rating. When they are in conversation with someone they’ve just met, they have no clue what the other person is actually thinking. But other people are pretty good at reading others and score around 55 percent. (The problem is that people who are terrible at reading others think they are just as good as those who are pretty accurate.) Intriguingly, Ickes finds that the longer many couples are married, the less accurate they are at reading each other.<br/>

They lock in some early version of who their spouse is, and over the years, as the other person changes, that version stays fixed—and they know less and less about what’s actually going on in the other’s heart and mind.<br/>

You don’t have to rely on an academic study to know that this is true. How often in your life have you felt stereotyped and categorized? How often have you felt prejudged, invisible, misheard, or misunderstood? Do you really think you don’t do this to others on a daily basis? — The purpose of this book is to help us become more skilled at the art of seeing others and making them feel seen, heard, and understood. When I started research on this subject, I had no clue what this skill consisted of. But I did know that exceptional people in many fields had taught themselves versions of this skill. Psychologists are trained to see the defenses people build up to protect themselves from their deepest fears. Actors can identify the core traits of a character and teach themselves to inhabit the role.<br/>

Biographers can notice the contradictions in a person and yet see a life whole. Teachers can spot potential. Skilled talk show and podcast hosts know how to get people to open up and be their true selves. There are so many professions in which the job is to see, anticipate, and understand people: nursing, the ministry, management, social work, marketing, journalism, editing, HR, and on and on. My goal was to gather some of the knowledge that is dispersed across these professions and integrate it into a single practical approach.<br/>

So I embarked on a journey toward greater understanding, a journey on which I still have a long, long way to go. I gradually realized that trying to deeply know and understand others is not just about mastering some set of techniques; it’s a way of life. It’s like what actors who have gone to acting school experience: When they’re onstage, they’re not thinking about the techniques they learned in school. They’ve internalized them, so it is now just part of who they are. I’m hoping this book will help you adopt a different posture toward other people, a different way of being present with people, a different way of having bigger conversations. Living this way can yield the deepest pleasures.<br/>

One day, not long ago, I was reading a dull book at my dining room table when I looked up and saw my wife framed in the front doorway of our house. The door was open. The late afternoon light was streaming in around her.<br/>

Her mind was elsewhere, but her gaze was resting on a white orchid that we kept in a pot on a table by the door.<br/>

I paused, and looked at her with a special attention, and had a strange and wonderful awareness ripple across my mind: “I know her,” I thought. “I really know her, through and through.” If you had asked what it was exactly that I knew about her in that moment, I would have had trouble answering. It wasn’t any collection of facts about her, or her life story, or even something expressible in the words I’d use to describe her to a stranger. It was the whole flowing of her being— the incandescence of her smile, the undercurrent of her insecurities, the rare flashes of fierceness, the vibrancy of her spirit. It was the lifts and harmonies of her music.<br/>

I wasn’t seeing pieces of her or having specific memories. What I saw, or felt I saw, was the wholeness of her. How her consciousness creates her reality. It’s what happens when you’ve been with someone for a while, endured and delighted together, and slowly grown an intuitive sense for how that person feels and responds. It might even be accurate to say that for a magical moment I wasn’t seeing her, I was seeing out from her. Perhaps to really know another person, you have to have a glimmer of how they experience the world. To really know someone, you have to know how they know you.<br/>

The only word I can think of in the English language that captures my mental processes at that instant is “beholding.” She was at the door, the light blazing in behind her, and I was beholding her. They say there is no such thing as an ordinary person. When you’re beholding someone, you’re seeing the richness of this particular human consciousness, the full symphony—how they perceive and create their life.<br/>

I don’t have to tell you how delicious that moment felt— warm, intimate, profound. It was the bliss of human connection. “A lot of brilliant writers and thinkers don’t have any sense for how people operate,” the therapist and author Mary Pipher once told me. “To be able to understand people and be present for them in their experience—that’s the most important thing in the world.”
