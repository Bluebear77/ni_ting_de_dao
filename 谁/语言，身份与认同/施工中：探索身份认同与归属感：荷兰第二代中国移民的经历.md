# Abstract
# 摘要

This study focuses on the experiences of second-generation Chinese immigrants in the Netherlands as
they navigate their identity and belonging in Dutch society. As a case study, the Covid-19 pandemic is
assessed, where second-generation individuals were faced with increased discrimination. The study
explores the impact of parenting behavior, particularly the phenomenon of ‘’tiger parenting’’, which
emphasizes academic excellence and success but does not always promote integration into Dutch
society. ‘’Othering’’ is introduced to describe the treatment of individuals with immigrant backgrounds
as different, resulting in challenges to their sense of belonging. The study highlights the vulnerability
of the Chinese community to stereotypes, including the ‘’model minority’’ stereotype, which
participants often embraced by striving for societal contributions while avoiding conflicts.

本研究聚焦于第二代中国移民在荷兰的经历，探讨他们如何在荷兰社会中导航自己的身份和归属感。作为一个案例研究，评估了Covid-19大流行期间第二代个体面临的增加的歧视。研究探讨了育儿行为的影响，特别是强调学术优秀和成功但不总是促进融入荷兰社会的“虎妈”现象。“他者化”被用来描述将有移民背景的个体视为不同的对待，这导致他们的归属感受到挑战。研究强调了中国社区对刻板印象的脆弱性，包括“模范少数族裔”刻板印象，参与者常通过努力为社会做出贡献同时避免冲突而接受这一刻板印象。


Five distinct identities emerge from the findings: Dutch identity, hybrid identity, Chinese identity, non-
nation identity, and ascribed identity. Feelings of belonging play a crucial role in identity formation,
with participants primarily feeling connected to the host society. Acceptance or non-acceptance from
the host society significantly influences their sense of belonging. The study also delves into
participants' future aspirations, highlighting their desire to provide their children with a different
upbringing that avoids feelings of difference and promotes integration. Despite varying priorities, this
desire resonates with the philosophy of the first-generation.

研究结果中出现五种独特的身份：荷兰身份、混合身份、中国身份、非国民身份和外加身份。归属感在身份形成中扮演关键角色，参与者主要感到与东道国社会的联系。东道国社会的接受或不接受显著影响他们的归属感。研究还深入探讨了参与者的未来愿望，强调他们希望为自己的孩子提供一种不同的养育方式，避免感受到差异并促进融入。尽管优先级各不相同，这种愿望与第一代的哲学相呼应。

While participants expressed empathy for the #StopAsianHate protest during the Covid-19 pandemic,
they took limited practical action due to a lack of increased ‘’othering’’ and other discriminatory
behavior towards them. Living up to the model minority stereotype, participants prefer to avoid
conflict and remain in the background. The research underscores the enduring importance of identity
and belonging and their relevance to immigrant groups. Understanding these dynamics is vital for
fostering an inclusive society.

尽管参与者对Covid-19大流行期间的#StopAsianHate抗议表示同情，但由于未增加的“他者化”和其他歧视行为，他们采取了有限的实际行动。符合模范少数族裔刻板印象，参与者倾向于避免冲突并留在幕后。研究强调了身份和归属感的持久重要性及其对移民群体的相关性。理解这些动态对于培养包容性社会至关重要。

## 1. Introduction
## 1. 引言

### 1.1 Problem statement
### 1.1 问题陈述

Throughout time, Chinese immigrants in Western countries have been commonly stereotyped as
‘’quiet, non-confrontational and respectful of authority’’ (Jess, 2017). However, stereotyping towards
Chinese immigrants have also taken up more extreme, xenophobic forms. For example, Caldwell
(1971) describes how Chinese immigrants in California, United States of America, turned from heroic
labor migrants at their first arrival to a minority group scapegoat. In recent times, discrimination
towards Chinese can still be observed, such as during the Covid- 19 pandemic. As the Covid-19 virus
was first detected in 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus was promptly referred to as the ‘’Wuhan virus’’,
‘’China virus’’ or ‘’Chinese virus’’ (Su et al., 2020). This discourse resulted in increased discrimination
towards people of Chinese, and often Asian descent (Bhanot et al., 2021; Devakumar et al., 2020).
However, this was responded to by the Asian community through protests in different Western
countries led under the social media term #StopAsianHate. Young people with Asian heritage took part
in these protests and made their voices heard. Based on this, it seems that the aforementioned
stereotypes of Chinese immigrants as ‘’quiet’’ and ‘’non-confrontational’’ does not completely apply
to the younger part of this immigrant group, and a more vocal and activist attitude has come to the
surface. In this thesis, I aim to explore how second-generation Chinese in the Netherlands find their
sense of belonging and shape their own identity within the Dutch society, where they for example
experience increased discrimination during the Covid-19 pandemic.

长期以来，西方国家的中国移民常被刻板地描述为“安静、非对抗性、尊重权威”（Jess, 2017）。然而，针对中国移民的刻板印象也表现出更极端、排外的形式。例如，Caldwell（1971）描述了如何中国移民在美国加州，最初作为英雄般的劳工移民抵达，后来变成了少数群体的替罪羊。近期，例如在Covid-19大流行期间，仍然可以观察到针对中国人的歧视。由于Covid-19病毒最初于2019年在中国武汉被发现，该病毒很快被称为“武汉病毒”、“中国病毒”或“中国病毒”（Su等人，2020）。这种言论导致了对中国人和往往是亚裔后裔的歧视加剧（Bhanot等人，2021；Devakumar等人，2020）。然而，亚洲社区通过在不同西方国家举行的抗议活动做出了回应，这些抗议活动在社交媒体上以#StopAsianHate为标签。有亚洲血统的年轻人参加了这些抗议活动，并发出了他们的声音。基于此，看来上述关于中国移民“安静”和“非对抗性”的刻板印象并不完全适用于这一移民群体的年轻部分，一种更加直言不讳和积极主动的态度已经浮现出来。在本论文中，我旨在探索荷兰的第二代中国人如何在荷兰社会中找到归属感并塑造自己的身份，例如在Covid-19大流行期间经历增加的歧视。

Recent initiatives such as Asian Raisins, Stop AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) Hate and the Dutch
documentary Hanky Panky Goodbye are examples of how people of Asian descent make this social
issue known to the public. In a 2020 report about ‘’perceived discrimination in the Netherlands’’ from
the Social and Cultural planning office, a Dutch governmental institution, people with Chinese or Asian
heritage were not included in the statistics (Andriessen et al., 2020), thereby not addressing this as a
social issue. However, the publicly funded institute _Kennisplatform Integratie en Samenleven_
(Knowledge Platform Integration and Living Together) does acknowledge increased discrimination
towards people with Asian heritage since the Covid-19 pandemic and researched this phenomenon
during the pandemic (2021). At the same time, the second-generation Chinese Dutch is labeled as the
‘’model minority’’ stereotype, where they are described as ‘’not complaining, not creating any fuss and
hard working’’ (Roosendaal, 2004, as cited in Chow et al., 2008).

最近的一些倡议，如Asian Raisins、Stop AAPI（亚美太平洋岛民）Hate和荷兰纪录片Hanky Panky Goodbye等，都是亚裔后裔向公众展示这一社会问题的例子。在荷兰社会文化规划办公室（一家荷兰政府机构）2020年关于“荷兰感知歧视”的报告中，中国或亚裔后裔并未被纳入统计数据中（Andriessen等人，2020），因此没有将其视为一个社会问题。然而，公共资助的机构_Kennisplatform Integratie en Samenleven_（整合与共同生活知识平台）确实承认自Covid-19大流行以来，对亚裔后裔的歧视有所增加，并在大流行期间研究了这一现象（2021年）。与此同时，第二代华裔荷兰人被贴上了“模范少数族裔”的刻板印象，他们被描述为“不抱怨、不制造麻烦、勤奋工作”（Roosendaal，2004年，引自Chow等人，2008年）。

the Netherlands, forming what is known as the ‘’second-generation’’ within migration studies. According to de Haas et al. (2019, p. 284), the second-generation refers to ‘’native-born persons with both parents foreign-born’’. Growing up in a multicultural environment, the second-generation is often bilingual due to exposure to both the host society’s culture and their home culture. This multifaceted upbringing of the second-generation can lead to complex forms of identity expression, construction and formation (Somerville, 2008). As the second-generation is still often associated as immigrants, this can trigger intricacy on their sense of belonging and identity shaping. As Hou et al. (2018) already argued, exclusion and experienced discrimination among immigrants leads to lower sense of belonging to the host country.

荷兰形成了所谓的“第二代”移民群体。根据de Haas等人的研究（2019年，第284页），第二代指的是“出生在当地，父母均为外国出生的人”。这些在多元文化环境中成长的第二代通常具有双语能力，这是由于他们同时接触到东道国的文化和自己的家庭文化。这种多方面的成长经历可能导致第二代在身份表达、构建和形成上表现出复杂性（Somerville, 2008）。由于第二代通常仍被视为移民，这可能触发他们在归属感和身份塑造上的复杂感受。正如Hou等人（2018）已经论述的，移民中的排斥感和经历的歧视会导致他们对东道国的归属感降低。

This study focuses on the second-generation of Chinese immigrants in the Netherlands. The choice of
the Chinese community is due to the fact that they often are confronted with stereotypes. Secondly, I
am from Chinese descent myself and I wish to explore how other second-generation Chinese Dutch
shape their identity and find their sense of belonging within Dutch society. Moreover, since the
migration of the first generation to the Netherlands is relatively recent, the second-generation can
clearly be segregated from the first. Although the first Chinese immigrants arrived in the early 20th
century (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2011), the majority migrated between 1970 and 1980
(Chinees Cultuurplein, 2022). This is in contrast to immigrants with post-colonial relations with the
Netherlands or Non-Western labor immigrants who settled in the Netherlands shortly after World War
II, in the 1950s (Prins, 1996). Learning the language of the host society has a close relationship with
the socio-economic integration of immigrant groups (Zorlu & Hartog, 2018). The difference between
the Chinese and Dutch language may present an obstacle for Chinese immigrants to become proficient
in Dutch, which, in turn, could potentially affect the acculturation of the second-generation. This
parental milieu, which is often in contrast to the Dutch culture, presents a unique and challenging
setting for the second-generation to find their belonging and identity.

本研究聚焦于荷兰的中国第二代移民。选择研究中国社区是因为他们经常面临刻板印象的挑战。其次，我本人也是中国血统，希望探索其他荷兰华裔第二代如何塑造自己的身份并在荷兰社会中寻找归属感。此外，由于第一代移民到荷兰相对较近，第二代与第一代有明显的区分。虽然最早的中国移民在20世纪初抵达荷兰（Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2011），但大部分移民是在1970年到1980年之间迁移到荷兰的（Chinees Cultuurplein, 2022）。这与那些在第二次世界大战后不久，即1950年代定居荷兰的后殖民关系移民或非西方劳工移民形成对比（Prins, 1996）。学习东道国语言与移民群体的社会经济一体化密切相关（Zorlu & Hartog, 2018）。中文与荷兰文的差异可能是中国移民精通荷兰文的障碍，这反过来可能潜在影响第二代的文化适应。这种家庭环境常常与荷兰文化形成对比，为第二代寻找归属感和身份提供了一个独特且充满挑战的环境。

Gover et al. (2020) calls the phenomenon where immigrants are not completely accepted in a receiving
society as ‘’othering’’ and observed the increase of this during the Covid-19 pandemic. A relevant
question to ask is to what extent the second-generation has been subjected to this and how it changes
their self-identification and belonging. Self-exclusion, which entails a deliberate choice to detach
oneself from a group because there is a low sense of belonging, can be a result of this ‘’othering’’. This
can also happen when there is a higher sentiment towards the home culture than to the host culture.
Certainly, using the two #StopAsianHate protests, organized in Amsterdam in March and April, 2019,
as a case study provides a valuable focal point for understanding the experiences of the second-
generation Chinese immigrants. Analyzing the dominant presence of second-generation individuals at

Gover等人（2020）将移民在接受社会中未完全被接受的现象称为“他者化”，并观察到在Covid-19大流行期间此现象有所增加。一个相关的问题是，第二代在多大程度上受到这种现象的影响，以及这如何改变他们的自我认同和归属感。自我排斥，即由于归属感低而故意选择与某个群体脱离关系，可能是“他者化”的结果。当对家乡文化的情感超过对东道文化的情感时，也可能发生这种情况。显然，使用2019年3月和4月在阿姆斯特丹组织的两次#StopAsianHate抗议活动作为案例研究，为理解第二代中国移民的经历提供了一个宝贵的焦点。分析第二代个体在这些抗议活动中的显著存在，可以提供洞察他们如何主张自己的身份并挑战被东道国社会及其自身社区强加的刻板印象。

these protests offers a unique lens through which to assess the impact of the pandemic on this specific
group. This approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of the challenges faced by second-
generation Chinese immigrants, shedding light on the effects of the pandemic on their sense of
identity, belonging, and societal integration. By organizing together, they raise awareness to the
problem and in such way claim their own space within society.

分析这些抗议活动中第二代人的主导地位，为评估大流行对这一特定群体的影响提供了独特的视角。这种方法允许全面探索第二代华裔移民所面临的挑战，揭示了大流行对他们的身份感、归属感和社会融合感的影响。通过组织在一起，他们提高了对问题的认识，并以这种方式在社会中为自己争取空间。

The concept of identity is widely covered in psychology literature and there is still active debate on its
definition. In the most clear and concise way, identity answers the question of ‘’who am I?’’, ‘’who are
we?’’ or ‘’who are you?’’ (Schwartz et al., 2011; Weigert, 1986). As such, the concept of identity is
about definitions, characteristics and meanings that one gives to itself, but also how one is perceived
by others. Identity can be seen as something personal, but is also how people associate themselves
with other groups such as, ethnicity, religion, language, sports, occupation and etcetera. As Verkuyten
(2005, p. 12) describes identity, it ‘’is happening in a constantly changing global, national, and local
context, identity is an always unfinished project and temporary state’’. Therefore, identity can be
considered as dynamic and subject to change over time. Belonging, on the other hand, ‘’can enable us
to ask questions about belonging to ‘what’ rather than, as with identity, who an individual ‘is’ or who
and what they ‘identify with’’’ (Anthias, 2013). Also, as Korteweg (2017) describes it, a strong sense of
belonging ‘’is marked by a deeply felt right to be here (red. the host society)’’. Belonging is an essential aspect of identification and serves as a crucial guide in determining people’s sense of affiliation to where and what they feel they are part of. Differences between Eastern and Western cultures have been researched extensively on how this results in specific cognitive behavior (Imada et al., 2013;
Moriguchi et al., 2012; Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2004), thereby making it more significant to study a
group that has been exposed to norms from both cultures. Second-generation individuals can use this
exposure of both cultures to their advantage, but it can also be the cause of the conflict in their identity shaping and not knowing where to belong to.

身份的概念在心理学文献中有广泛的覆盖，关于其定义仍然存在活跃的讨论。以最清晰和简洁的方式，身份回答了“我是谁？”、“我们是谁？”或“你是谁？”的问题（Schwartz 等人，2011；Weigert，1986）。因此，身份概念关于一个人对自己的定义、特征和意义，但也涉及他人如何看待一个人。身份可以被视为个人的东西，但也是人们如何将自己与其他群体（如种族、宗教、语言、体育、职业等）联系起来。如 Verkuyten（2005，第12页）所描述，**身份“在不断变化的全球、国家和地方环境中发生，身份是一个永远未完成的项目和暂时状态”。** 因此，身份可以被认为是动态的，随时间变化。另一方面，归属感“可以让我们提出关于归属于‘什么’的问题，而不是像身份那样，个人‘是’什么或他们‘认同’什么”（Anthias，2013）。同样，正如 Korteweg（2017）所描述，**强烈的归属感“被深切地认为有权在这里（东道国）”。** **归属感是认同的基本方面，是确定人们对他们所属的地方和事物的归属感的关键指南。** 东西方文化之间的差异已经被广泛研究，这如何导致特定的认知行为（Imada 等人，2013；Moriguchi 等人，2012；Spencer-Rodgers 等人，2004），因此，研究一个同时接触到两种文化的群体变得更加重要。**第二代个体可以利用这种双重文化的接触为自己的优势，但这也可以是他们身份塑造冲突的原因，以及他们不知道自己属于哪里。**


### 1.2 Research objectives and research questions
### 1.2 研究目标和研究问题

The aim of this research is to explore how second-generation Chinese immigrants in the Netherlands
find their sense of belonging and identify themselves within Dutch society.

这项研究的目的是探索在荷兰的第二代华裔移民如何找到他们在荷兰社会中的归属感和认同感。

The diversity of migration studies is extensive, but is often focused on the impact that immigration has
on sending and receiving societies. However, this research is focused on individuals with a migrant
background and the role that external factors have on their internalization of identity. Identity is highly
personal but as people tend to identify themselves with specific groups, the possibility of group

移民研究的多样性很广泛，但通常集中于移民对发送国和接收国社会的影响。然而，这项研究专注于具有移民背景的个体以及外部因素对他们身份内化的影响。身份是高度个人化的，但当人们倾向于将自己与特定群体认同时，群体认同的可能性

identities such as ethnic minority groups, will also be considered. This importance is stressed by
Verkuyten (2005, p. 64), explaining that ‘’identification establishes the link between the individual and
the group. As soon as people identify with their group, that group becomes the basis for thinking,
feeling and acting.’’

作为少数族裔群体的身份认同,也将被考虑。Verkuyten (2005, p. 64) 强调了这一重要性，他解释说：“身份认同建立了个体与群体之间的联系。一旦人们与他们的群体产生认同，该群体就成为思考、感受和行动的依据。”

Second-generation immigrants are a much more specified and often less researched group compared
to the first-generation. Understanding how this specific group navigate themselves within society is of
importance because they are part of the society. Moreover, it is a group looking for integration into
society, to find their own belonging and oppose the current state of affairs, as seen in the organization
of recent protests against Asian racism, inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic. By protesting, this group
seeks further integration into society and as such, it is also a form of claiming their own space.
Protesting and speaking up are a manifestation of this generation’s dissatisfaction and therefore also
raises the question how they process their own self-identification. The way they identify themselves
in society can be a result of how society positions them. The objective is to put the individual at the
center and assess how self-identification and belonging is shaped. In order to do this, the following
main research question is formulated:

相较于第一代移民，第二代移民是一个更具体且往往研究较少的群体。理解这一特定群体如何在社会中导航自己是重要的，因为他们是社会的一部分。此外，这是一个寻求融入社会的群体，寻找自己的归属并反对当前的事态，如最近针对由 Covid-19 大流行引发的亚裔种族主义的抗议活动所见。通过抗议，这个群体寻求进一步融入社会，因此，这也是一种宣称自己空间的形式。抗议和发声是这一代人不满的表现，因此也引发了他们如何处理自我认同的问题。他们在社会中的自我认同可能是社会定位他们的结果。目标是将个体置于中心，并评估自我认同和归属感是如何形成的。为此，制定了以下主要研究问题：

### 1.3 Research question
### 1.3 研究问题

_How do second-generation Chinese immigrants in the Netherlands self-identify, organize and
navigate their belonging in Dutch society?_

_在荷兰的第二代华裔移民如何自我认同、组织和定位他们在荷兰社会中的归属？_

In this study, self-identification and belonging of the research group are placed at the core. Even
though identity is intangible, a person’s identification to a certain group or culture can lead to
behavioral change (Burke, 2006). In order to answer this question it is necessary to know what
important elements play a role in their identity shaping and if applicable, to what kind of behavioral
changes this leads. As argued by multiple scholars, identity can be fluid and the possibility that
immigrants can have dual identities has been explored by Verkuyten et al. (2019), or ‘’hybrid
identities’’ (Stepick et al., 2011) has been coined in order to describe the non-fixed identities
immigrants can have. These concepts seem applicable especially for second-generation immigrants,
since they are more exposed to the host culture compared to the first-generation (Tang & Merrilees,
2021).

在这项研究中，研究组的自我认同和归属感放在核心位置。**尽管身份是无形的，一个人对某个群体或文化的认同可以导致行为变化（Burke，2006）。** 为了回答这个问题，需要知道哪些重要元素在他们的身份形塑中起作用，如果适用的话，这将导致哪些类型的行为变化。正如多位学者所论证，身份可以是流动的，移民可能具有双重身份，Verkuyten 等人（2019）已经探讨了这一点，或者“混合身份”（Stepick 等人，2011）一词已被创造出来，用以描述移民可能具有的非固定身份。这些概念尤其适用于第二代移民，因为与第一代相比，他们更多地暴露于东道国的文化（Tang & Merrilees，2021）。

Certain factors can lead to the creation of self-identification, such as someone’s upbringing. As second-

towards Asian people since the Covid-19 pandemic can have major impacts on identification and is
used as a case study in order to explore the impact this has had on the research group. To answer the
main research question, the following sub questions have been formulated:

的歧视行为，自 Covid-19 大流行以来对亚洲人的歧视加剧，可能会对身份认同产生重大影响，并被用作案例研究，以探讨这对研究小组的影响。 为了回答主要研究问题，制定了以下子问题：

### 1.4 Sub questions

1. _In what ways do the host society and home culture play a role in belonging and identity_
    _shaping?_
   
   _东道主社会和家庭文化如何影响归属感和身份塑造？_
   
In this case, the Netherlands is the host society of the second-generation immigrants. Acculturation
into the host society’s culture is an important aspect of this. The aim of this question is to find out to what extent they identify, if at all, as Dutch. Growing up in the Netherlands would mean they received education in the Netherlands and have been exposed to Dutch culture from a young age. Assimilation and acculturation are concepts that concentrate on the degree of how immigrants adapt and
incorporate into the host society (Scholten et al., 2022, p. 11). These can prove to be valuable in order to detect elements and affiliations of Dutch identity in the research group.

在这个案例中，荷兰是第二代移民的东道主社会。融入东道主社会的文化是这个问题的一个重要方面。这个问题的目的是为了找出他们在多大程度上认同自己是荷兰人。在荷兰长大意味着他们在荷兰接受教育，并从小就接触到荷兰文化。同化和文化适应是关注移民如何适应和融入东道主社会的程度的概念（Scholten 等人，2022年，第11页）。这些可以帮助检测出研究组中荷兰身份的元素和隶属关系。

Gaining an understanding of the extent to which the research group identifies with their home culture
is crucial in order to comprehensively investigate the impact of both cultures in their upbringing. This
will form as a basic understanding of which variables contribute to the formation of their identity. For
example, Noels et al. (1996) have argued the necessity of language proficiency in order for immigrants
to assimilate to the host society, but proficiency of their mother tongue must also be taken into
account. Another example is the complex relationship between parent and child of Chinese immigrant
families, that have been stressed by Lin et al., arguing the role of filial piety in immigrant families
(2015). Transnationalism can also be part of the home culture, where contact and a network with the
country of origin is maintained. This can often be observed with immigrant groups, such as the Turkish
and the Moroccan community in the Netherlands, who often return to their country of origin during
summer breaks.

了解研究组在多大程度上认同其家庭文化至关重要，以便全面调查两种文化在他们的成长中的影响。这将形成对形成其身份的哪些变量有贡献的基本理解。例如，Noels 等人（1996年）曾论证了移民要同化到东道主社会，语言能力的必要性，但也必须考虑他们的母语能力。另一个例子是 Lin 等人强调的中国移民家庭中父母与子女之间的复杂关系，论述了移民家庭中孝道的作用（2015年）。跨国主义也可以是家庭文化的一部分，维持与原籍国的联系和网络。这种情况常常可以在荷兰的土耳其和摩洛哥社区中观察到，他们经常在暑假期间返回原籍国。

2. _How is their identity and belonging in Dutch society affected when they are experiencing_
    _discrimination, such as the increased discrimination to Asian people during the Covid- 19_
    _pandemic?_

   _当他们经历歧视时，如在 Covid-19 大流行期间对亚洲人的增加歧视，他们在荷兰社会中的身份和归属感如何受到影响？_
   
By recollecting participants’ past experiences and how this has affected their self-identification, one
can assess the impact this has had on individuals. Important experiences of exclusion in the host
society must be remarked so that their sense of belonging in the society can be pinpointed. As a case
example, the increased discrimination towards Asian people during the Covid-19 pandemic will be

通过回顾参与者的过去经历以及这些经历如何影响他们的自我认同，可以评估这对个体产生了哪些影响。必须注意到在东道主社会中的排斥经历，以便可以确定他们在社会中的归属感。以 Covid-19 大流行期间对亚洲人增加的歧视为案例，探讨此类事件如何改变他们在东道主社会中的归属感和身份。这种歧视可能会加剧他们的疏远感并降低被东道主社会接受的感觉，可能会加强与家庭文化的联系，作为支持和身份认同的来源。

utilized. It may be possible that some participants have not experienced this during the pandemic at
all, and therefore it is necessary to stretch the retrospect over their whole life, assessing important
events that have been of great impact on the participants.
在疫情期间，有些参与者可能根本没有经历过这种情况，因此有必要回顾他们一生中重要的、对他们产生重大影响的事件。

Discrimination and exclusion can come in different forms. Besides of the Covid-19 example, other cases
such as institutional discrimination or how Chinese people are portrayed in media can also be of
importance. As described in the problem statement, the second-generation Chinese immigrants have
become more vocal, thereby addressing the inequalities they face. Though this is a form of claiming a
place in society, discrimination can still exclude people from which may result in a negative sense of
belonging. As a result, one can identify with other groups where they attach to more, such as panethnic
groups.
歧视和排斥可以以不同形式出现。除了新冠疫情的例子外，其他案例如体制性歧视或媒体对中国人的刻画也可能很重要。正如问题陈述中所述，第二代华裔移民变得更加直言不讳，因而关注他们所面临的不平等现象。尽管这是争取社会地位的一种形式，歧视仍然可能将人们排斥在外，从而导致负面的归属感。因此，人们可能会认同他们更为依附的其他群体，如泛族裔群体。






3. _How is the integration, identity and belonging of second-generation Chinese immigrants in_
    _Dutch society imagined in the future?_
3. _未来第二代华裔移民在荷兰社会中的融合、身份认同和归属感将如何被展望？_
   
The #StopAsianHate protests can be interpreted as a moment where second-generation Chinese
immigrants organized themselves in order to publicly express their viewpoint. By participating in
protests, individuals signify their belonging and active integration in society. This sub question opens
up the opportunity to visualize the imagined future second-generation Chinese immigrants foresee for
themselves in the Netherlands. It is relevant to understand their perspective on what societal changes
are necessary in order to foster a greater sense of belonging. Moreover, it is worth exploring whether
such form of integration leads to a stronger identification with Dutch society or another form of
identification.

#停止亚裔仇恨的抗议活动可以被视为第二代华裔移民自发组织起来，公开表达他们观点的时刻。通过参加抗议活动，个人表明了自己在社会中的归属感和积极融合。这一分问题为我们提供了一个机会，可以展望第二代华裔移民对自己在荷兰的未来的想象。理解他们对社会变革的看法，对于促进更强的归属感而言至关重要。此外，还值得探讨这种形式的融合是否会导致他们对荷兰社会的更强认同，或者另一种形式的身份认同。

## 2. Conceptual framework 
## 2. 概念框架

### 2.1 Introduction
### 概念框架

In this chapter, I will elaborate on the existing and relevant literature, concepts and theories I will adopt
during my research. Identity is a concept widely discussed and can be manifested in many ways. I aim
to lay out the different sort of identities I find applicable in this research, but will start with a broad
conceptualization on the meaning of identity. Similarly, the conceptualization of belonging is also
discussed in greater detail. By gaining a precise understanding of the concepts, it becomes clear from
which perspective I aim to approach my research. Furthermore, a description is provided on the
different actors involved in a person’s identity shaping, where I lay extra focus on during the research.
Since second-generation Chinese are the target group, I believe integration is closely related to one’s
shaping of identity and sense of belonging. For that reason, I will apply the acculturation framework of
Berry, which can help to understand the approach an individual adopts when integrating in society.
The framework can also be a helpful to assess how society positions minority groups in a certain
category.

在本章中，我将详细阐述在我的研究中采用的现有和相关文献、概念和理论。身份是一个广泛讨论的概念，可以通过多种方式表现出来。我旨在列出在本研究中适用的不同身份类型，但首先将从广泛的身份概念化开始。同样，归属感的概念化也将详细讨论。通过对这些概念的精确理解，我希望能够明确我将从哪个角度进行研究。此外，还将描述在个人身份塑造过程中涉及的不同角色，我将在研究中对此给予特别关注。由于研究对象是第二代华裔，我认为融合与个人的身份塑造和归属感密切相关。为此，我将采用贝里（Berry）的文化适应框架，这有助于理解个人在融入社会时采取的方法。该框架也有助于评估社会如何将少数群体归类到特定类别中。

### 2.2 Conceptualizing identity and its different forms
### 2.2 概念化身份及其不同形式

In social science literature, identity is often distinguished in different categories, such as social identity,  ethnic identity, professional identity, gender identity and etcetera. According to Stryker & Burke et al. (1980 & 2009, as cited in Stets & Serpe 2013, p. 34), ‘’identity is a set of meanings attached to roles individuals occupy in the social structure, groups they identify with and belong to, and unique ways in which they see themselves’’. It is possible to have different identities, because a person can identify oneself to certain groups, but a person can also be ascribed to certain identities by others. Buckingham  (2008) argues that ‘’identity is something unique to each of us that we assume is more or less consistent over time. [...] on the other hand, identity also implies a relationship with a broader collective or social group of some kind’’. This is also supported by Jenkins’ (2004, p. 5) description, arguing that ‘’identity is our understanding of who we are and of who other people are, and reciprocally, other people’s understanding of themselves and of others (which includes us)’’.
Therefore, a careful distinction must be made between how a person identifies oneself, and how that
person is being identified by others. The negotiability of identity can reach to far extents. For example, the possibility of some governments that allow their citizens to change their sex and name
administratively, even though these identities have been ascribed to people from birth. This allows
citizens to acquire new identities. As a result, one can conclude that identity is subject to change over time and is not fixed (Behtoui, 2021; Itzigsohn et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2011). Remembering that

在社会科学文献中，身份通常被区分为不同的类别，如社会身份、种族身份、职业身份、性别身份等。根据Stryker和Burke等（1980 & 2009，引自Stets & Serpe 2013, p. 34）的说法，“身份是一组附属于个人在社会结构中所占据的角色、他们认同并属于的群体，以及他们自我认知的独特方式的意义。”一个人可能拥有不同的身份，因为一个人可以认同某些群体，但也可能被他人归于某些身份。Buckingham（2008）认为，“身份是我们每个人独特的东西，我们假定它在时间上或多或少是一致的。[...] 另一方面，身份也意味着与某种更广泛的集体或社会群体的关系。”这也得到了Jenkins（2004, p. 5）的描述支持，他认为“身份是我们对自己和他人的理解，反过来，他人对自己和他人的理解（包括我们）。” 因此，必须谨慎区分一个人如何自我认同，以及他人如何认同这个人。身份的可协商性可以达到很大的程度。例如，一些政府允许公民在行政上改变性别和姓名，尽管这些身份从出生起就已经赋予了人们。这使得公民可以获得新的身份。因此，可以得出结论，身份是随时间变化的，并不是固定的（Behtoui, 2021；Itzigsohn等，2005；Schwartz等，2011）。记住

```

identity is not fixed seems relevant for second-generation immigrants and this opens the possibility in
the emergence of new identities, such as panethnic and hybrid identities.

身份不是固定的，这对于第二代移民来说是相关的，这打开了新身份出现的可能性，如泛族群和混合身份。

Identification can be seen as a process that results in identity. It is the adaptation of other people’s
beliefs, values and standards as one’s own (Verkuyten, 2005). Kartosen (2016) argues that ‘’at the core
of identification lies the assumption that people are engaged in developing understandings and
articulations of their self’’. Self-identification is about the personal understandings of someone’s own
identity. In other words, this can be described as who someone thinks he or she is. An important aspect
in this are the associations a person has towards other people and groups. However, this process also
includes the learning of what is _not_ part of someone’s identity (Giddens, 1991). Ethnic self-
identification appears to be of relevance in the context of immigrants, since being in a host society can complicate the question to what ethnicity they think they belong. On the notion of ethnicity, race and nationhood, Brubaker (2002, p. 174) argues this can ‘’exist only in and through our perceptions,
interpretations, representations, categorizations and identifications. They are not things in the world,
but perspectives on the world’’. This is supported by Verkuyten (2005, p. 75), explaining that ‘’ethnicity has to do with a subjective belief in common origin, descent, and history’’. This refers to the intangibility of ethnicity, but also identity and the actual imagined realities people create for
themselves. Thus, when speaking of ethnic self-identification, it is about the level of association a
person identifies to an ethnic group.

身份认同可以看作是一个产生身份的过程。它是将他人的信仰、价值观和标准作为自己的适应过程（Verkuyten, 2005）。Kartosen（2016）认为，“身份认同的核心假设是，人们参与发展对自我的理解和表达。”自我认同是关于个人对自己身份的理解。换句话说，这可以描述为某人认为自己是谁。一个重要的方面是一个人对其他人和群体的关联。然而，这个过程也包括学习什么 _不是_ 某人身份的一部分（Giddens, 1991）。在移民背景下，种族自我认同似乎具有相关性，因为在一个东道社会中，确定自己认为属于哪种族群的问题会变得复杂。关于种族、种族和国家身份的概念，Brubaker（2002, p. 174）认为，这些“只能存在于我们的感知、解释、表述、分类和认同之中。它们不是世界上的事物，而是对世界的观点。”Verkuyten（2005, p. 75）也支持这一观点，解释说，“种族与共同起源、血统和历史的主观信仰有关。”这指的是种族的无形性，也包括身份和人们为自己创造的实际想象现实。因此，当谈论种族自我认同时，是指一个人与某个种族群体认同的程度。

When researching young Asian Dutch and the formation of their panethnic culture through Asian
popular culture, Kartosen (2016) used three cross-cutting aspects that together shape the concept of
identification. The application of this concept is highly relevant, since it has previously been applied
already by Kartosen in his research on second-generation Asians in the Netherlands. Unlike most
identity theories, Kartosen’s concept of identification has a focus on immigrants and values the
importance of belonging when people are constructing their identity. It places the individual at the
center and assumes the individual will identify with groups based on commonalities. Kartosen’s
concept of identification include ‘’three cross-cutting aspects: 1) self-categorization, 2) perception of
commonality and 3) feelings of belonging’’.

Self-categorization refers to ‘’a formal categorization of oneself as a member of a specific and well-
articulated social category based on attributes such as gender, nationality or ethnicity’’ (Kartosen,
2016, p. 25). Kartosen elaborates on this and states that this categorization can also be imagined and
perceived, making it possible that a Chinese immigrant can self-categorize as Dutch, for example. An
important remark must be made on the meaning of being ‘’Dutch’’ and ‘’Chinese’’ are given by


```
Conceptual framework
```
respondents, as this can have different meanings per person. Perception of commonality is about how
an individual sees him- or herself in another person or group. In panethnicity, this can for example
happen when language, music or physical appearances is the same or similar. Lastly, feelings of
belonging refer to what group a person identifies with because he or she feels a sense of belonging to
that group. As Kartosen describes, ‘’it requires an individual to construct the self as connected to, and
part of, a collectivity based on shared attributes, and to see the self in terms of what the group is’’.
When covering all three aspects, it becomes clear that self-identification can only exist when there is
(perceived) commonality and belonging to a group. Thus, if one of the aspects is ambiguous, a person
does not identify completely with a certain group. However, Kartosen developed this concept based
on the assumption that there would be a high level of panethnic affiliation towards Asian popular
culture. In this research, the possibility that a person does not completely identify with one group is
also taken into account. This can be an explanation on the development of certain concepts in identity
theory that open up the possibilities that there can be more than one identity. This will be further
discussed in the next paragraphs.

Without completely discarding the aforementioned concept of identification, the possibility that
people do not solely identify with one group must be kept open. This in-betweenness, described by
Fleischmann & Verkuyten (2016) as dual identity, multiple identification by Verkuyten et al. (2019), or
hyphenated identities by Bélanger & Verkuyten (2010), all refer to immigrants who identify both with
their home culture as well as with the host culture. While the greater part of immigrant studies focuses
on assimilation, acculturation and i(Lieber et al., 2001; Rosenthal & Feldman, 1990; Schwartz et al.,
2006; Tang & Merrilees, 2021)al., 2006; Tang & Merrilees, 2021), these approaches imply that
abandonment of one’s home culture is the ‘’end goal’’ and suggest a dichotomy between either
identifying oneself with the home culture or host society. Self-identification, dual identity and
hyphenated identities move away from this statement and put the focus on how immigrants actively
negotiate and construct their identities. Another synonym is the term hybridity (Bhabba, 1994; Hutnyk,
2005; Stepick et al., 2011), referring to identities that are shaped based on the contact made with
different cultures (Fay & Haydon, 2017). Being an immigrant can then also be used as an advantage,
since one can strategically move between different identities.

### 2.3 Conceptualizing belonging

When speaking of identification, the (sense of) belonging is a vital component in this. The desire to
belong and to be associated with a certain group is the social part of identity. When being part of a
group, there is also group pressure and expectations to be met (Giddens, 1991). Examples are the way


```
Conceptual framework
```
one looks, behaves or what language is spoken. This can work two ways; a person meets certain
requirements, thus feels a belonging to a group; or a group requires certain standards, thus a person
acts accordingly. Verkuyten (2005, p. 68) argues that despite of these in-group expectations, people
still ‘’want to attach themselves to someone or something, want to belong and feel at home in their
world’’. For immigrants, this need to belong to a group can even lead to broader group-identifications,
such as panethnicity. According to Okamoto & Mora (2014), panethnicity is shaped by ‘’immigrant
groups who have entered host societies with regional, national origin, and language differences and,
over time, have come together’’. It is a form of collective identification of different subgroups or tribes
(Cristina Mora, 2017). Often, what brings them together is a shared culture because their ancestry is
from the same regional area. Examples are Latino-Hispanics in the United States of America, where
multiple nationalities from South-American countries share a collective identification that leads to an
increased belonging to identify oneself as ‘’Latino/a’’. Asian parties organized in the Netherlands are
also a form of panethnicity, which are focused on and visited by people with an Asian heritage sharing
their interests in Asian popular culture in which they feel they belong (Kartosen, 2016). Asian parties
are an example of how belonging can be sought in spaces. Other examples are Chinese youth
immigrants creating new social spaces where they connect with others, such as social media and
playing video games online (Raffaetà et al., 2016). Kartosen also makes an important notion that
belonging and identity are not always the same, based on the argument that attachment to cultural
groups is not always linked to countries in a territorial sense. He concludes that ‘’one may culturally
identify as Chinese and not Dutch, while at the same time feeling a sense of belonging in the
Netherlands and not China’’.

As identities can be hybrid, so does belonging. This underlines their interdependence, since
identification towards a group is often accompanied by a strong sense of belonging. This hybridity was
also observed by Raffaetà et al. (2016), whom during their research on young Chinese in Prato, Italy,
concluded that there was a ‘’refusal to be categorized or pinned down, to insist on belonging as a
dynamic practice rather than a fixed achievement, is reflected in these responses that elude stasis:
feelings of belonging change according to time and space’’. Time and space, as Raffaetà et al. describe,
are highly influenced by acceptance levels towards Chinese immigrants by the local community.
Additionally, discrimination towards immigrants can lead to a decreased sense of belonging to the host
society and potentially result in ‘’reactive ethnicity’’, referring to the attachment to one’s home culture
and active resistance to adaptation to the host culture due to exclusion caused by discrimination
(Schwartz et al., 2010). Similarly, economic success and a sense of belonging to the host society are
correlated, as higher levels of economic success tend to lead to a stronger sense of belonging, while
poverty tends to result in a lower sense of belonging (Hou et al., 2018). Exclusion of a group can lead


```
Conceptual framework
```
to a feeling of non-belonging to any group, which is imaginable for immigrants who have given up some
of their home culture values in order to integrate into a new host society (Anthias, 2002; (2017) Soto
Saavedra et al., 2023). When they are then excluded from their host society, they find themselves in-
between two cultures where they neither feel a strong sense of belonging to. Based on the literature,
it can be concluded that belonging refers to what group and place a person feels attached to, therefore
also coined by some as where people feel ‘’at home’’ (Antonsich, 2010; Hou et al., 2018; Korteweg,
2017). It is therefore a more social dynamic practice, while identity seeks more the uniqueness of a
person (Stets & Serpe, 2013). Perhaps this is best explained by Anthias (2013), who claims that
‘’belonging asks about ‘to what’ and ‘with whom’ you are a member, ‘where’ and ‘by whom’ you are
accepted and you feel attached to, rather than who you are’’. As a consequence, careful notion must
be taken that even though they often contribute useful understanding to one another, identity and
belonging are not the same.

As mentioned before, the formation of identity is highly influenced by external factors. It is therefore
relevant to highlight the different actors who are of importance in identity formation of second-
generation Chinese immigrants. Below follows a description of these actors whom can play a crucial
role in the research.

### 2.4 Relevant actors

Firstly, the host society and its acceptance towards a minority group can play an important part of the
sense of belonging of an individual. Obviously, the ‘’host society’’ is a hard to define subject and thus
deserves clarification. It is not possible to include everyone and everything from the host society, and
neither should the Netherlands be seen as a homogeneous unity. It is rather a combination of social
and political discourses towards (Chinese) immigrants, leading to a certain level of acceptance. For
example, the reception of immigrants can be highly influenced by which political party has the majority
in the government, and is subject to shift. But most importantly, the host society should be defined by
how the researched group experiences their presence in the society. It is a matter of exposure and
what is deemed to be of importance. There is the possibility that a few experiences of discrimination
can already lead to a negative sense of belonging. Though it is a small event in the sense of time, it can
be of high impact on the researched group.

The culture that the researched group is exposed to from their parents, is defined as the ‘’home
culture’’. A major part that distinguishes cultures are shared norms and values. When the norms and
values from someone’s home culture differ from the host society, it can lead to complications for a


```
Conceptual framework
```
person in which ones to prioritize. The more the two cultures differ from each other, the harder it can
be for immigrants to integrate into the host society. In addition, Lou et al. (2020) have defined the
correlation between language proficiency and integration of immigrants, but also addressed the
mismatch between policymakers in language education and immigrants learning abilities and
competencies. As the Chinese language is very distanced from Dutch, it can make it difficult for Chinese
immigrants to master the Dutch language. This in turn can have consequences on the second-
generation, since their home culture creates a barrier for them to integrate into the host society. The
upbringing that second-generation Chinese enjoy is an important way of how they conceptualize the
home culture. As their parents are the first point of reference in the home culture, the upbringing has
a significant role in how meanings are given to the home culture.

The second-generation of Chinese immigrants is raised within two different cultures. Even though
identity shaping is highly personal and each person does so differently, the fact that this group is
bicultural therefore makes it even more interesting. The application of relevant theory can reveal more
on how this process takes place at an individual level. The importance of the host society and home
culture have been described above, but there might be more variables that are given importance by
the researched individual. Indeed, through the perception of how the individual interprets the host
society and home culture, one can better comprehend how the process of identification takes place.
Therefore, an important actor to take into consideration is the individual self, where the sensemaking
of one’s identity and belonging takes place.

### 2.5 Integration

It is inevitable that immigrants come into contact with the culture and practices of the host society.
This triggers a process, that has been described as ‘’acculturation’’, meaning the ‘’culture change that
results from continuous, first-hand contact between two distinct cultural groups’’ (Redfield et al., 1936,
as cited in Berry, 1992). Acculturation can be manifested through different forms, based on acceptance
from the host society, willingness to acculturate, but also the cultural differences can play a role. It is
important for the wellbeing of individuals, since acculturation can foster positive social relations (J. W.
Berry, 2005, p. 702). However, throughout this thesis, the term ‘’integration’’ is adopted more
frequently when referring to the engagement in the host society and its culture. Reason for this is
because integration is the most common term used in the Netherlands when immigrants come in
contact with the host society. It implies a certain amount of being part of society, but I believe
integration is also the right term because second-generation Chinese are first exposed to their home


```
Conceptual framework
```
culture from their parents. Only later in life, they come in contact with the host society, and therefore
need to integrate when engaging with the society.

Berry et al. (2017) uses the acculturation framework in order to understand how individuals seek to
acculturate. It is a relevant theory that can help to understand the position and approaches adopted
by participants when integrating into the host society. Four strategies are proposed, which depend on
two variables; the degree they wish to maintain their heritage culture, and the degree they wish to
have contact and engage with the host society. For example, a strong affiliation towards the host
society and its culture make it plausible that the participant will also identify as such. Integration is
therefore a useful asset in order to understand an individual’s identity and belonging. As Berry et al.
explain:

```
‘’Integration is the strategy when there is a desire to maintain heritage culture and identity and
at the same time to engage with others outside the own group; assimilation is the strategy
when there is little or no desire to maintain heritage culture and identity, and to engage (even
merge into) the larger society; separation is the strategy when there is a strong desire to
maintain heritage culture and identity, and to avoid engaging the larger society as much as
possible; marginalization is the strategy when there is no desire to maintain heritage culture
and identity, and also to avoid engaging with the larger society.’’
```
Through this framework, an understanding of participants’ identity and belonging can take place. It is
a strategy that each individual adopts for itself. By studying the driving factors such as family relations
and acceptance from the host society, one can comprehend why a certain strategy is chosen. Push and
pull factors from the external environment can play a role in the strategies adopted. Acculturation
allows for individuals to develop their own identity between two cultures. According to Verkuyten
(2005, p. 161), the Dutch population, as socially shared beliefs, prefers assimilation from ethnic
minority groups in all domains of life. This is similar to Israeli discourse, where immigrants are placed
under great pressure to assimilate (Oznobishin & Kurman, 2018, p. 237). This so called perceived
assimilation pressure, is also seen in France, where there is a ‘’colorblind approach to the assimilation
of newcomers’’ (Huddleston & Scholten, 2022, p. 343). These instances show that assimilation is often
seen as an end goal by host societies, expecting immigrants to become similar to the host society and
disregard their own culture. In this thesis, Berry’s acculturation framework therefore provides us with
a useful lens through which a better understanding can arise on self-identity and sense of belonging of
second-generation Chinese immigrants, paying particular attention to the intersection of the home
culture and host society, and their navigation in it.

```
Figure 1: Berry’s acculturation framework (1997)
```
With this thesis, I hope to make a contribution to the existing literature by applying different methods
while researching the identity and belonging of my researched group. For example, by using Kartosen’s
(2016) three cross-cutting aspects on the concept of identification and Berry’s (2017) acculturation
framework interchangeably, I adopt a hybrid approach in assessing my data. The group of second-
generation Chinese in the Netherlands has a relatively small size. Existing literature is therefore more
often focused on more dominant minority groups, such as the aforementioned immigrant groups that
settled in the Netherlands from post-colonial territories or due to labor migration. Furthermore,
research on immigrants’ identities has a large focus on first-generation immigrants and is often
conducted with a quantitative approach in order to analyze statistics between host society and
minority groups. With my research, I hope to make a contribution to the literature by researching a
group that is underrepresented in academic research with the help of literature, concepts and theories
that have been applied to other groups before.

Methodology
```
## 3 Methodology

### 3.1 Research design and data collection

In order to answer the aforementioned research questions, a qualitative research methodology has
been adopted. By employing a qualitative approach, a deeper and more comprehensive exploration
was undertaken to gather data. This choice is particularly relevant to the research questions at hand,
as they are aimed towards personal experiences of the participants. The research of identity and
belonging requires a flexible approach, given that these concepts can have different forms of
understanding for people. Qualitative research enables a personal approach and therefore provide the
necessary flexibility to explore the diverse meanings that people attribute to their identity and sense
of belonging. Furthermore, experiences of discrimination and racism may bear relevance to the
research questions, a more personal approach could therefore lead to a more open attitude for
participants to share such experiences, thus increasing the internal validity of the responses.

Data collection was conducted through semi-structured interviews with second-generation Chinese
immigrants in the Netherlands. Semi-structured interviews are favored as a data collection method
when the research aims to gain insight into the individual participant’s specific viewpoint, rather than
seeking a generalized understanding of a phenomenon (Adeoye‐Olatunde & Olenik, 2021). It allows
for in-depth follow up questions and a flexible approach that makes the interview more personal. I
have visited an event where I have done observations on the first- and second-generation Chinese.
This was a funeral I attended of Mary van der Made-Yuen, who was the director and founder of Chinese
school Kai Wah in Amsterdam. Numerous first- and second-generation individuals attended the
funeral, in which afterwards was an informal reception. These observations enrich the data collection
and is a valuable extension. When selecting participants, the ‘’snowball sampling’’ method was applied
in order to come in touch with other participants. This method is particularly useful when working with
hard-to-reach populations. Therefore, the process involves building a sample through referrals of
current participants (O’leary, 2004, p. 110). By asking the first round of participants for
recommendations within their own social network of people who might be interested, a cumulative
pool of potential participants was established.

An advantage of studying an immigrant population is the presence of organizations and networks that
aim to connect individuals sharing the same culture and interests. Engaging with these organizations
can provide valuable access to their networks and members. In particular, initiatives such as Yang’s
Voices Podcast and Asian Raisins, which focus on addressing Chinese/Asian discrimination in the

Netherlands, have the expertise that can be of great value for this thesis. Their input serves as a
valuable complement to the data collection of the researched group. Data collection from these
organizations was also done through the application of semi-structured interviews, since this seems
most suitable for a flexible yet personal approach. All data collection was done in Dutch, which is a
common language spoken by second-generation Chinese immigrants.

### 3.2 Data analysis

Interviews were recorded with the consent of the interviewees and afterwards transcribed and coded.
Throughout interviews, notes were taken on topics considered to be of special importance. This
allowed for the researcher to promptly reply on important topics that could lead to follow-up
questions. Furthermore, remarkable observations were noted down. Transcription of recorded
interviews was done as soon as possible, as the observations made during the interview could be
incorporated accordingly. Observations, such as extended pauses or uncertain intonations, can provide
valuable contextual information and were incorporated in the transcript. I therefore aimed to
transcribe promptly after interviewing. Afterwards, coding was applied to all transcriptions, and from
these codes the findings were written.

Interviews were conducted over a course of two months. Because of logistical reasons, some
interviews were conducted online through Microsoft Teams. For easier reference, the researched
group may be referred to as ‘’the second-generation’’ or ‘’second-generation individuals’’ in the
findings. An overview of the participants is included in the appendix.

### 3.3 Ethical considerations

Interviewing is a qualitative research method that relies on building trust and confidence with the
interviewee since participants share their personal experiences. Creating a safe and comfortable
environment enables participants to feel at ease. One way I achieved this was to carefully select
appropriate venues for the interviews. This was established by letting participants choose their
preferred venue. To ensure confidentiality, data is processed anonymously, unless consent is
specifically given. This was the case in the interviews with Yang’s Voices Podcast and Asian Raisins. It
is the responsibility of the researcher to inform participants about the objectives of the research and
thereby preparing participants for the interview and avoiding any unexpected surprises. As part of
informed consent, voluntary participation is deemed crucial and therefore consent was obtained
beforehand. Research is done based on the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (Algra


```
Methodology
```
et al., 2018), which is applied by all universities in the Netherlands. Participants were given the option
to receive a copy of the thesis.

### 3.4 Positionality

Positionality as a researcher is important to be aware of who you are as a researcher. As the author of
this thesis, I must be transparent on my own background. As I am of Chinese descent, I have affiliations
with the researched group. The main reason I chose this research topic is because I am sincerely
interested in how other second-generation individuals shape their identity and belonging in the
Netherlands. It is a topic that I am working on myself in daily life, and knowing I am not the only one, I
am curious to hear other people’s perspectives. I feel a strong connection to my home culture, and
therefore I believe I am the right person to conduct this research. I can relate to the participants
because to a large extent, we share the same life experiences. I believe participants are more inclined
to open up and share their stories with me, as there can be a perception of commonality since I have
the same cultural background, which can lead to mutual understandings. As I analyze the data and
examine the research findings, I will actively seek to draw connections with my own personal
experiences, aiming to offer an additional layer of examples from a realistic perspective. By doing so, I
can make suitable comparisons between participants’ experiences and my own. Moreover, this
approach will enable me to explore potential variations in how other second-generation Chinese
individuals navigate their sense of identity and belonging, and may make it easier to comprehend the
entangled reasons of how and why these differences arise.

### 4.1 Introduction

The quote at the start of this chapter is from Mary van der Made-Yuen. She was the director of the
Chinese school Kai Wah in Amsterdam and was an important figure in the Chinese community in
Amsterdam. She helped first-generation Chinese with integrating, and second-generation Chinese to
learn Chinese. As a teacher, she valued education and helping others the most. In my early childhood,
Mary taught me the basics in Chinese writing. I mostly remember her as a senior woman with a small
posture, but with such fierceness and passion for educating the second-generation Chinese. In July
2023, she passed away at age 90. When I went to her funeral, I noticed the large amount of visitors.
Among them were first-, second- and third- generation Chinese, and a significant amount of Dutch
visitors. Through recollections shared at her funeral, I learned that Mary was a strong proponent that
the Chinese diaspora in the Netherlands would integrate into the host society. She believed that
through acceptance of a new culture, one can find belonging in the Netherlands. The quote at the
previous page is a message she wanted the priest to share with the audience at her funeral, and
symbolizes the importance of embracing both the Chinese and Dutch culture. Her funeral was not
traditionally Chinese, but kept simple and without flowers, as Mary resented flowers because they only
have a short life span. Mary helped countless Chinese to find their belonging in the Netherlands
without losing their cultural values.

Integration is ‘’when individuals maintain their culture and are able to accept and adapt to the host’s
cultures’’ (Lee et al., 2010). Also, integration ‘’involves contact and ide(Lebedeva & Tatiana A., 2016)s’’
(Lebedeva & Tatiana A., 2016). It is therefore the most appropriate term to adopt since participants
inherit the home culture from their parents through their upbringing, and are exposed to the culture
of the host society outside of their ethnic group. As discovered through my research, integration
assumes a significant role in the construction of one’s identity and belonging, because it enriches
personal experiences and fosters positive relationships in the host society. Without any form of
integration, immigrants would be isolated from their host society and as a result would find a hard
time to find belonging in their new place of residence. Second-generation Chinese are automatically
exposed to the host society in daily life, such as school, classmates and work. Through integration, the
researched group can find a connection with the host society which can be beneficial for identity
formation. According to Giuliani et al., (2018) ‘’positive adaptation outcomes imply that immigrants
are able to navigate between their own heritage culture and the host culture and to integrate them’’.
The extent to these identities are largely influenced by integration, signifying the role it has on
participants.


```

In this chapter, the goal is to answer my first sub question, which aims to explore to what extent the
host society and home culture play a role in belonging and identity shaping. I elaborate on integration
which was stimulated by parents, but also to what extent participants were expected to maintain the
Chinese cultural identity and values. Hence, the first part is dedicated to their upbringing, parental
expectations and the link towards integration. I have chosen to largely concentrate on integration,
because the degree of integration is relevant in order to understand one’s belonging and identity. The
second part of this chapter explores how participants try to integrate into society while being
confronted with stereotypes and discrimination from the same society. In this, it relates to the second
sub question. In general, the aim of this chapter is to discover how second-generation Chinese navigate
their own lives through pressures and expectations from their Chinese home culture, and from the
host society. As this chapter is focused on integration, the next chapter is dedicated to identity and
belonging, which can be understood better when having elaborated on integration first.

### 4 .2 Integrating with parental expectations

Evidently, all participants were urged by their parents to integrate to some degree, albeit with
noticeable differences in motivation. As observed with all participants, there was a high focus on
excelling academically. The pursuit of excellence in school can serve as an explanation of the relatively
high socio-economic status observed among Chinese immigrants (Gijsberts et al., 2011a). Children are
taught to do well in school through which success in life is envisioned. This approach to parenting aligns
with the phenomenon of the ‘’tiger mother’’, characterized by ‘’mothers of Chinese (or other ethnic)
origin who are highly controlling and authoritarian, denying their children free time, play dates, and
extracurricular activities in order to drive them to high levels of success at any cost’’ (Chua, 2011, as
cited in Juang et al., 2013). Some scholars have now developed this concept towards ‘’tiger parenting’’,
and according to Juang et al., it has similar features to the tiger mother and this is described as ‘’overly
high academic expectations and pressure to succeed, lack of open parent-child communication’’. As
economically driven immigrants, the first-generation knew the struggle of having financially limited
resources. By performing well in school, it is believed that high positioned livelihoods can be obtained
which will result in less financial burdens. Participant 13 recalls the following:

```
‘’It was always nurtured by my father. Yes, you have to study, if you study hard you will get a
good job later and then you don’t have to work as hard as dad. And I had cousins who were all
doing well in school, from there I would also feel pressure. When the advice from school was
for me to start in VWO, he was super super proud.’’
```

```
Family and host society pressures
```
I was introduced to participant 13 by participant 14. Unfortunately, planning the interview was
obstructed several times and the only suitable option was to conduct the interview online. Her spouse
is Australian and together they have two children, resulting in continuous redefining of their identities.
Her children are raised with Dutch, Cantonese Chinese, and English language, since she finds it
important they inherit their parents’ cultural identities. However, she believes her children will most
likely self-identify with the host society later in life, because she gears her parenting towards active
engagement in the society. In the case of participant 13 her childhood, she was expected to study,
obtain an occupation with high wages so she would not have to endure the hard work her father had
to do. Her mother was responsible for the caretaking of her and her siblings, and she remembers her
upbringing as very strict from the beginning.

I noticed how participants thought they integrated well into the host society as they linked high
academic achievements and high positioned livelihoods with integration. In order to achieve this,
active participation in society is believed to be necessary and therefore participants in general think
that the second-generation Chinese is well integrated. High academic achievements does not directly
mean there is integration towards the host society, but it does mean there is active participation in
society. Participant 18 explains how it is inherent to Chinese culture to ‘’be productive and participate
in society. You need to adjust to the bigger whole’’. I can therefore understand why participants think
they integrate well, because their parents did not only expect them to achieve the highest possible,
but also to be meaningful to society. In order to understand the identity formation better, an attempt
must be made to segregate integration, and parental expectations. By studying the parental
expectations that second-generation Chinese experienced, I learned why participants were urged to
integrate. An argument is coined by participant 15 and 8 respectively:

```
‘’What plays a role is the urge to proof yourself. Everything that you could not achieve as a
parent, your children will have to achieve it for you, so that means the children get a lot of
pressure.’’
```
```
‘’They would really insist on that I would do my best. [...] It was never enough, you always had
to achieve the greatest, because my father did not want me to end up working in the
restaurant. [...] They want you to have a good job, good future and make a lot of money. And
respect and status, that is something very Asian. For example, if you are not a doctor or
astronaut, you’re nothing.’’
```

```
Family and host society pressures
```
By attaining high results in school, second-generation individuals would meet their parents’
expectations. The usual point of departure is that participants were expected to achieve the highest
possible. A part of this expectation can also be to integrate, which can be explained through the
aforementioned Chinese cultural believes that you must be ‘’productive and participate in society’’
(participant 18). This is also partially explained in the last citation, by participant 8. In Chinese culture,
status and pride have significant importance. By integrating into a new society, higher possibilities of
achieving high positioned livelihoods is imagined and therefore, integration is associated as success.
At times, I could observe that the parental expectations was not always to integrate, but rather to
achieve the highest possible. Second-generation Chinese have to endure a great burden of parental
pressure through these expectations (Gijsberts et al., 2011b). I discovered that this pressure leads to
complex identity formation, since they have been pushed to participate in society, while it is also
expected to maintain Chinese cultural values. The relationship with parents and their upbringing is an
important facet in the identity formation of the participants. This is highlighted by participant 11:

```
‘’I’ve lived here my whole life, but I’d still say I am more Hong Kongese than Dutch. Because I
was raised traditionally, I think I really am a Hong Kongese, even though I have few Chinese
friends.’’
```
I got in contact with participant 11 through participant 8 , who have been acquainted with each other
since Chinese school. Though the interview was conducted online through Microsoft Teams, he was
very talkative and open to share his stories. Before starting the interview, he asked me many questions
on how I look at my own identity and belonging. It was very welcoming and a pleasant way to get to
know each other, also in a way that was related to the interview. Participant 11 had notions of critique
on how his parents expected him to integrate, but realizes it was with good intentions. If he were to
have children, he prefers to raise them traditionally Chinese, similar to his own upbringing. I noticed
how much his upbringing has shaped him as the person he is today, and how he values his home
culture.

When his grades for school were unsatisfactory, participant 11 was sent for additional coaching after
regular school. As a child, he was not able to process all the extra classes and it turned out to be
counterproductive. He described this behavior from Chinese parents as ‘’taking care of a plant by giving
it too much water. Instead of growing, the plant drowns. This was purely out of love. They wanted me
to have an advantage to my classmates in school by following extra classes’’. This is an example where
the parenting received does not result in better integration of the participant, even though the
intention might have been so. Though his parents expected high academic achievements, he believed


```
Family and host society pressures
```
this was not the right way to integrate. He discovered other second-generation Chinese around him
did not speak Dutch that well, and noticed how it influenced his own Dutch language proficiency
negatively. As a result, he decided to surround himself with more Dutch people in order to become
more proficient in Dutch. By consciously assessing what would be best for his own integration, he made
a deliberate choice to do it differently than how his parents had envisioned.

I came to realize participants would often talk about integration as in something that was measurable,
such as their socio-economic status, education, occupation and etcetera. I observed this phenomenon
also at times in literature (Day & Badou, 2019; Rijkschroeff, 1998). While these indicators do not
guarantee actual integration in the sense of accepting and adapting to the host society’s culture, I
could see the meaning to integration was often given to indicate their willingness to participate in
society. When I asked participants about how they think the second-generation Chinese is integrated,
different meanings were given. For instance, participant 11 related integration with his command of
the Dutch language, while participant 8 looked at the high numbers of interracial relations fellow
second-generation Chinese have in her environment. Though these are indeed examples of
integration, I have also observed instances where participants were not able to integrate freely and
were faced with limitations because of their strict upbringing. Because of this, it was a barrier for some
participants to explore their own identity, whether this would be Dutch or Chinese.

The authoritarian profile of tiger parenting leaves little room for discussion, and the limited freedom
they experienced left little possibilities open for identity exploration. I did not detect much resistance
was given towards their parents in their youth, which can be explained through filial piety. Filial piety
is explained by Liem & Kwan (2000), it ‘’commands the younger in the family to be respectful and
obedient to one’s parents and other elderly members related to the family’’. The family hierarchy is
based on age and therefore, children must obey the authority of their parents. It aligns with
collectivistic nature of Chinese culture, where family status and values are of importance. The well-
being of the family is more important than the individual (Gijsberts et al., 2011a). This helps to
comprehend tiger parenting, where little attention is given to personal well-being of the child, where
Qin (2008) draws the correlation to the ‘’achievement/adjustment paradox’’ second-generation
Chinese are facing. As such, I noticed the development of personal identity formation was not
prioritized by the participants’ parents.

The authoritative nature of tiger parenting results in poor psychological and social well-being
adjustment of children (Qin, 2008). After the interview, participant 2 explained how this has influenced
his well-being and how he is facing his traumatic experiences now at age 47. I got to interview


```
Family and host society pressures
```
participant 2 because he is the father of an acquaintance of mine. Though I met him once briefly, he
was very open in sharing vivid memories of his childhood and his experiences as a second-generation
individual. He invited me to conduct the interview at his home, where we had the time to talk freely
about our experiences as second-generation Chinese. Though we have quite some difference in age, I
could relate to his experiences since our upbringing shared many similarities. He told me he is
confronting the traumatic parts of his upbringing by visiting a psychiatrist now, where he hopes to
learn how to deal with the little affection and high expectations he experienced from his parents.

Participant 2 understands his parents’ situation, but does accuse them of not integrating properly.
With this, he was referring to his parents not adapting to Dutch norms and values in raising children.
When he moved to Groningen to study, he felt relieved because the relationship with his parents felt
suffocating. Because he never confronted his parents, he hopes to find inner peace now by attending
therapy. Why participant 2, similar to other participants, never confronted his parents can be explained
through the aforementioned filial piety, where it is expected to obey your parents. I discovered that
among some participants, this obedience was at times exercised through domestic violence from their
parents. I recognize this from my own upbringing, but was surprised to discover that other participants
experienced the same. In these family dynamics, it is apparent that integration was not always a free
choice for many participants, but could also be dictated if the parents would require so.

Strict parenting seems to be the norm, but it was not observed in all participants’ upbringing, as
participants 4, 9 and 1 4 experienced a lot of freedom in their childhood. It shows that generalizations
cannot be made and each upbringing was different to one another. Again, by using the perspective of
the tiger parenting phenomenon, it becomes clear that for the majority of participants their priorities
were set on specific elements in the upbringing, resulting in a lack of development in other areas. This
is highlighted by participant 2, who explains:

```
‘’Many parents of second-generation Chinese here, they knew poverty. And that is logical, that
they say; ‘well, my children are not going to suffer what I have suffered, so I want them to be
successful in school in order to get a good job and a good salary and etcetera’. A nice car, a
pretty car. But then you sacrifice a lot of things. And that is integrating socially.’’
```
As participant 2 stresses, integrating socially was lacking in his upbringing. This was not being
promoted, and he has clear memories of how his freedom was restricted, resulting in less social contact
with children of his age. Another example he gave was how Wednesday afternoons in the Netherlands
is a free afternoon for primary school children. While all children would watch popular animated


```
Family and host society pressures
```
cartoons on television, he had to spend his afternoons at Chinese school. Recordings were not possible
and he recalls that he only experienced some animated cartoons through his imaginations and
recollections from classmates who had to summarize what happened the next morning. Similar to all
other participants who went to Chinese school, this was an expectation enforced by parents. As a
result, the story of participant 2 can serve as an example how there was an obstacle for him to integrate
because of his upbringing. While his parents expected him to integrate by doing well in school, he
missed the social aspect of integrating. Furthermore, he critiques the Chinese parenting in a more
general sense and highlights this is doomed to lead to friction in the host society:

```
‘’They (the second-generation) have become soldiers, because you (Chinese parents) shape
them to become soldiers. They won’t become leaders. Because what do leaders do? Leaders
speak up and fight for their ideals. Soldiers are good to listen and obey. [...] Because of their
upbringing, they have been told; ‘what you say, what your opinion is, it is not important. Our
opinion is important and you should copy that.’’’
```
As academic achievements are key to success for tiger parents, there is little focus on social skills. By
belittling children in the household, a fear of developing these skills is created and the metaphor that
tiger parenting creates obeying soldiers can then be understood. Many participants described the
Chinese culture as ‘’non-confrontational’’, and one way to do that is to remain in the background and
not cause trouble. Participant 10 describes it as; ‘’just work hard, remain in the background and don’t
make any fuss’’. Participant 7 described it as; ‘’remain quiet and join the crowd, do not create a fuss.
That is how my parents think, do not complicate it’’. Participant 6 describes it as; ‘’remain modest and
keep your problems to yourself’’. Participant 17 describes it as; ‘’I also noticed I had trouble shaping
my opinion in school. I didn’t even know what that was. And I am still confronted with this at work’’.
Participant 8 describes it as; ‘’if I was walking on the street and someone yelled ‘Ching Chang Chong’,
I keep my mouth shut and just walk on’’. All these instances describe the outcomes of their upbringing
where they were taught to avoid conflict and remain in the background. Compared to my own
upbringing, I can see similarities in the experiences of my participants. Whilst growing up, my parents
were authoritative and would expect me to behave in the way they taught me. Any revolt would
promptly be replied with more authority, where I would quickly learn it is best not to speak up. As a
child, I then realized the easiest way was to avoid the conflict and do as was expected of me. This
behavior is then duplicated in adulthood, which explains the non-confrontational nature of many
second-generation Chinese.


```
Family and host society pressures
```
The parents of participant 9 are of Chinese descent but lived in Indonesia before migrating to the
Netherlands. I met participant 9 with the help of participant 2. They have been friends because they
used to be neighbors and their children are about the same age. I was invited to his home since I could
also interview his spouse, participant 10, afterwards. The mother and sister of participant 10 were also
in the living room when I entered, and I was offered Hong Kong style milk tea. I learned the mother of
participant 10 lives with them and was given compliments by her on the research I am doing. After a
brief chat with everyone, I was able to start the interview. At first, I was uncertain if participant 9 would
fit the research group because of his parents’ migratory background in Indonesia, but when he
explained he has more affiliations towards Chinese culture than to Indonesian culture, I was assured
that his input could give a meaningful dynamic in my results. Though he identifies as Dutch, he notices
how some of his characteristics can be explained through the Chinese culture that he was raised with.
He described how a training program in his work is organized to help employees with a migrant
background. He joined this program recently and realized his upbringing led to certain obstacles he
was only discovering now, and he is facing challenges to separate his true self and the upbringing he
enjoyed:

```
‘’I was not raised to get up on a high horse and brag, beat myself on the chest and to say I am
the best [...] I was raised with a certain amount of modesty, but at some point you need to make
the switch, leave modesty behind and place yourself on the foreground. I have trouble asking
for help and think I can solve issues by myself. This has positive and negative sides. Especially
in the beginning, colleagues think it’s great because they don’t need to look after you. But when
I’m facing a challenge above my capabilities, I’m too late with asking for help.’’
```
It was only through this program where participant 9 realized the effects of his upbringing. By reflecting
deeply on his own personality, he discovered that some of his character traits were deeply rooted from
his upbringing and formed an obstacle for him to integrate into Dutch work culture. Even though he
enjoyed a liberal upbringing which resulted in his identification towards the host society, he discovered
he still had trouble integrating the way he imagined. I recognize his yearning for answers, as I had
moments in my life where I was questioning the same. I think these questions become especially
pronounced when being confronted with certain shortcomings in society, and the readiness to self-
reflect. Chinese parenting tends to have a large focus on satisfying parents’ wishes, meaning there is
little attention for development of certain soft skills, such as communication, creativity and emotional
intelligence. While searching for identity and belonging, I came to the conclusion that these
shortcomings only arise as such when interacting and integrating with the host society, articulating the


```
Family and host society pressures
```
differences between our home culture and the host society. Another example where the upbringing
can be seen as an obstacle for integration is shared by participant 17, who explains:

```
‘’My mother also said that we are Chinese, and that is why we do it like that. At one point, she
demanded we would speak Cantonese with each other. Because we learned Dutch pretty
quickly, my mother didn’t speak Dutch that well and couldn’t understand us anymore. So she
said; ‘at home we only speak Cantonese’ [...] it was very contradicting, because our father
demanded us to learn Dutch. My sister had another Chinese girl in her class, and he specifically
said not to sit next to her.’’
```
I lived in Haarlem for a short period of time. During that time, I frequently visited the Chinese
restaurant in the neighborhood and got acquainted with the owner. When I started my data collection,
I asked the owner if she knew anyone who would be interested to participate in my research, and she
introduced me to participant 17. Participant 17 is married to her Dutch spouse and they have two
children. She invited me to conduct the interview at her home, since her two children were off from
school due to the summer holiday. I noticed nothing in her house had notions of Chinese culture.
During the interview, there were several moments we got distracted, but she was very patient to
answer my questions in detail nonetheless. She aims to benefit from her bicultural environment and
tries to raise her children in the best way possible, hoping that she can continue to assess objectively
in what she wants to adopt from her own upbringing.

As participant 17 did not speak any Dutch on her first day at school because she only learned Cantonese
Chinese at home, she had a disadvantage compared to her classmates. While her Dutch progressed
rapidly since being exposed to the host society, she was later expected to only speak Cantonese at
home. As her mother was mainly responsible for the daily parenting, participant 17 had to accompany
her when she was visiting her Chinese friends. As they also had children her age, she played with them
and the common language was Cantonese. While her father was trying to stimulate her and her sisters
to integrate, she was being held back by her mother. What became apparent was that her mother did
not spend much effort to integrate herself, and this reflected in the parenting she gave to participant

17. Her mother would still expect her to do well in secondary school, but also wanted her to continue
with Chinese school, even though the study load became too much. It is therefore important to realize
that the tiger parenting role her mother used was contradictive to her father’s expectations and did
not result in a more pleasant childhood. As this was not new to her, she taught herself the best ways
to navigate in this environment and in the end was allowed to quit Chinese school by convincing her


```
Family and host society pressures
```
father. Though tiger parenting can in some cases result in better integration, it has little focus on the
self-esteem of children, as also argued by Wang et al. (2016) and Cheah et al. (2013). In the long term,
low self-esteem can result in negative integration into the host society (Verkuyten, 1994). It is
therefore important to realize that tiger parenting does not necessarily equal better integration of the
second-generation.

The relation between upbringing and integration was also evident in participant 14, but then from the
opposite direction. My mother introduced me to participant 14 as they have known each other for
many years. Participant 14 is 53 years old and runs a small restaurant with her husband in Breda. My
first thought was that she would have a strong Chinese identity because she is acquainted with my
mother, but I soon realized she identifies much more as Dutch than I expected. As she discovered, her
attachment to the host society’s culture was due to how her parents looked at integration. As the
youngest of three, she enjoyed much freedom and did not have many obligations, such as helping in
her parents’ restaurant or go to Chinese school. The aforementioned tiger parenting was not part of
her upbringing. As she described, her parents were already misfits in the Chinese community, and felt
a strong belonging to the Netherlands. A better understanding arises as participant 14 illustrates when
her father was being interviewed about his identity in 1975 and asked when he would remigrate to
Hong Kong:

```
‘’My father responded; ‘why should I return? I am Dutch’. [...] Now I understand why I always
felt Dutch. I was five years old and if my father said this already at that time, then I have been
very much raised with this mindset.’’
```
As this chapter so far has had a large focus on parental expectations, it is also relevant to highlight an
example where there was less of it. As participant 14 experienced a childhood filled with freedom in a
Dutch environment, her identity has been attuned to her own surrounding, namely Dutch. She was
given the liberty to explore and integrate into the Dutch society. Furthermore, she and her family had
little to no contact with other Chinese. Her parents had a Chinese restaurant, allowing them to interact
with Dutch people. During her childhood, an absence of parental expectations could be observed,
resulting in a firm Dutch identity. Through the acculturation framework from Berry et al. (2017),
participant 14 would fit in the assimilation strategy, where complete assimilation towards the Dutch
culture is observed and there is little or no desire to identify with her Chinese heritage. It shows the
large scope of acculturation second-generation individuals find themselves in.

### 4.3 Navigating host society pressures

As second-generation immigrants, participants can develop strong connections to both Chinese and
Dutch identities. Since identity is about one’s own perception of being, this struggle becomes
particularly pronounced when their physical appearance does not match the dominant appearance of
the Dutch population. This mismatch can lead to feelings of difference and exclusion. In his book _De
bananengeneratie_ (The banana-generation), Wu (2019) discusses the impact of stereotypes and
underrepresentation of Chinese in the media. The title in his book refers to second-generation Chinese
in the Netherlands, a term used to describe individuals who (to some degree) identify culturally as
Dutch but retain physical markers of their Chinese heritage, which can lead to feelings of leading dual
lives due to the interplay of these two cultures. By looking at their personal experiences and
perceptions, insights can be given in how participants personally negotiate and cope with these
identity formations. The intersection of Dutch and Chinese identities, coupled with the physical
appearance mismatch, can create feelings of being different or out of place. Participants have shared
instances where they felt excluded, subjected to stereotypes and differential treatment based on their
heritage. Historical biases, stereotypes, and lack of representation in media can contribute to a sense
of not belonging. Amy, chairwoman of Asian Raisins, explains how this effects the second-generation:

```
‘’ What you see, is that a lot of people dissent from their Chinese part because it is weird or not
cool. It just isn’t seen as something positive, a lot of people in their youth want nothing more
than to have blond hair and blue eyes and have the name Piet, for example [...] you don’t see
any role models around you that look like you, I think it definitely influences how you shape
your identity.’’
```
In her function as chairwoman of Asian Raisins, Amy seeks to create awareness among the public about
the effects stereotyping has on second-generation Chinese and other South East Asian ethnicities in
the Netherlands. According to Amy, stereotypes are the basis for discrimination towards minority
groups. She thinks there is also a responsibility for the second-generation to confront the public
discourse and not become the stereotypes they observe. Therefore, I argue the importance of media
representation and how role models in media can support second-generation Chinese to shape their
identity. Parents may also function as role models, but may not suffice in the context of the host
society’s culture if participants wish to integrate. As Amy describes, because of stereotypes and lack
of role models, second-generation individuals do not want to look different than the dominant
appearance of the Dutch population. Especially during childhood I noticed participants were
confronted with this fact by other children. In order to create a better sense of belonging and increase
the acceptance of the host society, I wanted to explore how stereotypes and a lack of representation


```
Family and host society pressures
```
in mass media can be of influence. Among participants, a broader consciousness about stereotypes
could be observed, and some were aware that the Chinese diaspora has a responsibility in breaking
the common stereotypes of Chinese. Participant 8 imagines how staying in the Chinese community
only emphasizes existing stereotypes:

```
‘’If you live up to the stereotypes and don’t break free from it, you will keep them (the
stereotypes) [...] Our stereotype is our pitfall at the same time. People think you are intelligent
or good in math. There are minority groups that often have a harder time being accepted
compared to Asians.’’
```
Participant 8 feels a strong sense of belonging to the host society, but embraces her home culture. She
has a daughter and tries to pass on her home culture, but is also aware about the difficulty. Because
her husband is Dutch, she hopes to empower her daughter by raising her with the best from both
cultures and for that reason, does not want the Chinese diaspora to maintain current stereotypes. In
her quote, participant 8 was talking about family relations and the consequences it may have when
second-generation individuals take over their parents’ restaurants. She warns that staying in the
Chinese community and taking over parents’ restaurants will result in the preservation of certain
stereotypes. Nevertheless, she observes that the second-generation is doing well by analyzing the
career choices being made, which are often different than their parents and thus sees the potential to
break free from historical stereotypes.

It became clear that participant 8 believes that breaking the stigma of current stereotypes can lead to
broader acceptance towards Chinese in the Netherlands. I could also observe this from other
participants, where there was a tendency to lead the lives they imagine for themselves and therefore
move away from the stereotypical images. Especially when having children, they want to combine the
upbringing with Dutch and Chinese culture, consciously deciding what they believe is best from both
cultures. However, when stereotypes are closely linked to culture, these may still be confirmed
through the behavior of second-generation Chinese. Such as participant 15, admitting that she
confirms the stereotype that Chinese work hard by doing the same at her current occupation,
describing it as ‘’strong work ethics’’. Nevertheless, she hopes that the host society does not see her
as the stereotype but rather as the individual as she is. Participant 4 describes how he perceived
representation of Chinese in the media when growing up:


```
Family and host society pressures
```
```
‘’There were just no good Chinese role models and if there were, then it would always be
stereotypes. There were Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and that was it. There were just no role models
I could look up to.’’
```
I got in touch with participant 4 since he is the younger brother of an old classmate of mine in Chinese
school. We met in a quiet café in Amsterdam, where we could have a casual conversation before
starting the interview. We shared many similarities, such as the lack of role models while growing up
and having to go to Chinese school because our parents demanded so. Being raised in Amsterdam,
participant 4 was often surrounded with other cultures and therefore he thinks children did not pick
on him in school. However, due to the lack of Chinese representation in the media, he did not have
any role models to look up to which complicated the question of his identity. Media figures as role
models for children is even more important than real life acquaintances (Duck, 1990). This highlights
the relevance for this research even more and shows that influences from the host society reach to
such extent that media also plays a role. It signifies that identity formation of Chinese Dutch is complex,
because when participants cannot identify with role models in the media and rather only see
stereotypes, it becomes difficult for them to shape their own identity.

As participant 4 elaborates, he was rather confronted with stereotypes of Chinese and through these
portrayals, had to make sense of his own positioning in society since the stereotypes do not portray a
positive image of Chinese but often is portrayed in a belittling and befooling way. Consequently, it
becomes difficult to think of your own descent with pride and an aversion towards Chinese culture and
identity can be the result. In daily life, I notice the lack of media representation of Chinese myself and
can therefore understand the dilemma participant 4 was facing. Whilst growing up, I would then often
turn to Hong Kong media in order to find commonality. This was at times also stimulated by my parents,
since it was also the media they consumed. I noticed there were no role models for me in Chinese
media either, since none of them had an immigrant background.

In my research, I noticed participants would often refer to ‘’the Chinese community’’, entailing the
group of Chinese diaspora in the Netherlands. While there is no such thing as one Chinese community
in the Netherlands, participants would refer to this community in the light of other Chinese people
they know and this could also include their own kin. This group was also at times metaphorically
referred to as ‘’a bubble’’ because it was seen as something protective and secluded. With many
participants, I detected some sort of affiliations towards this community which might be best described
as a ‘’safe haven’’, a network where they can find belonging, recognition and support from others.
However, participants were able to recognize that holding close relation towards the Chinese


```
Family and host society pressures
```
community could complicate their integration. One insight from Oscar is shared, who hosts the Yang’s
Voices Podcast, aiming to give second-generation individuals a voice. His insight helps to understand
why some individuals maintain close contact with the Chinese community:

```
‘’Belonging, for me, is that you feel at home in the Netherlands in the broadest sense. That is
why I believe we (the second-generation) are not there yet. [...] some Chinese Dutch don’t feel
belonging in the bigger society and that is why they are forced go to the Chinese community,
to find their safe space.’’
```
From this angle, the complex position second-generation individuals can find themselves in becomes
apparent and an explanation is given why some prefer to stay close to the community. It shows that
feelings of not belonging can result in obstacles to integrate freely, and the less acceptance there is
from the host society, the more likely individuals seek refuge and are, albeit metaphorically, pushed
to their home culture. In the acculturation framework of Berry (1992), four strategies are proposed in
levels of acculturation. Within the separation strategy, individuals of a minority group remain close to
their home culture, without much interaction with the host society. In my research, I only detected
that participant 18 preferred the separation strategy. For all others, I noticed a strong preference to
integrate and participate in the host society to some degree. Based on my findings, I understand how
this can also be induced by factors of non-acceptance from the host society, resulting in the feeling of
non-belonging that Oscar refers to. I understand the argument from Oscar, since I recognize the feeling
of non-belonging in the host society. Sometimes, I am confronted with subtle instances where people
from the host society emphasize that I look different, such as approaching me in English instead of
Dutch. Or when being questioned if I eat dog meat, because some people have the illusion that all
people of Chinese descent do so. Being reminded of being different, it can be a salience for second-
generation Chinese Dutch to have a Chinese community where they are not confronted with these
instances. Nevertheless, other ethnic minorities face more serious acts of exclusion because of other
stereotypes. This is also supported by participant 7, explaining:

```
‘’Chinese often face micro aggressions. It is not such overt racism as you see with people of
Moroccan or Turkish descent.’’
```
In their research findings of experienced discrimination of East-Asian migrant groups in the
Netherlands, Broekroelofs & Poerwoatmodjo (2021) discovered that some of the participants of the
research group adopts different coping strategies, such as avoiding certain places and adaptation (try
to behave ‘’Dutch’’ and speak Dutch without an accent). Furthermore, they discovered that active


```
Family and host society pressures
```
confrontation against discrimination was only applied by second-generation individuals in their
research. A more extreme finding is that all of their participants are being confronted with negative
comments on a weekly to monthly basis. In my data collection, I found similarities on the ground of
the coping strategies, but by and large I did not detect discrimination on such high frequency.
Discrimination was most often experienced in their childhood. As participant 6 and participant 15
describe respectively:

```
‘’I was in a class with only white children. [...] yes, you would notice that directly. And besides,
children are just assholes, if I can say it like that. They bully you, especially when you look
different compared to the rest of the class. It made me an easy scapegoat.’’
```
```
About secondary school: ‘’It was an elite school, the whole school was white. For six years long
I was the only student with a migrant background. [...] So if you didn’t want to stand out, you’re
in bad luck, because you stand out for sure. [...] That was the first time I experienced
discrimination. I had to repeat that school year. That year was very tough and I really isolated
myself. I wasn’t claiming my spot, rather the opposite.’’
```
These recollections are told in retrospect but are still clear memories that participants were able to
describe in detail, showing their significance and the impact they had on their process of integration
and well-being. The argument of looking different plays a role that led to these experiences. This is one
of the challenges that second-generation individuals may face, no matter how well integrated, they
can always be confronted with the fact that they ‘’look different’’. I conducted the interview with
participant 6 at his work in Utrecht. He reserved a quiet office so we would not be disturbed. During
the interview, I noticed he experienced bullying at school and how this effected his perception on the
host society later in life. Fortunately, he is positive about his working environment which helped him
to accept his belonging in the host society. Participant 15 remembers how her primary school had
children of other cultural backgrounds, but how this was not the case in secondary school. She
described how students from her secondary school came from wealthy families and were raised more
intellectually, resulting in her feeling disadvantaged towards the rest. Participant 15 elaborated on
how she became an easy target as she not only looked different, but also had a different background.
She does not experience discrimination to this extent in her adult life, but it did complicate her identity
formation during adolescence. Participant 11 also faced difficulties in school because of his descent:


```
Family and host society pressures
```
```
‘’I can describe it better now, but I think I was not aware of it then that I was a target. And
because I watched martial arts movies, I picked up some moves so I was able to defend myself
[...] Yes, I literally had to defend myself.’’
```
Participant 11 shared his experiences in school in a casual manner, but the events show the severity
of the matter. Only through defending himself physically, he was able to show other children in school
he should be left in peace. Though he then did not realize he got in trouble because of his descent, he
can now analyze it better. He explained how he wanted to integrate by not spending too much time
with other second-generation Chinese, fearing this would influence his command of the Dutch
language. I became aware that participant 11 had the desire to integrate, but did not always know how
he could change the way he was perceived by the host society. He sometimes still faces discrimination
through jokes about his ethnicity and physique, but it does not bother him too much anymore. He
takes pride in his cultural background and is convinced that there will never be total acceptance from
the host society and supports this by arguing; ‘’we may be raised here, but we will always be different’’.
From my own experience, I never experienced such accounts of discrimination as participant 11 did
and therefore find it hard to relate to his arguments. However, I can imagine that when faced with
these confrontations, the perception of one’s identity becomes distanced to the host society, because
participant 11 clearly felt he was not accepted as an equal human being.

It is because of these events that explains why second-generation Chinese can still feel affiliated
towards the Chinese community. This in-betweenness can be the reason why participants identify with
both cultures and an assimilation strategy was only detected with participant 1, 9 and 14. Amon
participants, no signs of complete aversion towards the host society was detected and as mentioned
earlier, most significant forms of discrimination were experienced during childhood. I did observe
among participants that these past experiences created an awareness of their preferred surrounding,
meaning their everyday life at work and the place they choose to live. Participant 5 for example,
explained he prefers to live in a big city because he knows beforehand that in small villages, people are
less open minded towards Chinese. I thought it was remarkable that I question the stereotypes he was
facing, only to realize he also had clear prejudices towards the host society.

Participant 5 is an old colleague of mine. Because he is homosexual, I found it even more interesting
to include him in my list of participants since he once told me he had a difficult time to announce this
to his parents. Because his partner is also from Chinese descent, he believes living in an urban
environment suits them best. By avoiding to live in small villages, he tries to create an environment in
which he believes he faces the least amount of non-acceptance. A similar remark was made by


```
Family and host society pressures
```
participant 10, who prefers the multicultural neighborhood she lives in because it makes it easier for
her children to blend in, hoping they have an easier time navigating their own identity and belonging.
She believes that it would have been different for them if they were to live in a small village as she
experienced when she was growing up. When I was growing up, the number of children with an
immigrant background in my environment was minimal, and I think this increased the attention I got
because I looked different than other children. However, when studying in Amsterdam, this was
significantly less because of the multicultural environment. I therefore understand why participants
prefer to live in a more multicultural setting because it can be comforting to not be the only one with
an immigrant background.

I noticed most participants were confronted with non-acceptance during childhood. It is important to
mention that the Chinese diaspora in the Netherlands has a relative positive image among the Dutch
population. In comparison to other minorities such as Moroccans and Polish, the Chinese group is
viewed most positive (Gijsberts et al., 2011a, p. 162). This can best be understood through the lens of
‘’model minority’’, referring to ‘’ethnic minorities who are more likely to attain higher success in
academics, have a better economic advantage, family stability, and low crime involvement than other
minority groups’’ (Chou, 2008, as cited in (Lam & Vang, 2012, p. 1). It is a stereotype that was first
linked to Asian immigrant groups in the United States, suggesting they are ‘’homogenous, intelligent,
submissive to societal norms and emphasizes heavily in education and have been successful’’ (Lam &
Vang, 2012, p. 2), while Fong (2017) describes it as ‘’quiet, non-confrontational and respectful of
authority’’. According to Rijkschroeff (1998, p. 204), the phenomenon of model minority developed
around the 1960s in order to describe Chinese-Americans, but he is concerned with the social issues
concerning Chinese immigrants, such as discrimination, insufficient language proficiency and lack in
education and skills. However, he emphasizes the distinction between the first- and second-
generation, where the second-generation has overcome these issues to a large degree. Despite this, I
still discovered a strong preference to avoid conflict. Through this behavior and the model minority
stereotype, Chinese immigrants become an easy scapegoat in the host society.

Discrimination in later stages of participants’ lives was often not prevalent. Arguments for this could
be the aforementioned surrounding they place themselves in, but it also has to do about integration
and adaptation to the Dutch environment. Participant 11 tells that ‘’the second-generation has been
able to make so many steps because a lot of Chinese step out of their bubble. So I think the surrounding
you place yourself in is an important factor’’. However, it is never a given that discrimination does not
take place when integrated well. To illustrate, participant 11 first mentioned he did not experience
discrimination any longer, only some jokes about his descent occasionally. When I explained that


```
Family and host society pressures
```
discrimination can also be manifested through jokes, he only then realized he was still being
confronted with discrimination. Minimizing the impact and happening of these events can be related
to their upbringing, where participants were taught to be non-confrontational and remain in the
background. Nevertheless, the instances where participants were confronted with their ethnic and
cultural background can best be described as ‘’othering’’, where the ‘’foundation is constructed on the
imbalance of power, as with much in the realm of oppressive and discriminatory behaviors. Essentially,
‘’ohtering’’ can be understood as a social method of identifying individuals thought to be different
from one’s self or culture [...] which creates an atmosphere of ‘us’ versus ‘them’’’ (Epps & Furman,
2016). Through ‘’othering’’, people with an immigrant background have a hard time finding belonging
and total acceptance in the host society. Participants would face this kind of ‘’othering’’ often in the
form of comments from strangers. As participant 1, participant 9 and participant 13 describe
respectively:

```
When being seen as Chinese: ‘’That’s interesting that people see me as such and count me in
as a Chinese person, while I don’t see myself as such [...] at some point you kind of get used to
it, which is also fucked, but that is how it goes.’’
```
_‘’Every now and then when I’m cycling, I hear; ‘hey, poepchinees’, or that sort of things.’’_

```
‘’Sometimes there’s Dutch kids walking by, saying; ‘ching chang chong’. But only kids do this,
adults don’t.’’
```
As seen from these instances, ‘’othering’’ happens through comments and remarks participants hear
from strangers. Participant 13, for example, is confronted by ‘’othering’’ from children. Participant 2
finds a correlation between integration and the amount of ‘’othering’’ one can face:

```
‘’I think it is about the command of the Dutch language [...] it could be that people think; ‘oh,
it’s a Chinese customer’. But then I talk back and then I also see from their expression and the
way they reply; ‘oke, it’s a local.’’’
```
This is similar to the findings from Broekroelofsen & Poerwoatmodjo (2021), where participants
overcompensate by behaving in an exemplary manner and speak Dutch without an accent in order to
show they are well integrated. By integrating, participants believe they do not have to face
discriminatory experiences any longer. Participant 2 elaborates that it is because he likes to conform
himself to the society, and therefore he is friendly and helpful towards others. In his philosophy, I see


```
Family and host society pressures
```
similarities in the description of the ‘’model minority’’. I understand the willingness to conform to the
model minority, because it is not the worst position to have in a society. However, when faced with
these examples of ‘’othering’’ and the second-generation accepts this without confronting the host
society, it is likely to reoccur in the future. More inclusive experiences were also reported. For example,
participant 4 is often asked to model for photoshoots from his employer, where his photos are being
used on the company webpage in order to show they adopt an inclusive policy.

### 4.4 Conclusion

In this chapter, I investigated the impact of tiger parenting on participants' integration experiences.
Tiger parenting, characterized by strict emphasis on academic success, places immense pressure on
individuals, potentially harming their self-esteem and hindering social integration. My data
demonstrates that participants raised under tiger parenting often struggle with social integration due
to its high focus on academic achievements. I discovered that parental attitudes toward integration,
such as prioritizing cultural education over social interactions, further affect participants' ability to
integrate into Dutch society. Furthermore, occasions of domestic violence was observed, revealing that
resistance from second-generation individuals is limited due to the authoritative nature of tiger
parenting. The upbringing of the second generation, emphasizing conflict avoidance and collectivism,
also contributes to this response. Participants look at their own and fellow second-generation
integration process as a success, but different meanings were given on the definition of integration. A
distinction must be made, that participants wish to integrate, but not assimilate into the host society.
They value their home culture and see a benefit in maintaining affiliation to both cultures. By fitting
the profile of the ‘’model minority’’, the second-generation tries to be part of society in a conforming
way. However, the stereotype of model minority is also a barrier for complete acceptance and
integration, leaving the second-generation with continuous negotiation with one’s own identity and
belonging. This makes the Chinese diaspora an easy scapegoat, as the Chinese culture entails avoiding
conflict and maintain harmony.

In the remainder of this chapter, I have presented the pressures participants face from the host society.
This is manifested in several ways, such as stereotyping, ‘’othering’’ and discrimination.
Underrepresentation in mass media is evident due to the absence of role models during their
childhood, which may lead to lower self-esteem among second-generation individuals. Constant
reminders emphasizing their difference compared to the general Dutch population can serve as a
pushing factor for the second-generation to seek refuge and support from the Chinese community.
Discrimination was experienced more often in school as a child, participants are now rather victims of


```
Family and host society pressures
```
‘’othering’’, which is expressed by strangers through negative comments or jokes. As participants do
not want to cause trouble, they do not speak up to defend themselves. Rather, an adaptative strategy
is applied where compliance is sought by behaving accordingly and speaking Dutch without an accent.
Instead of facing direct confrontation, their preferred strategy is to avoid trouble, which is also seen in
the environment they place themselves in. For example, by staying in a multicultural and urban
environment, the general thought is that there is more acceptance towards them.

‘’A dog being raised by lions, is still a dog. It does not suddenly become a lion.’’

- Participant 11

The illustration shows the fictional character Tarzan being surrounded by gorillas, a species he grew
up with but soon is confronted with the fact that he is different from them.


```

```
### 5.1 Introduction

The quote from the previous page is from participant 11 and upon analyzing, it reminded me of the
tale of Tarzan as I could detect resemblance. As Tarzan is raised by gorillas in the jungle, he behaves as
such, since there is no human interaction. Though he is aware that he physically looks different than
the others, it is the only reality he knows. Other apes think he is an odd one and treat him differently.
A more prominent identity crisis develops when he meets Jane, falls in love and comes in touch with
civilization. Similar to second-generation Chinese, Tarzan is eager to discover his identity and
belonging. When applying participant 11’s thought to the tale of Tarzan, participant 11 would argue
Tarzan can never be a gorilla since he is born as a human.

As the first chapter was focused on integration, this chapter explores how participants navigate their
identity and belonging. Results from the previous chapter are used in order to show how it has
impacted identity formation and the sense of belonging. Identity is presented from the participants’
perspective, and therefore is focused on their perception of being. However, one identity discussed is
the ascribed identity, which concerns from the perspective of how others perceive and identify the
researched group. This is done through detailed analysis of the data, where I highlighted important
events on how participants were treated by other people. It is an identity that I present based on my
own analyses, and not based on what participants self-identified with. As a result, I discuss five types
of identities; hybrid identity, Dutch identity, Chinese identity, non-nation identity and ascribed
identity. These are identities I discovered that were the most prominent throughout the scope of my
participants, and admittedly not all of them were anticipated on throughout my literature review.
Particularly the non-nation identity and ascribed identity became prominent when I was conducting
my research. Nevertheless, I believe these types of identities can be found within other second-
generation immigrant groups in the Netherlands, where the Chinese identity would then be replaced
with another home culture. However, I am uncertain which identities will be most prevalent within
other groups. As I argue in this chapter, second-generation Chinese conform to a large extent to the
model minority stereotype. For most other immigrant groups, this stereotype is not applicable. For
example, my participants did not feel marginalized by the host society, something that might be more
prevalent among other ethnic groups.

Belonging is discussed at the end of the chapter. Along this topic, I will also include examples of non-
belonging, referring to moments where participants felt they did not belong to a certain group or place.
The phenomenon of non-belonging works antagonist to belonging, because it focuses on moments,
places or groups where participants did not feel a sense of belonging. It can help to understand the


```
Identity and belonging
```
complete picture of an individual’s sense of belonging. Identity and belonging are concepts that are
included in all three sub questions. It will share most relevance to the first sub question, as the
information of the previous chapter is utilized in order to come to an understanding of participants’
identity and belonging.

### 5.2 Hybrid identity

Immigrants’ identities have various concepts describing the bicultural exposures they experience, such
as dual identity (Fleischmann & Verkuyten, 2016), multiple identification (Verkuyten et al., 2019) or
hyphenated identities (Bélanger & Verkuyten, 2010). However, ‘’the concept of hybridity emphasizes
how subsequent migrant generations are often adept at mixing and borrowing cultural beliefs and
practices’’ (Raffaetà et al., 2016, p. 423). And as Raffaetà et al. continue, this hybridity is employed
strategically. From all these different concepts, hybrid identity is the most appropriate term to use,
since it also implies a certain amount of fluidity (Day & Badou, 2019). Participants who identified with
a hybrid identity looked at their identity formation as a process and something that is not fixed. I
believe this is due to the fact that there is attachment towards both cultures, but also an amount of
indecisiveness that can play a role. As I experience myself, I prefer to self-identify as hybrid, since I
remain with the question what my identity is. By being hybrid, I do not exclude one culture over the
other.

When perceiving identity as a process, age can also be of importance, where adolescence is known for
intense identity exploration (Kidwell & Dunham, 1995). For example, 46 year old participant 10
acknowledged her identity exploration was more at ease the older she gets. On the contrary, 18 year
old participant 1 was more inconsistent in her identity, sharing that she feels less Dutch now compared
to last year. I am acquainted with participant 1 because we are both member of the same climbing and
mountaineering association in Wageningen. We got to sit outdoors whilst conducting the interview,
making it a pleasant environment as it was my first interview. While she grew up, she was in close
contact with the Chinese community because of her parents, which included going to Chinese school
and playing with other children with a Chinese descent. However, as she reached adulthood and
moved to Wageningen to study, she started to identify more as Dutch. Currently, she self-identifies
predominantly as Dutch rather than Chinese, but she still finds herself doubting from time to time
when she realizes she has characteristics of Chinese culture in her behavior.

With many participants, I tried asking them to ascribe a percentage to their Chinese and Dutch
identities. It was a direct question and participants did not always have a prompt answer ready, but it


```
Identity and belonging
```
allowed for them to pinpoint to which culture they feel more attached to. In quite some instances,
participants said ‘’50/50’’ as an answer, which can best be described as the hybrid identity they like to
place themselves in. As participant 5, 10 and 17 describe respectively:

```
‘’I find it hard to give it a ratio, but I think I’m half half and I can adapt to it whenever it suits
me [...] I don’t have to exclusively choose the Dutch culture or the Chinese culture. I can combine
it.’’
```
```
‘’Now I am 46 years old I notice I am more at ease [...] I am who I am, half half, and I think there
are plenty of others just like me. So I don’t want to choose one over the other.’’
```
```
‘’I think my identity is 50/50, and I can be flexible in it.’’
```
Before moving to Utrecht, participant 5 lived in Rotterdam where he had many friends from Chinese
descent. When he moved to Utrecht, he realized the population in the city was not that diverse as in
Rotterdam. He had to adjust his Chinese identity more towards his Dutch identity, also because he has
many Dutch colleagues at work. He tries to combine both cultures and adapt to the situation at hand.
For that reason, he describes his identity as both Chinese and Dutch. He does not want to exclude one
identity from the other, because he finds strength in being both. I could see this was a practical
example when hybrid identities are being deployed, and he found strength in his hybridity at work. If
he would be confronted by his colleagues about his ethnic background, he shrugs it off and can make
a joke about it. I could tell this would position him partly in a victim role, but by joking about it, he is
able to balance this towards a nice relationship with his colleagues. He admitted his colleagues know
clearly what is acceptable to say about his ethnic background and to what extent it is appreciated to
make jokes about it, and I could tell this was a pleasant environment for him to work in.

Hybrid identities have a fluidity that is not fixed. Second-generation immigrants are exposed to two
cultures and participants know how to utilize both in order to achieve the best results. Similar to a
chameleon, they adapt to their surroundings. Whenever they are with Dutch colleagues for example,
they utilize their Dutch identity. And when they are amongst family, their Chinese identity is more
prevalent. This hybrid identity is also used abroad. Some participants used their Chinese identity when
they visit China, and in this sense adapt their behavior more to local customs. Participant 6 saw his
identity in a larger perspective and said his double nationality allowed him to legally be in other places
in the world and was aware that this could be of influence how people would treat him based on his
nationality. Participant 17 would for instance prefer to identify as Chinese on vacation when she sees


```
Identity and belonging
```
Dutch tourists behaving in extravagant manners. She also prefers her Chinese identity during social
gatherings, where food is more central. She is happy that she can offer her children both perspectives,
but is shocked to realize she sometimes copies her parents’ behavior in parenting. Through constant
reflection, she hopes to redefine her hybrid identity. Though shaped and influenced by many factors,
it is clear that identity has a personal part and is partly acquired by the individual in question.

As described in the conceptual framework, pressure to assimilate can be a discourse and perceived as
such by people with an immigrant background. This pressure is shared by participants, but they did
not recognize this has made them to assimilate. Participants with a hybrid identity wanted to remain
hybrid but also acknowledged it would be subject to shift to the Dutch culture. The reason for this is
due to their surroundings and exposure to Dutch culture. They see it more as something natural that
occurs since this is the flexibility that defines hybridity. Furthermore, participants were able to talk
about their identity as it was something they claimed. Their whole lives, they had to navigate between
two cultures. As adults, there now is the common believe that it is only righteous that they can choose
their own identity. By acquiring one’s identity, I could tell a large process beforehand has taken place.

Through the concept of identification (Kartosen, 2016), three cross-cutting aspects are included: 1)
self-categorization, 2) perception of commonality and 3) feelings of belonging. In all cases, self-
categorization implied an active choice in which group participants want to place them in. For hybrid
identities, individuals seek to be associated with both cultures and therefore categorize themselves in
both groups. Perception of commonality is closely related to self-categorization. ‘’An individual can
perceive the self as sharing distinct attributes with another person or group. This requires an individual
to see the self in others’’ (Kartosen). From hybrid identities, this is explained through different
surroundings participants engage themselves in. They are in close contact with Dutch and Chinese
cultures, and therefore see a perception in commonality in both of them. Kartosen’s third cross-cutting
aspect on belonging is discussed at the end of this chapter. In relation to Berry’s acculturation
framework, the hybrid identity fits well in the integration strategy since both cultures are given
meaning and coexist along each other.

### 5.3 Dutch identity

From participant 1, 9 and 14, strong affiliations were measured towards a Dutch identity. Relating this
to Berry’s acculturation framework, they would be positioned at the assimilation strategy. However,
as they assimilated, it does not mean they had negative connotations towards Chinese culture. They
still had meaningful family relations and participant 1 and 14 are still proficient in speaking Chinese.


```
Identity and belonging
```
Amoong all three participants, besides of family, there were no other Chinese in their network, which
can also be the reason why there is no affiliation with Chinese culture. And as participant 14 describes:

```
‘’I really was raised like a kaaskop, knowing that I had dark hair. But I had blond hair, blue hair,
all sorts of colors as a teenager. I’ve never felt different. It was an eyeopener for me there in
Hong Kong that I really did not belong there, and I was grateful to be where I’m from.’’
```
Participant 14 was raised being the youngest of her two siblings whom were born and partly raised in
Hong Kong, but she was born in Breda. After living in Asia for 14 years, she has now remigrated to the
Netherlands and runs a modern restaurant and convenience store with her spouse. I was invited to
their restaurant for conducting the interview. While I was waiting, participant 14 was occupied with
helping customers, and I got the feeling people from the neighborhood thought of the place like a
community center where you could come to have an informal chat with your friends. It was a pleasant
environment and I could see participant 14 enjoyed being a host and small talking with her customers.
When conducting the interview, we sat outside where she shared many details on her identity and
belonging. She described how she had a much easier childhood being the youngest, as she did not have
to help in her parents’ restaurant like her older siblings. Also, high parental expectations were absent
and she was free to develop her own identity. There was no tiger parenting, focusing on high academic
achievements and controlling behavior from her parents. Lastly, I did not detect any non-acceptance
she experienced from the host society. Participant 1 and 9 experienced the same sort of upbringing,
both being the youngest at home and a lot of freedom to develop one’s own identity. The Dutch
identity of participant 14 was only reaffirmed when she went to Hong Kong for the first time at age 20.
She recollects the following:

```
‘’My parents did not return for 30 years, for me it was the first time and we all thought it was
terrible. We all had a culture shock, my mother had skin allergies and couldn’t stand the warm
climate. I thought everything was terrible, it was too crowded, too chaotic [...] I saw old people
begging on the street, old grannies cleaning tables at the McDonalds and I had a difficult time
seeing this. It was a nasty society and maybe that’s why I pushed my descent away.’’
```
Later in her life, she lived in Hong Kong and other Asian countries for a total of 14 years. When asked
if this did not ignite a part of her Chinese identity, she explained it was the opposite. The longer she
lived in Asia, the more she embraced her Dutch identity. Of all the Asian countries she has lived in, she
thought Hong Kong was the worst. Only after meeting her Swiss husband who embraces Chinese
culture more than she does, she became less resistant to her descent. Kartosen’s (2016) concept of


```
Identity and belonging
```
identification can be applied again in order to understand her identification process. As self-
categorization, she categorizes herself with the Dutch identity. This is her free choice, but decides that
this suits her more. In her perception of commonality, she did not find much commonality with the
local population in Hong Kong. As a result, she would actively look for Dutch people. When growing
up, she did not have any contact with other Chinese besides her family. She found commonality with
the Dutch people and also used to color her hair in order to look less Chinese.

Participant 9 has always identified as Dutch, but he has had questions in his life and sought answers.
As he describes his identity and process:

```
‘’Currently, Dutch. It never has been different but I have wondered where I am actually from
[...] I made a trip to China alone. It was amazing, but there I came to the conclusion, I am also
not Chinese besides my looks. This trip is what really shaped me. Yes, I have the right to that
opinion, but practically speaking, I’m Dutch. This was my journey to came to that realization.’’
```
Because he does not speak Chinese, he argued he was not able to find perception of commonality
when he traveled to China. He did enjoy it to be surrounded by people who physically have similar
features, but could not find a connection with them and therefore does not self-categorize as such. As
a child, he lived in Curaçao for a couple of years. Looking back, he thought of himself as a Dutch person,
temporarily migrating to Curaçao. He believes his Dutch identity is shaped because he was surrounded
by a lot of Dutch people when growing up. Though he has a lot of relatives, there never was any
pressure to remain affiliated to Chinese culture. Because he was raised with a lot of freedom, he also
did not inherit many cultural beliefs from them. His parents had a good command of the Dutch
language and therefore only Dutch was spoken at home. His parents never shared much about the
family history and their reasons to migrate. This, eventually, led to his own journey to China with the
aim to explore his own ethnic background. During his travels, he came to the conclusion he is not
Chinese and he can now confirm his Dutch identity. After the interview, he remembered a few facets
that he incorporated from his upbringing that can be traced back to his home culture. Firstly, he values
food and the culture around it and sees it as something that is shared with people around him.
Secondly, he values close family relations, an example is his mother-in-law living with him. Lastly, he
found respect towards people who are senior to you important and expects from his children to be
compliant to his authority in the way he had to do so too when growing up.

Participant 1 was raised with more Chinese culture around her, had to go to Chinese school and her
parents were close to the Chinese community. Later in her upbringing, she did not experience strict


```
Identity and belonging
```
parenting and besides from her direct family, was not in much contact with others from the Chinese
community. She explains how she sometimes questions her Dutch identity:

```
‘’I did not realize there was such a strong Dutch culture, like eating a cheese sandwich for lunch.
I sometimes do it, but I still prefer to have warm meals for lunch. Maybe I’m not that Dutch as
I think I was [...] I think I’ll only feel more Dutch because I live here and have my life here.’’
```
Even though she identifies as Dutch, participant 1 admits she sometimes feels guilty she does not
maintain her command of Chinese language. Similar to participant 9, she gives a lot of meaning to food
and in that regard, questions her Dutch identity sometimes. However, as the majority of her relatives
live in China, she never established a close relationship with them. Over the years, her mother became
more oriented towards Dutch culture and identity, and this might also explain the meanings participant
1 gives to her Dutch identity. Some similarities between participants 1, 9 and 14 are pronounced, such
as the lack of connection with other Chinese when growing up. It is not that they had an aversion
towards people of Chinese descent, but they simply were not there in their surroundings. Furthermore,
I noticed they were always the youngest in the household and did not face major parental
expectations. Lastly, they did not experience serious acts of discrimination, and therefore pressures
from the host society were low. I was also the youngest in the household when growing up, and I can
confirm I enjoyed an easier upbringing than my older brother. He had to endure the highest
expectations, and to some extent it was expected that he would watch over me. I can imagine how
being the youngest in the household can result in lower affection towards the home culture, since
there is less demand from parents to do so. This liberty is what gave participants 1, 9 and 14 the
opportunity to explore their own identity as they wished and since they were dominantly surrounded
by influences from the host society, they adapted their identity accordingly.

### 5.4 Chinese identity

Throughout all participants, there were two participants who identified as predominantly Chinese.
Since 2019, participant 18 has been living in Beijing, China. His motivation was to discover if he could
find more connection to the Chinese culture and migrated to China to start his bachelor program. In
his first month, he was mainly observing the interaction and language used among students. Because
he learned Mandarin Chinese from his parents, it was a different application of language when
communicating with fellow students. After a month of observing, he engaged more with students and
through this strategy, evolved his own command of Mandarin Chinese. After spending four years in
China he now identifies as Chinese. I noticed he introduced himself with his Dutch and Chinese name,


```
Identity and belonging
```
signifying the meaning he gave to his Chinese identity. He elaborated on it by admitting he is redefining
his own identity, and since he is feeling predominantly Chinese, prefers to include his Chinese name at
introductions. All second-generation Chinese Dutch I know have a Western/English first name,
followed with their Chinese name. Commonly, the Chinese name is not used in the host society. By
introducing himself with his Chinese name, participant 18 is consciously tapping into the Chinese
identity he was ascribed to at birth already.

Participant 18 is the older brother of participant 1. After interviewing participant 1, she suggested to
introduce her brother to participate in my research. While participant 1 identifies as Dutch, her brother
is the opposite. Participant 18 emphasizes that it was a voluntarily choice to live in China, and did not
experience major push factors from the host society. He explains how he was closely raised with the
Chinese community, with Chinese culture and practices, and how he felt closely connected to it. His
upbringing is similar to participant 1, but as the older brother, I detected he had more responsibilities.
For example, when their parents discovered his command of the Dutch language was lacking behind
in school, he was only allowed to speak Dutch with her younger sister so that she would be better
prepared prior to entering school. His parents expected him to do well in school, but he did not have
a hard time meeting these demands as he never had to put much effort in studying. I noticed how he
made a deliberate consideration of both Chinese and Dutch culture, and how he chose to explore the
Chinese culture because he felt more connection to it. It also came to my attention that he had no
negative experiences throughout his upbringing because he could easily meet his parents’
expectations. It is in a complete different perspective than for example participant 2, who experienced
his upbringing in a much more negative way. Participant 18 however, informed me he did not have
negative experiences from his parents’ upbringing or from the host society.

In the acculturation framework of Berry, participant 18 has adopted the ‘’separation strategy’’, since
the choice has been made to stay close to the home culture and move away from the host society. As
Berry describes (1992), the separation strategy has a positive and a negative side, because there is
preference for one culture over the other. Nevertheless, participant 18 still finds occasions where he
can apply a more ‘’Dutch approach’’ in some social settings. He does this by ‘’being stubborn’’, meaning
that in a discussion he can choose to hold tight to his arguments instead of pleasing others. In Chinese
culture, it is generally more accepted to find consensus but by adopting a bit of stubbornness, he can
move a discussion to his side without being too rude. Nevertheless, he never longs for connection to
other Dutch people and admits he might even try to avoid them. As he has acquired the Chinese culture
throughout the past four years, he identifies as such and finds most comfort among Chinese. When
asked if he experienced a culture shock, he recalls he only experienced this when revisiting the


```
Identity and belonging
```
Netherlands after spending a period of two years in China. He recollects that he arrived at the customs
in the airport, and forgot how to greet in Dutch. He was amazed at how he had assimilated to the
Chinese culture and was astounded to realize that he had forgotten how to speak Dutch for a moment.
I discovered that from the perspective of Berry’s acculturation framework, he fits within the separation
strategy. However, looking from the perspective of acculturation towards Chinese culture, he has
adopted the ‘’assimilation strategy’’ for he has abandoned the Dutch culture and has fully submerged
himself in Chinese culture.

While integrating, participant 18 never experienced negative responses in China. Fellow students were
rather curious about his background and so far has had a positive experience connecting with his home
culture. His father remigrated to China, and he has many opportunities to visit his father and relatives
during vacations. During the past four years, participant 18 has been able to build a solid transnational
network, and will start his master degree this year. He realizes China is a big country, and sees a large
difference between Beijing and his father’s place of residence. He does feel a strong sense of belonging
whenever he visits his father and relatives, but has an open attitude towards opportunities that can
arise in the future. Compared to other participants, I discovered participant 18 has the strongest
abilities to live and adapt in two cultures. Even though he identifies more with one than the other, he
has experienced both and can easily acculturate to both.

Participant 11 self-identifies as Chinese/Hong Kongese. As he describes it:

```
‘’I don’t have many Chinese friends, but it’s in my blood and genes, I’m fully Chinese. I was
raised very traditionally as Chinese Hong Kongese. That’s just how I feel. [...] We may be raised
here, but we’ll always be different.’’
```
As I was conducting the interview, participant 11 stroke me as a well-integrated individual. He talked
about integration as a crucial aspect of the second-generation. It therefore somehow surprised me
that he self-identifies as Chinese. He gave much meaning to his upbringing and mentioned several
times he was ‘’raised traditionally’’. I noticed he encountered numerous examples of ‘’othering’’
behavior in his life, though it has become less in adulthood. The case of participant 11 shows the long
lasting impact ‘’othering’’ can have on one’s perception of self-identification. He does not think he is
the only one who’s different, he talks about the whole second-generation Chinese Dutch in his quote.
Later in the interview, it became more obvious why he identifies as such through examples he gave.
To illustrate, he was raised in a strict manner where domestic violence occurred. He does not
completely discard this upbringing, since it has shaped him to be the person he is today. If he were to


```
Identity and belonging
```
be a parent, he admitted to incorporate notions of domestic violence too. He believes domestic
violence can be important to teach children the boundaries of what is allowed. Another example is his
way of thinking, where he acknowledged to apply Chinese working culture and ethics. I understand
what he means with Chinese working ethics, which is characterized with respect to authority and hard
work. However, only after my data analysis I can relate the experiences of participant 10, 13 and 14,
who all have lived and worked in China for a period of time. All of them were horrified by the working
culture, while all of their parents used to have Chinese restaurants and are somewhat familiar with
Chinese working ethics from home. I therefore am uncertain how ‘’Chinese’’ participant 11’s actual
working mentality is, and if it’s not been adapted towards Dutch culture unconsciously.

Nevertheless, his self-identification is a reminder of an individual’s ability to acquire an identity. It
demonstrates the importance of Brubaker’s (2002, p. 174) argument that identities ‘’exist only in and
through our perceptions, interpretations, representations, categorizations and identifications. They
are not things in the world, but perspectives on the world’’. It is a claim he makes on his perception of
self, where I noticed he takes pride in his cultural background. His frame of reference for the home
culture is inherited from his parents through his upbringing. Through his own understanding of the
culture, he identifies and also prefers to behave as such. I understand his self-identification, because
the physical markers of his ethnic background distinguish him from the general population.
Additionally, I recognize his belief that he will ‘’always be different’’. This ongoing process of
negotiation and adaptation is integral to the quest for one’s societal belonging. The sentiment of being
set apart becomes particularly pronounced when individuals encounter instances of discrimination.
The non-acceptance participant 11 experiences ultimately leads him to algin more closely with his
traditional upbringing, which he is most familiar with.

### 5.5 Non-nation identity

When starting my research, I was focused on exploring identities within the scope of cultural and ethnic
identities. This was also my approach during the interviews, but was surprised when participants 7 and
15 did not identify with either and preferred to position their identities in a more personal manner.
Participant 7 likes to think of her identity as:

```
‘’Not in the context of nationality or ethnicity, honestly. This is probably because I was part of
a group in my student years and none of them were really occupied with this topic. [...] I think
my identity is mostly subcultural and I identify most with alternative left-wing oriented people.’’
```

```
Identity and belonging
```
I met participant 7 through a friend who asked around in her network for possible participants. For
participant 7, her time as a student shaped her identity most, where she developed affiliations with
subcultures. Being aware that she is Dutch in her behavior, she does not want to identify with a
national culture. This can be explained through her social network, where her friends often do not give
meaning to national identities. Rather, she likes to identify among subcultures, since her ethnicity is
not of importance. For logistical purposes, I conducted the interview with participant 7 through
Microsoft Teams, but nevertheless she was very open to share her identity formation. She explained
how she always had an interest in arts. She did not receive support from her parents and therefore
chose not to study arts. This was different with her younger sister, whom did receive support and
eventually started to study arts. Nevertheless, participant 7 found a study that suited her interest and
it was during this period that she found a network of people where she felt a sense of belonging,
described by her as ‘’alternative subculture, focused on alternative music, and a bit activistic’’. She
knows she has notions of Dutch and Chinese culture, but does not recognize herself as such.

Participant 15 had a different reasoning for her non-nation identity. She explained how she
experienced her adolescence and how this has impacted her identity formation:

```
‘’When I’m among Dutch people, I feel Chinese. But when I’m among Chinese people, I feel
Dutch. So I didn’t fit into any group. I could not identify myself as Chinese among Chinese, and
among Dutch people, it was obvious I am not Dutch. Now, I am who I am and that is not defined
as Chinese or Dutch.’’
```
At age 39, she reflects on her identity formation and was aware it has been an extensive process for
her. Through constant negotiation and redefining of her identity, she has now come to the conclusion
she belongs in the Netherlands, but does not want to identify with a national or ethnic identity.
Through her extensive process, I could observe it is an identity she has acquired for herself, but it can
also be seen as an ascribed identity. Because she has experienced moments of ‘’othering’’ and non-
belonging, she has a hard time to identify with either the home culture or the host society’s. During
her visit to Hong Kong, she came to the conclusion she does not belong there either, as she has
acculturated to the Dutch culture and had a difficult time communicating with the local population.
She is not surprised that she is confronted with identity negotiations as she questions the
‘’Chineseness’’ of her parents. After living in the Netherlands for several decades, she thinks her
parents’ command of Chinese language has also decreased and they have acculturated to Dutch
culture significantly. She believes they experienced the most severe ‘’cultural conflict’’ as first-


```
Identity and belonging
```
generation immigrants and this has influenced her upbringing, automatically inheriting the challenges
of living in two cultures.

In the examples of participant 7 and 15, I noticed they were content with their self-identification.
However, when applying Kartosen’s concept of identification (2016), the ‘’perception of commonality’’
is hard to assess in their cases. Neither of the participants felt a strong enough connection to either
their home culture or the host society, thus prefer not to identify with either. It is an identity they have
acquired for themselves, but at the same has been shaped by how their identity has been ascribed by
others, meaning the non-belonging, low level of acceptance and low perception of commonality
experienced. At first, I was surprised to come across this description of self-identification in my results,
but after thorough analysis it makes sense. I noticed how their affection towards both the home
culture and host society was neutral, which explains why they do not identify with either. By not
identifying with a culture, they have the liberty to be who they want to be, free of expectations to
behave according to a specific culture. It is a phenomenon that can occur among second-generation
individuals, as they find themselves in a bicultural environment.

When I try to assess their identity with Berry’s acculturation framework (1997), they would fit into the
marginalization strategy. According to Berry et al. (2017), marginalized individuals ‘’have the poorest
outcomes, the lowest levels of life satisfaction and mental health, as well as social, economic and
educational attainment and wellbeing’’. The marginalized strategy refers to low identification and
belonging towards both host society and home culture. My results do not show such extremes, and it
must be emphasized that both participants were content and satisfied with their position in society.
Also, the marginalized strategy assumes a low sense of belonging. However, in my research, both
participants felt they do have a strong sense of belonging to the host society, but do not identify as
such. To describe them as marginalized does not do justice on their individual journey towards their
identity, focuses too much on identity being ascribed by others and does not accentuate the voluntary
basis of their own acquired identity.

### 5.6 Ascribed identity....................................................................................................................

During my research, I discovered another form of identity. The ascribed identity was not recognized
openly by my participants, but I could detect past events in their social surroundings were of great
influence on their identity formation. Ascribed identity is when ‘’others disregard the achieved identity
and continue to assign an identity through recognition to that individual’’ (Palmer, 2007). The achieved
identity has formerly been discussed as the ‘’acquired identity’’, which is the identity individuals desire


```
Identity and belonging
```
to be, seek recognition for and claim to. Parental expectations, as discussed in the previous chapter,
were at times demanding on the course of participants’ lives. For example, when participant 7
announced to her parents she wanted to study arts, she did not receive any support and was urged to
study something else. As I recognize, Chinese parents think of studying as a way to become financially
secure later in life. Participant 7 eventually chose a different study, while her younger sister later did
get support to study arts. It shows a significant life choice has been made based on how her parents
expected her life should be. A more extreme example is from participant 16, who describes:

```
‘’Best example is music education, it was always a requirement at home. It was a requirement
to play certain music from a young age. I studied at the conservatory, but that was not my free
will.’’
```
His parents expected him to become a successful musician and dictated him to pursue a degree at the
conservatory, while his desire was to study something else. Participant 16 explained how he did not
want to become a musician, but nevertheless still finished his degree to satisfy his parents. For the
host society, the Chinese diaspora may be seen as the successful model minority because of their high
socio-economic status, which is another form of an ascribed identity. Especially looking at the second-
generation Chinese Dutch, few are unemployed while many have studied a university degree and
obtain a high position occupation (Gijsberts et al., 2011b). However, after interviewing participants, I
discovered this ‘’success’’ comes with great pressure. In the case of participant 16, he did not want to
become a musician and later started a second bachelor program. It was his way to shape his own
identity, but surprisingly he never confronted his parents that he resented the conservatory. Academic
achievements hold a high priority for tiger parents, and therefore most participants had to go to
Chinese school on Saturdays. This is also a form of ascribing the Chinese identity to the second-
generation, as they are required to inherit the culture. Through this strict parenting, many participants
acknowledged they (would) raise their own children differently.

Ascribed identity generally also happens from the host society, such as the aforementioned model
minority. As the name of model minority already implies, the immigrant group is the minority
compared to the dominant host society. I believe the phenomenon of the model minority distinguishes
the Chinese diaspora from other immigrant groups, because it is a stereotype that impacts my research
group in a specific way. For example, being a model minority may result in a lack of attention towards
this minority group, since the public’s perception is that there are no social issues to be addressed. As
an outcome, it can be a forgotten group in policymaking and excluded from society (van Veen, 1999).


```
Identity and belonging
```
In the Netherlands, most research on identity formation of immigrant groups and its second-
generations are focused on people from post-colonial territories (Bosma, 2012; Khusen, 2005;
Verkuyten & Brug, 2002), Turkish (Vedder & Virta, 2005; Verkuyten, 1990) and Moroccan descent
(Essers & Benschop, 2007; Ketner et al., 2004), which are the three largest immigrant groups in the
Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2016). One distinguishing factor between these
groups and the Chinese diaspora lies in the primary reasons for their migration to the host society.
They were often motivated by (post-)colonial relationships or government-initiated labor migration.
Consequently, these circumstances resulted to other specific stereotypes. For instance, _‘’de
schoonmaakturk’’_ (the cleaning Turk) to describe people of Turkish descent who arrived in the
Netherlands to do unskilled labor, or racist stereotypes towards people from colonial territories with
a history of slavery. In contrast, the Chinese immigrant group arrived in smaller numbers, often via
transnational connections and without government support (Rijkschroeff, 1998, p. 74). Within this
context, the Chinese community often provided mutual support, fostering resilience as they embarked
on building new lives in the host society. As a result, the Chinese diaspora is known to be self-reliant
which contributes to the stereotype of model minority. This sets them apart from stereotypes that
other immigrant groups are facing, which can be explained through the different point of departure
and position in society.

Paired with the passive behavior and non-confrontationality when problems arise, which is a typical
characteristic from Chinese culture, the model minority is also the group that causes the least amount
of trouble for the host society. For the second-generation Chinese Dutch, it seems they want to
conform to the model minority by looking at their high socio-economic status, but I noticed my
participants also realized the detrimental effects it can have. For example, when being confronted with
stereotypes and discrimination, there seems to be a barrier to speak up and defend oneself. My
participants are trying to overcome this, which can be recognized by their large ability for critical self-
reflection. The question of identity and belonging is highly relevant to other immigrant groups, but the
model minority is an extra dimension that is not applicable to all groups. Hence, I argue that the
second-generation Chinese Dutch has notable differences and therefore my results cannot represent
other minority groups. I can imagine how for example within Turkish and Moroccan communities,
religion plays an important role which can result in a religious identity, something that is not applicable
in my research.

From immigrant groups it is expected to either integrate, or in some cases, assimilate towards the host
society (Verkuyten, 1994, p. 114). But when it is an immigrant group that is not desired by the host
society, they may not be accepted and thus become marginalized. From my findings, and with support


```
Identity and belonging
```
of the model minority concept, it is evident that second-generation Chinese are not marginalized and
the perception towards them is relatively positive. This is also concluded by Gijsberts et al. (2011a, p.
161), who researched the positive image the Chinese diaspora has in the Netherlands compared to
other minority groups. Nevertheless, the dominant host society can exercise power over the minority
group, thereby ascribing them towards a certain identity. As discussed in the previous chapter,
participants experience stereotyping and ‘’othering’’ in their lives, meaning they are frequently
reminded that they are not the same. A concrete example is demonstrated by participant 11 who
identified as Chinese. Through numerous cases of experiencing ‘’othering’’, he is certain he will never
be perceived as equal. Therefore, this feeling of non-acceptance has led him to turn towards his
Chinese identity. The fact that some participants did not fully identify as Dutch, is also influenced by
the fact that they are not always ascribed as such by the host society. During the Covid-19 pandemic,
this was highlighted yet again, where the Chinese diaspora was confronted with more discrimination
and as such, are ascribed an ‘’othering’’ identity. This will be discussed in more detail in my last chapter.

### 5.7 Belonging

So far, I have discussed my findings on integration and the different identities I have come across where
belonging has occasionally been mentioned. I will focus more on belonging in this part, since it is a
meaningful component of identity and more importantly, where I discovered the researched group
seemed to have less trouble in defining it. Nevertheless, for most participants, it was a turbulent
process in order to derive to the point where they are today. Kartosen’s third cross-cutting aspect of
his concept of identification can be applied here, namely ‘’feelings of belonging’’ (2016). Together with
his two other cross-cutting aspects, self-categorization and perception of commonality, which have
been discussed in the former part of this chapter, it can be understood how an individual shapes
his/her own identity. As seen in this context, belonging is an integral part of identification. Anthias
(2013) explains that ‘’belonging asks about ‘to what’ and ‘with whom’ you are a member, ‘where’ and
‘by whom’ you are accepted and you feel attached to’’. With this notion, it is possible that immigrants
feel a strong sense of belonging in the host society (where), while still identifying with their home
culture (with whom). My approach was more focused on discovering belonging in the Netherlands, or
elsewhere. The question of ‘’where do you feel most at home?’’ was often adopted, thereby
questioning to what place they feel most comfortable and at ease. I will start with instances where
participants felt little to strong sense of belonging towards their home culture and their parents’
country of origin. As participant 16 describes:


```
Identity and belonging
```
```
‘’Even though I have family in Hong Kong, the Netherlands feels more like home. But there is
always that little percentage where the Netherlands does not feel like home. I think more
people of our generation think this way.’’
```
I was introduced to participant 16 by participant 3 and interviewed him online with Microsoft Teams.
Unfortunately, the background noises of his surroundings made it hard to understand him and ask
suitable follow up questions. Participant 16 is 33 years old and lives in Rotterdam, has two children
and his spouse is also second-generation Chinese. Since he and his spouse have relatives in Hong Kong,
they often spend vacations there and therefore have a strong transnational network. He does prefer
to live in the Netherlands, describing his sense of belonging as 80%, since he can be close to his own
parents and it is also the place where he has constructed his life. It is the place he knows best, but still
he sometimes considers the possibility to live in China, or maybe somewhere else in Asia. Nevertheless,
he is realistic and is content with feeling 80% belonging in the host society. He emphasizes that where
he feels the strongest belonging to, he identifies with most. Because he has children now, he wants to
raise them with the benefits of two cultures, thereby not preferring one over the other. Even though I
have a strong sense of belonging to the host society too, I sometimes also imagine how it would be to
live in Hong Kong, which always has a nostalgic feeling to it. As second-generation Chinese, I think
there is always this bit of curiosity to discover, but the realization that the host society is the most
familiar place is what keeps most of the second-generation in the host society. I understand the
thought of participant 16 but also see the complicated barrier he faces to migrate now he has children.
With participant 16, I did not detect any affiliations with other second-generation immigrants of Asian
countries, which is similar to findings of all participants. The panethnic Asianness Kartosen (2016)
researched in the Netherlands did not come to the surface through my results. Often, participants
would mediate their identity between their home culture and the host society, where cultures from
other Asian countries did not have a role to the extent that it would be part of their identity.

Another example of sense of belonging to China, is from participant 18. Since he has lived in China
since age 18, he feels a strong sense of belonging to his home culture. His hybrid identity enabled him
to consciously choose which culture he preferred most. His choice to move to China, was because he
had positive experiences with education in Chinese. He enjoyed the hierarchy and respect towards
teachers and imagined it would suit him better. When he started his bachelor program, he wanted to
discover if he would truly find more positive sense of belonging in China. As I spoke to him, he seemed
satisfied with his choice but would at times miss his family in the Netherlands. He did not miss the
Netherlands as a country, but wants to keep his opportunities open for in the future. I realized his
transnational network has empowered him, and he is now able to live and acculturate in two different


```
Identity and belonging
```
societies. I was also curious to know how he looked towards the second-generation Chinese Dutch in
general, and to what level they still fit into Chine culture. As he observed, he thinks most of them are
‘’bananas’’, implying the high level of acculturation towards the host society while still retaining
physical markers of their ethnic background. Maybe this can also explain why participants felt a
stronger sense of belonging to the host society, as this is the place they know best and have lived in
their whole life. Another explanation why participants felt a strong sense of belonging to the host
society, is through the constant negotiation and acculturation in their lives, they now feel it is only
righteous to claim they belong. They did not have to do this for their home culture or their parents’
place of birth, because they do not live there. Participants shared how they experienced visiting China,
and the strong sense of not-belonging they experienced there seemed even more prevalent. An
example is given by participant 10, who did an internship in Hong Kong. At first, she had a strong
connection to Hong Kong and at first thought she belongs there, since she did not feel complete
belonging in the Netherlands. She explains her internship as follows:

```
‘’It was a reality check to discover, how do I fit in this culture? At that moment I did discover it
was not made for me, I really don’t want to work there. It was fun for a few months, but life is
tough there and then I realized I’m more Dutch than I thought I was [...] They looked at me as
a foreigner. Even worse, I was being discriminated there too.’’
```
Though participant 10 shared instances where she faced discrimination in the host society, it seemed
she endured it in more extreme forms during her time in Hong Kong. Colleagues would make
comments on how she looked different, and how she behaves too Western. Apart from that, the
working culture was different than she is used to, and she prefers the Dutch working culture over the
Chinese. As second-generation Chinese, participants have a conceptualization of their home culture
from what they know and have been exposed to, which is dominantly taught from their parents. Their
frame of reference usually does not reach the extent where they can make a comparison between
Dutch and Chinese working culture. Chinese culture can mean so much more and participant 10
experienced this in practice and learned that the Chinese working culture is not what she wants to
identify with. She explains the host society feels like home for her now, and she wishes to remain
because her two children are born and raised here. She explained how her Hong Kong identity card
needs to be renewed, but she only does so in order to satisfy the wishes of her mother.

```
‘’I really don’t have the need to return. I do it for her (her mother), she has done great effort so
that me and my brother would get the ID card [...] I’m married, have two children, if shit hits
the fan I’m not going to flee on my own.’’
```

```
Identity and belonging
```
Holding two nationalities is favored by more Chinese parents, which I have observed in my daily life
also. In Hong Kong, it is more complicated to acquire an identity card when born elsewhere. To
maintain the right to it, regular renewals every few years is required which can only be done physically.
Among first-generation Chinese, holding onto their original nationality has both symbolic and practical
reasons. It can serve as a backup plan, for when life in the Netherlands does not turn out to be as
imagined. Therefore, they wish for their children to preserve their Chinese nationality. In the case of
participant 10, she holds onto it to satisfy her mother’s wishes, but does not feel the longing to belong
in Hong Kong. She is content with her situation at present, surrounded in a multicultural environment
which she thinks is safe for her children. She is aware that this might be different if they were to live
in a small rural town, and therefore prefers to live in an urban and multicultural environment. Though
she feels a strong sense of belonging to the host society, she does not identify fully as such and neither
does she wishes to. She described her identity as ‘’50/50’’, because she does not want to choose one
over the other. It is a relative example that belonging and identity can be different to each other.

This is more apparent from participant 11, who describes his identity as Hong Kongese because he was
raised ‘’traditionally’’, meaning with Chinese culture and values. Still, he feels a strong sense of
belonging to the host society because this is where he was raised and formed his whole life. When I
questioned his Dutch identity, he would stress that no matter what, he is different. This is where the
quote at the start of this chapter was from:

_‘’A dog being raised by lions, is still a dog. It does not suddenly become a lion.’’_

He meant to describe that even if he was raised by Dutch parents, where he would still retain physical
markers of his ethnic background and therefore remain different. It shows his belief that no matter to
what degree he integrates to the host society, he would still be different. Yet again, this is an example
where the influences from the host society impact an individual to such extent that their belonging
and identity are manifested in opposite directions. In the case of participant 11, he feels different
because his perception is that he is seen as different. I comprehend the difficulties, since participant
11 shared the negative experiences he was confronted with during childhood, but find it surprising
how large the impact is on his adult life. I noticed how he takes pride in his Chinese identity and is able
to embrace his physical markers from his ethnic background. Since he could not find acceptance and
was faced with ‘’othering’’, he identifies as Chinese. However, he feels a strong sense of belonging to
the host society because his family lives here and it is the place he is most familiar with. Through
claiming his place through belonging, he shows he is part of the host society even though not


```
Identity and belonging
```
identifying as such. I find this a strong argument to show that he does not let himself be marginalized
and a creative way to still be part of the society without the desire to identify as such.

The amount of acceptance from the host society perceived by the individual seems to have a long
lasting impact on participants’ belonging. Participant 14, for example, always had identified as Dutch,
but has lived abroad for many years to discover if she could find belonging elsewhere. After 14 years
of living abroad, it was her spouse who convinced her to return to the Netherlands. Around 6 years
after returning to the Netherlands, she can happily say her belonging is now congruent with her Dutch
identity. She lives close to her mother, close to where she grew up and has her own restaurant in the
same street as where her parents had their restaurant. Different to participant 11, she did not face any
discrimination or ‘’othering’’ while growing up. Also, she enjoyed much freedom from her parents
while growing up. In a place where she feels accepted, it is a logical explanation that she found her
belonging in the host society after all.

To finalize, some participants question the sense of belonging of their parents, noticing they have
acculturated to the host society significantly. In the case of participant 1 and 18, who are siblings, their
mother lives in the Netherlands, and their father lives in China. Throughout the interview of participant
18, it became clear that their mother preferred to acculturate more towards the host society, while
their father missed the home culture too much and had the desire to remigrate. In this situation, they
had different influences from each parent, giving them easier access and opportunities to explore both
cultures. A similar observation was made with participant 14, describing that her parents never had
the idea to remigrate, and found their belonging in the Netherlands many years ago. They had little
contact with the Chinese community and as participant 14 describes, ‘’Chinese people think my
parents are weird and don’t understand them’’. The second-generation finds itself in a position where
there is the luxury to choose between two cultures, but it might also inflict confusion in sensemaking
of what place and culture to belong to. I did not detect much resistance towards one’s own home
culture among participants, but there is the willingness to be different than the first-generation,
explained through the hybrid identity formations most participants embrace.

### 5.8 Conclusion

I discovered five types of identities among my participants, namely the hybrid identity, Dutch identity,
Chinese identity, non-nation identity and ascribed identities. The diversity of them highlights the wide
range of possibilities second-generation Chinese can identify with. A hybrid identity implies
identification with both Dutch and Chinese, where participants do not want to choose one over the


```
Identity and belonging
```
other. The hybridity allows them to remain flexible, adapt to the situation at hand, and adopt what
they believe is valuable. Participants use their hybrid identity strategically, depending on the situation,
both domestically and abroad. A dominantly Dutch identity was claimed by three participants. All three
participants share commonalities, including limited contact with others from the Chinese community
during their upbringing, being the youngest in their households, and experiencing relatively low
pressures from the host society.

Two participants showed the complete opposite within the scope of identity, and described their
identity as Chinese. Two sorts of identities were discussed which I did not expect at the start of my
research and illustrates the limitation of the predefined categories offered by my literature review,
namely the non-nation identity and the ascribed identity. Two participants did not wish to identify with
a nation, ethnicity, or culture. Both participants struggled to find a strong perception of commonality
with either their home culture or the host society, which can be distinguished as the marginalization
strategy from Berry’s acculturation framework. In the course of my research, the concept of ascribed
identity emerged to be of importance. None of the participants described their identity as such, but
through extensive analysis I can observe instances where their identities were ascribed to by their
social surroundings. Through stereotyping, the model minority and ‘’othering’’, the second-generation
is reminded that they are a minority and therefore different compared to the host society’s culture.

The discussion of belonging centers around Kartosen’s third aspect of identification, ‘’feelings of
belonging’’. Belonging is presented as an integral part of identity formation, focusing on membership,
acceptance, and attachment to specific groups or places. The role of acceptance from the host society
is highlighted as a crucial factor influencing participants' sense of belonging. Some participants faced
discrimination and "othering" both in the host society and in their parents' country of origin, impacting
their feelings of belonging. I did not detect strong affiliations towards a panethnic culture, where
connection with other Asian immigrant groups is sought. Much analysis has been done on how my
participants shaped their identity and belonging, and I noticed much reference was made to their
parents. Lastly, I argue identity and belonging are not always symmetric to each other. Throughout my
research, I discovered participants could feel a sense of belonging to a certain place, but identify with
a different culture.

### 6.1 Introduction

While the quote from participant 1 0 praises the participants of the #StopAsianHate protests for
speaking up, the image ironically shows a group of participants quietly protesting with self-made signs.
On the day of the protest, it was raining and the number of people allowed to demonstrate was limited
due to the restrictions imposed by the government. During the protests, participants remained
distanced to each other and the mouth masks they wore resulted in a quiet protest. This gives the
photos afterwards a dramatic and serious atmosphere, making it look different compared to other
mass protests.

In this last chapter, I focus mainly on the Covid- 19 pandemic and the imagined future of the second-
generation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, more discrimination towards people of Chinese and East-
Asian descent was reported (Fiere & van Bon, 2020). The pandemic is used as an example where the
Chinese diaspora faced discrimination and ‘’othering’’ from the host society. From the previous
findings discussed, I explore how participants navigate their identity and belonging, where a large focus
was on their daily interaction with their home culture and host society. The aim is to explore how the
pandemic has affected their identity and belonging in the host society. Furthermore, I want to discover
how the researched group imagines their own future and the future of the second-generation in
general. As a group that has been born and raised in the host society, I am curious to know how they
predict their own identity and belonging. To allow for more creative imagination, I often phrased the
questions concerning the third-generation. Some participants have children, which allowed for a more
realistic dialogue. This chapter is focused to answer my second and third sub question.

I interviewed two organizations that aim to increase Chinese media representation and combat
discrimination against the Chinese, and also East-Asian diaspora. Asian Raisins is an organization
formed at the peak of the pandemic. Until present, they are still fighting for the same cause, but have
grown significantly and now have become an active negotiation and lobbying partner to governmental
institutions. Yang’s Voices Podcast is hosted by Oscar and he invites guests in order to interview them
in an informal way. These two organizations are in close contact with the Chinese community, and can
help to understand what is done from the community to become part of the host society, and how
resistance is exercised to claim a place in society.

### 6.2 Covid-19 and the aftermath Acknowledgements

During my data collection process, I observed that the participants faced very little discrimination
during the Covid-19 pandemic. This could be due to the fact that all of the participants reside in


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
culturally diverse cities, where there is a higher level of acceptance and familiarity with people from
other cultures. Despite this, the participants expressed strong support and solidarity towards the
#StopAsianHate protest, but did not take much practical action. The #StopAsianHate movement
originates from the United States of America (Lyu et al., 2023), where more extreme forms of hate
towards people of Asian descent occurred, which was also inflicted by politicians (Gover et al., 2020;
Stop AAPI Hate, 2022). The urge for my participants to join the protest was low due to the fact that
they perceived minimal change in their circumstances compared to the pre-pandemic period.
Additionally, the overall increased discrimination in the Netherlands was less critical than in the United
States of America, diminishing the urge to speak up. Two #StopAsianHate protests were organized on
the Museum square of Amsterdam in March and April 2021. The direct reason for the first protest was
inflicted by the terrorist attack directed towards people of Asian descent in Atlanta, United States of
America, resulting in 8 casualties (Martine Kamara & van Dalsum, 2021). The protest got a lot of media
attention because people of Asian descent do not often organize protests. Participant 16 shared his
perception on the #StopAsianHate protest, which is as follows:

```
‘’I was somehow surprised it happened (the #StopAsianHate protests), because we tend to stay
in the background. I was surprised, but think it’s good they speak up. But I didn’t feel the need
and didn’t feel compelled to participate myself. ‘’
```
Participant 16 did not experience any negative behavior towards him during the pandemic. This finding
is consistent with many other participants that I interviewed. It may explain why they did not join the
protest or participate in discussions in general, as they do not see themselves as victims. However, as
participant 16 mentioned, the Chinese community tends to stay in the background, and I believe this
behavior can be observed in my participants as well. Most participants preferred to avoid conflicts,
remain in the background, and conform to the requirements of the host society. When examining
Berry's acculturation framework, the majority of the participants fit into the "integration strategy" and
the "assimilation strategy". These strategies seek harmony with the host society, making it
controversial to exercise resistance. The accumulation of these strategies, along with the
aforementioned arguments, can explain why participants did not participate in the public debate
against discrimination towards the Chinese community. In previous chapters, I explained how
participants prefer to position themselves in environments where they feel safest and where they can
find the most acceptance from the host society. I observed how this safe environment for some is
where they positioned themselves during the pandemic. For example, participant 5 recounts:


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
```
‘’I did not experience discrimination during the pandemic. The reason why is because I rarely
left my home, and then I’m not confronted with these things. And secondly, I was able to work
from home, still with the same people.’’
```
Due to the government's imposed restrictions on movements at the time, it was strongly advised to
stay at home as much as possible. Participant 5's experience highlights that staying at home reduces
the chances of facing discrimination as there is less exposure to society. Participant 5 also mentioned
that he limited his social circle to his colleagues. I had a similar experience during the pandemic where
I did not experience an increase in discriminatory behavior towards me. However, identical to
participant 5, I also remained indoors as much as possible and tried to do as much as possible from
home. I tried to do groceries outside of peak hours in order to avoid contact with others. These were
all measurements that were in line with the government’s advisories, but it also reduced my chances
of being confronted to discrimination. When I asked how it was for participant 5 to travel by public
transport, he acknowledged he did not take public transport at that time due to the fear of contracting
the virus. Similarly, participant 2 had a comparable experience that can be used as a relevant example:

```
‘’At the time of the lockdown I was still living in the city center of Amsterdam. Especially the
city center is multicultural and the city takes its pride in that regard. You don’t see people look
up if there are colored people on the street.’’
```
Again, this serves as an example of how one individual was able to maintain a sense of safety and
comfort within his environment. Specifically, Participant 2 acknowledged that he was not subjected to
discrimination while living in the city center and was able to blend in with his surroundings. He did
note, however, that due to the pandemic, the second-generation of immigrants has become more
vocal and confrontational. Although he sympathizes with the #StopAsianHate protests, participant 2
believes that it is up to each individual to decide how much they want to be involved in it. For himself,
he did not feel compelled to join this movement because he believes that the second-generation needs
to show their very best on a daily basis in order to achieve acceptance. He understands that if he were
to misbehave, this would reflect on others from the Chinese community. By actively integrating and
achieving fluency in the Dutch language, he believes that one can find greater acceptance in the host
society. This strategy has worked well for him, but he recognizes that it may not be as effective for
others. For this reason, many participants continue to hold onto their hybrid identity. During events
such as the Covid-19 pandemic, when there is suddenly less acceptance from the host society, there is
a possibility to turn to the Chinese community and find commonality there. Two participants joined
the #StopAsianHate protest. One of them was Amy, chairwoman from Asian Raisins. She was involved


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
in the organization of the protest. Participant 6 joined the protest on his own because he felt
empowered by the idea to protest as a group. He explains:

```
‘’I think you don’t hear much from Chinese in the media about discrimination and racism. That’s
why I thought it was very good and that was the reason I joined.’’
```
Participant 6 shared he experienced insults from strangers during the pandemic. When hearing about
the protest, he felt this was the right moment and opportunity for him to become actively engaged.
What makes participant 6 stand out from other participants was that he indicated to have experienced
more negative behavior towards him during the pandemic, which resulted in the motivation to take
part of the protest. He learned that there are people who want to listen to each other because they
face similar experiences. For him, the protest showed the power a group can have when organized
together and social issues only get attention when it is escalated to a higher level. It was pleasant to
see how he could find unity among a group and share his experiences with. Unfortunately, he was
slightly more pessimistic when I asked him on the long term changes of the impact. He felt the media
attention has lost its momentum and slowly things are turning back to how it used to be. His opinion
is that the bigger minority groups in the Netherlands, such as the Moroccan and Turkish, should take
the lead in anti-discrimination discourses, arguing the Chinese community is too small to make a real
impact. Observing this, I noticed how the general characteristics of Chinese culture often described by
participants, to ‘’remain in the background’’ and ‘’avoid conflicts’’, can also be recognized in their
evasion of the #StopAsianHate protests. Indeed, it also encourages to question again the integration
process of the second-generation. Participant 7 observes the following:

_‘’In general, Chinese Dutch are absent in the anti-racist discourse.’’_

With this saying, the second-generation is also conforming to the model minority stereotype by staying
away from conflicts with the host society. It is congruent with the opinion of participant 6 his, where
other minority groups should set the tone. Participant 7 acknowledges that she thinks the Chinese
community faces ‘’micro aggressions’’, and that other minority groups in the host society are treated
worse. When faced with micro aggressions, second-generation Chinese might think the severity of the
issue is not significant enough to face the confrontation, which can also be reinforced by the desire to
remain in the background. I believe the second-generation Chinese still has large steps to make in
claiming their place in society by facing the confrontation. However, the #StopAsianHate protest is a
suitable initiative and I could see it has left a positive impression on my participants. As mentioned
earlier, my participants did not face severe discrimination during the pandemic, which explains their


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
absence in the protest because they did not feel compelled to do so. Only participant 6 was confronted
with insults, while other participants experienced no to little remarks about increased discrimination
during the pandemic. With this result, it is no surprise that the pandemic and the subsequent protest
had little impact on the belonging and identity of the researched group. Nevertheless, I observed there
was much support for the cause and in some instances, participants made a comparison with the first-
generation. As participant 13 describes:

```
‘’I think the second-generation would face the confrontation more easily. I think because of the
language barrier, the first-generation had trouble to do the same. [...] The second-generation
doesn’t accept this and like most Dutch people, are more direct.’’
```
However, much of my data shows second-generation individuals still prefer to be non-confrontational
and remain in the background. I think the #StopAsianHate protest was for many participants an
empowering image, where it could be seen that there is a possibility to unite and confront the host
society. Even though the debate has quiet down and lost its media attention, the protest can be
symbolized as an act of integration. By organizing together alongside other Asian minority groups, the
second-generation claims its space in the host society. Indeed, compared to the first-generation, this
is a major step towards inclusiveness and claim for acceptance in society.

### 6.3 The future

Much of the findings presented so far were from a retrospect view. In this section, I will lay the focus
on the future. It is relevant to ask how second-generation Chinese foresee their own future, as it can
help to understand the way they perceive their own identity and belonging. Apart from participant 18,
all other participants imagined their own future in the host society. Main reasons for this is because
they have constructed their whole lives in the host society and it is the place they are most familiar
with. Even though it can be hard to navigate their position in society at times, they have integrated to
such extent that this is where they feel they belong. A quote form participant 15 can be helpful in
understanding this, recollecting her first visit to Hong Kong:

```
‘’If I looked to other people, I did not recognize myself. I knew I looked foreign, only by looking
at my clothes, how I wear my make-up, my posture. They were all smaller, thinner. It did not
feel like home, I couldn’t really blend in.’’
```

```
Covid-19 and the future
```
For her, Hong Kong is the place where her father is from and in that regard she felt nostalgic to the
place. However, she also experienced a culture shock when visiting Hong Kong because of the language
barrier and social etiquette. For example, whenever she would accidently bump into someone on the
crowded streets, she would apologize. The people she apologized to looked confused, because in
normal etiquette people would continue their journey as if nothing happened. Furthermore, she had
a hard time communicating in Cantonese Chinese, admitting she was not able to understand her own
relatives. This insight is an example why participants foresee their future in the host society, because
they come to realize they are more distant to their home culture. Furthermore, some participants
experience discrimination from their own home culture, such as when participant 10 lived in Hong
Kong for a while. While she was still questioning her belonging in the host society because she did not
feel total acceptance, she found even less acceptance in Hong Kong. This resulted in a strong feeling
of non-belonging towards her home culture.

Other observations I made were from participants who described their identity as hybrid. When asked
about their identity in the future, they think it would shift more towards a Dutch identity. All
participants were adults and they expected the older they would get, the less contact they will have
with their home culture. Their strongest connection towards the home culture was when they were
growing up, which they were taught primarily by their parents. Now having reached adulthood, they
expect to integrate further within the host society. However, participants with a hybrid identity did not
wish to assimilate to the host society and remain some sort of hybridity. However, since their exposure
to their home culture is becoming less, a shift is expected to occur. By brainstorming on the future
generation, participants had the opportunity to actively think about how they would raise their own
children. This allowed them to assess their own upbringing and actively think what aspects they would
discard or maintain. I discovered integration was a recurring theme in this matter. To illustrate,
participant 8 shares the following thought:

```
‘’My husband is Dutch and others (second-generation) often also have Dutch partners. So it’s
mixing, and that’s normal of course. [...] I expect to stay here for many years, so I think I’ll
eventually identify more with the white surrounding because that is the surrounding I am in. I
foresee that my children will come home with a Dutch partner or another ethnicity. It will thin
out the Chinese bloodline.’’
```
In the case of participant 8, she explicitly acknowledged her sense of belonging in the host society. I
was introduced to participant 8 with the help of Asian Raisins. I conducted the interview at her home.
She works part time because her daughter is two years old and she prefers to spend as much time with


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
her as possible. At the time of the interview, she was due to give birth to her second daughter in a few
months’ time. Her two year old daughter was adorable and just learning to speak, and I noticed she
was using both Chinese and Dutch language in her speech. Participant 8 taught her to address me as
‘’uncle’’ in Chinese, a common way to respectfully address elders that are not straight relatives of
yours. By studying the quote, it becomes evident that she anticipates a convergence of her identity
with her establishes sense of belonging within the host society. Since her spouse is Dutch, she does
not think her children will deal with the same identification process as she did. Despite this, she will
still attempt to raise them with values of her home culture but does not approve of having extremely
high expectations, which she experienced during her own upbringing. I could see that she made a
deliberate choice in adopting the positive and discarding the negative from her childhood. This is the
benefit of being raised in a bicultural environment, where individuals can decide for themselves what
works for them and with what culture they like to identify with.

While the findings presented has occasionally been described with certain negative connotations by
the participants, the majority of the participants still self-identify as hybrid. This suggests that there
are still features from the home culture that are meaningful for them. I noticed participants want to
distant their own children from the aforementioned tiger parenting. Many participants would like to
give their children more freedom, stimulate dialogue and promote hobbies that the children like. The
strict hierarchy between parent and child becomes blur, which seems impossible to imagine in a tiger
parenting environment. I found an example from participant 17 noticeable:

_‘’You don’t want to be different and shape your own opinion. And feelings, also very hard to
express. I’m still learning to talk about feelings [...] I’m doing that differently with my children
and it is easier for them and we can make fun. Then I think, I wish I had that when growing up.’’_

Participant 17 described how she was faced with the highest expectations because she is the eldest of
her siblings. She embraces her hybrid identity but believes the upbringing she enjoyed had some
shortcomings, which are mentioned in the quote. Her spouse is Dutch and together they try to raise
their children with a mixture of both cultures. When participant 17 was growing up, she and her
younger sisters never wanted to be different, and at times resented their home culture. For that
reason, I could see that she wanted her children to integrate more freely and not be different than
other children. As a child, she also experienced parental violence whenever she would misbehave.
Along with other participants who shared this same characteristic in their upbringing, she does not
want to incorporate that in her parenting. Only one participant admitted he would incorporate
parental violence in his parenting if he were to have children, but stresses he will always try to explain


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
the significance of the matter and the context. One remarkable example I would like to highlight is
from participant 2:

```
‘’I don’t want to put my children in a corner. I want them to mingle and integrate in school even
though they look different. [...] I want my children to go through life with high self-esteem. The
moment you forbid them things, it has direct influence on their self-esteem. [...] Now I’m a
father, I’m compensating, maybe overcompensating, because I want to give them the
shortcomings from my own upbringing.’’
```
It bears resemblance with remarks I observed throughout my data collection on the upbringing
participants enjoyed themselves. Participants were aware their parents had gone through a difficult
journey when immigrating to the host society. Coming from a background with limited resources, the
first-generation wanted their offspring to have what they did not have when growing up, such as
wealth, education and in some instances, food. It explains the high focus on academic achievements,
because the general believe is that this leads the way to high positioned livelihoods, filling the void of
the shortcomings they experienced. I notice the second-generation is acting from the same philosophy
and intent. To illustrate, participant 2 wants to give his children freedom; participant 18 wants to be a
fun parent; participant 16 wants to give his children emotional and intellectual space; participant 6
wants to show them affection; and participant 10 wants to spend more time with her children. Through
detailed analysis of the data, I noticed these are all examples they think was absent when growing up.
In a conversation I had with participant 4 after the interview, he said he does not blame his parents for
anything because they were also only copying the upbringing they once enjoyed. However, a similar
remark can be made for the second-generation. Although they think to distance themselves and be
different than the first-generation, the way of thinking shares the same point of departure; giving their
children the things they did not have. By doing so, the second-generation aims to be different than the
first-generation by incorporating elements from the host society’s culture. Ironically, it shares close
resemblance at the same time.

By parenting their children in a way that is more geared towards the host society, participants expect
the third-generation to have an easier identification process. As participant 5 described, there will be
more interracial partnerships leading to future generations with mixed ethnicities. In this way, it is
expected that there is less conflict in finding ones identity. However, I would like to apply caution to
this prediction because individuals with mixed ethnic heritage can still face identity negotiation.
According to Tsai (2022), mixed heritage individuals experience ‘’denial, objectification, racial imposter
syndrome, and anxiety’’. Mixed heritage can therefore also lead to feelings of non-belonging, as they


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
can face difficulties to self-identify with both cultural groups. However, integration towards the host
society can be easier when second-generation Chinese adopt a hybrid or Dutch parenting strategy.
This way, there will be less cultural friction and it will become easier for the third-generation to
integrate. Few participants made the comparison with acceptance from the host society at present,
and from when they were growing up. Thereby, they believe there now is more acceptance towards
other cultures in the host society, making it easier for the third-generation to integrate.

### 6.4 Asian Raisins and Yang’s Voices Podcast

In the remainder of this chapter I will focus on the two organizations I concluded in my research,
namely Asian Raisins and Yang’s Voices Podcast. Both organizations represent Chinese and other Asian
ethnicities’ voices. Asian Raisins was founded at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and their primary
goal at the time was to protest against discrimination inflicted by the pandemic. However, they have
extended their goals and now aim to fight against deeply rooted stereotypes and discrimination in the
Netherlands. Asian Raisins tries to create awareness of this and hopes to reach a more inclusive society.
Yang’s Voices Podcast is run by host and creator Oscar, where each informal podcast episode is
dedicated to interview his guest. Through these interviews, he aims to portray his guests each as a
unique individual and by doing so, hopes to take away common stereotypes. Both organizations try to
give the second-generation a voice in society, break common stereotypes, increase media
representation for the group, and seek more acceptance in society. Their interviews are a support to
the findings presented so far, increasing the validity of my research. I will highlight the most important
highlights from the interviews I conducted with them, with the aim to discuss similarities and
differences with my findings.

I was intrigued by Oscar’s passion for his podcast. When I interviewed him, I discovered he has a
fulltime job next to his podcast. Each episode requires a lot of planning and editing, but it gives him
positive energy. In his leisure time, he follows the development of the second-generation in the host
society closely and is in touch with many second-generation individuals. I noticed the mixture of his
guests’ cultural backgrounds, and how many similarities other Asian second-generations share with
my target group. It seems that all second-generation individuals are occupied with the question of
identity and belonging, making this research field relevant for many other minority groups in the
Netherlands. I met Oscar in a café on a warm afternoon. I reached out to him through e-mail and he
was extremely enthusiastic to participate in my research. Before starting, we had an interesting chat
on the second-generation Chinese. I learned Oscar migrated to the Netherlands at age 9, which
technically would not count as second-generation. However, as he emphasized, his mindset is more in


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
line with second-generation Chinese and therefore he identifies as such. Unfortunately, the café was
a little noisy which complicated transcribing, but I am utterly satisfied content-wise. I had an
interesting talk with Oscar when we tried to look at the differences between the first- and second-
generation Chinese. Oscar mentioned:

```
‘’What I often see is that we (the second-generation) try to distant ourselves from our parents.
In the sense of, ‘I don’t want to be like my parents, even though they have the greatest wisdom,
Chinese sayings and the journey they have gone through’. Many of us want to lead our own
lives.’’
```
This result is not much of a surprise when looking at the different environment the second-generation
grows up in. The acculturation process with the host society leads to cultural values that can shift for
the second-generation. When reflecting on the high parental expectations imposed on them, some
individuals do not want to associate themselves with that part of the culture anymore and prefer the
pursuit of individual freedom that is often more supported in the host society. It also explains the
finding where I argued that participants want to raise their own children differently. Most participants
do not think their upbringing was the best method to adopt within the host society, and therefore seek
to live the life they imagine for themselves. Oscar mentions the questions, doubts and disapproval the
first-generation sometimes have on this matter, but tries to look at it positively. He mentions the high
socio-economic status many second-generation individuals have, which is something the first-
generation can be proud of. He emphasizes that there is no complete disgust towards the home
culture, but that it is inevitable that there will be some bumps on the road when looking at the
integration process the second-generation has been through. Furthermore, he believes integration is
the way to increase acceptance within the host society but remains critical on stereotypes and
discrimination towards other cultures. With more acceptance, it will be easier for people with an
immigrant background to find belonging in a host society.

Oscar made an argument which I did not detect with such emphasis among other participants. He was
very clear on the mental challenges second-generation individuals can face, and urged to be
transparent in this and look for help among each other. By seeking dialogue and sharing experiences,
support and rapport can be offered and given to each other. I recognize this from Chinese culture,
where there seems to be a taboo on acknowledging and talking about one’s problem (Chiu, 2004; Ho
& Crookall, 1995). This was also often mentioned by my participants, who admitted that they find it
difficult to express themselves at times. Throughout my data, I came across instances where
participants experienced difficulties in expressing emotions, forming opinions, admitting help from


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
others and speak up for yourself. According to Oscar, it is deeply rooted in Chinese culture to remain
introvert, oppress emotions and not talk openly about your problems. He highlights:

```
‘’You can’t solve a problem without understanding the problem first. The more we engage in
these activities, the better we can tackle the problem at the core. And we can’t do this on our
own [...] As Chinese Dutch, we can only grow by looking different towards things than our
parents did. Dare to speak up and ask for help. And, I’m sure that when you do, you will find so
many other people dealing with the same.’’
```
The problem Oscar refers to has to do with identity formation and belonging as second-generation
immigrants. In some aspect, it shares the same philosophy that many first-generation Chinese
adopted, which was to help each other out. However, the taboo that lies on asking for help and
acknowledging a problem, is a stigma that should change according to Oscar. It is through this support
and rapport that the second-generation can unite as a community and speak up against the ‘’othering’’,
stereotyping and discrimination they are confronted with. Even though it shares some similarities with
the separation strategy from Berry’s acculturation framework, characterized by close contact with the
home culture and little contact with the host culture, it can also be seen as a form of integration. By
actively tackling a problem together, more acceptance from the host society is demanded and a place
is claimed in society. By engaging in the debate, further participation in the society is the result. Oscar
highlights the second-generation cannot do nothing. Because if they do, the stereotypes will not
change. He explains:

```
‘’We cannot lean back as a community. Because if we do, they will walk over us, 100%. That’s
why it’s so important we join the discussion and put ourselves in the spotlight. [...] It’s bad when
people associate us with politics in China. That’s why we need to mitigate this way of thinking,
by manifesting ourselves.’’
```
It is clear that Oscar thinks the second-generation should take responsibility and join the public debate.
He is aware that it is natural to think of people in stereotypes and prejudices, but troubles the fact that
people in the host society sometimes behave accordingly. This is the basis of discrimination and
therefore Oscar hopes to portray his guests in the podcast as unique individuals. I noticed Oscar did
not urge for assimilation towards the host society, because he also stressed the importance of the
Chinese community and family. He thinks the hybridity that the second-generation enjoys should be
seen as something valuable, since there is the possibility to navigate between two cultures. He hopes
the Covid-19 pandemic is a starting point for the second-generation to unite and speak up. The


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
interview with Oscar bears much resemblance with my other findings presented. However, his strong
urge to find support and rapport among each other as a community is not detected on a high frequency
among my participants. I noticed my participants did not sought much contact with other Chinese
Dutch. If they did, it was because of the perceptions of commonality, but I did not detect the necessity
to engage in dialogue with each other to talk about the problems they were facing in their identity and
belonging process.

I interviewed Amy, chairwoman of Asian Raisins, online through Microsoft Teams. She is one of the
founding members of the foundation, which was established at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Starting out as a Facebook group, the initiative gained a large number of members in a short period of
time. It served as a platform where people with a Chinese or Asian descent could share their
experiences in the host society. All of the work from Asian Raisins is done on a voluntary basis, which
she acknowledged can be difficult to combine in their daily lives. Through this interview, I learned that
Amy used the term ‘’OZOA people’’ (Oost en Zuid-Oost Aziatische), which is an acronym for people
with an East and South-East Asian background. Since its establishment, Asian Raisins had to readjust
its goals several times, including their group of representation. Though they are against all forms of
discrimination, they soon realized it is not feasible to represent everyone. This led to the definition of
‘’OZOA people’’, which is now their scope of representation. Amy explained how Asian Raisins
managed to get media attention because of its relevance with the pandemic at the time. Their media
coverage quickly built momentum which helped them to spread their message. Surprisingly, Amy
discussed the model minority phenomenon too, which can help to understand Asian Raisin’s mission:

```
‘’The model minority creates possibilities for us, making it look like we’re equals to the host
society, while it is a barrier at the same time. You see many of us are highly educated and have
nice jobs, but we rarely fulfill leadership roles. The stereotype of the hard working Asian doesn’t
always pay off, because it doesn’t symbolize creativity or leadership. So if you look at the
cultural sector, we are underrepresented because there are not that many actors or actresses.’’
```
This model minority, according to Amy, is a basic fundament for subtle discrimination that OZOA
individuals can be exposed to. Amy mentions in her quote that the model minority can be a barrier
too, which can be explained because stereotypes can be based on cultural characteristics. When
second-generation individuals live up to them, they confirm the existence of certain stereotypes too.
It can be a vicious circle, where one variable fuels another variable and vice versa. Amy explained how
the model minority is different from other forms of discrimination, which is the reason why Asian
Raisins had to redefine their group of representation. Amy was cautious that the model minority leads


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
to a blind spot in the host society, causing people to underestimate the harm it can do. For instance,
she emphasized the lack of government-funded research addressing discrimination against OZOA
minority groups within the host society. This absence of official acknowledgment increases the
challenges of Asian Raisins because it may appear as though they are grappling with a non-existent
problem. I came to this same realization when looking for literature, noticing that most of the research
of second-generation Chinese comes from other Western countries, such as the United States of
America, Canada and Australia. The most recent study on the Chinese diaspora conducted by the Social
and Cultural Planning Office dates back to 2011. The Social and Cultural Planning Office is a
governmental agency dedicated to researching the social aspects of various policy domains. In this
outdated report, the Chinese community is portrayed as a minority group that integrates well into the
host society and experiences minimal discrimination, already being characterized as a model minority
by the authors (Gijsberts et al., 2011a). Most other research on the second-generation Chinese Dutch
adopt a quantitative research approach (Huijnk et al., 2015; Linder et al., 2011; Verkuyten & Kwa,
1996), making the individual stories of my research group untold.

This lack of governmental acknowledged research leads to under highlighted attention of the problem
in the host society. In the years after the SCP publication, many changes have occurred. Except for the
Covid-19 pandemic, China has been more present in geopolitical discourse. This concern was at some
points also coined by participants, who feared for escalations between China and Western countries.
Due to the rise of China on the geopolitical stage, Amy described how people sometimes think Asian
Raisins is controlled and funded by the Chinese government. However untrue, it shows there are some
conceptions where the host society relates the Chinese diaspora with politics in China. It is a similar
occurrence with the Covid-19 pandemic, where the Chinese community became a scapegoat in the
host society because it was believed that the virus originated from China. Amy explains the importance
of media framing in these instances:

```
‘’Geopolitical developments have strong influences on the perception towards the Chinese
community. [...] It is about how the media frames it. They can decide that when speaking about
Corona, to not only show pictures of Chinese. Separate the Chinese government from the
Chinese people. [...] I don’t think China will have an amazing relationship with European
countries all of a sudden, but I do see it positive because there is such a big difference between
our generation and our parents. For the first time, we dare to speak up.’’
```
Amy is aware that media framings can result in certain behavior towards Chinese, and therefore fears
geopolitical escalations could have detrimental consequences for the Chinese community. For this


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
reason, she thinks it is important second-generation Chinese let their voices be heard. It is similar to
the argument of Oscar, urging for more participation from second-generation individuals in anti-
discrimination discourses. I noticed how a certain amount of responsibility is ascribed to the second-
generation, something I did not clearly observe among my participants. Many participants were aware
that their behavior could reflect on others from the Chinese community, but they did not take much
responsibility to actively speak up against discrimination. For instance, one participant thought it was
the responsibility of bigger immigrant groups to speak up and pave the way for smaller minority
groups, while another was convinced that Chinese immigrants have integrated well enough and found
it unnecessary to become activistic. It is through events such as the Covid-19 pandemic where more
unity and solidarity could be observed among participants. Outside of that, they seemed to be more
individualistic in their journey towards finding their place in society. Though they sympathize with the
missions of Asian Raisins and Yang’s Voices Podcast, they seem to withdraw of being in the spotlights
themselves. This is where Amy and Oscar try to be cautious for, that taking a passive place in society
can lead to continuation of stereotypes. It seems that participants are occupied to internalize their
own identity and belonging, that there is little focus on the macro impact they can have in the larger
society. According to Amy, identity and belonging for the second-generation Chinese is difficult. She
explains this as follows:

```
‘’People don’t feel completely attached to their Chinese background, because you are not
Chinese enough because your command of Chinese language is not good enough or you don’t
know what to wear on a specific holiday. You are also not Dutch enough because you don’t look
like it. So you’re being kicked out of both groups.’’
```
This quote resonates with many instances from my data collection and it becomes clear that my
findings are acknowledged by Asian Raisins. However, this result is not discovered in the Social and
Cultural Planning Office report from 2011 and therefore highlights the importance of identity and
belonging. The many hybrid identities encountered in my data demonstrates how second-generation
individuals position themselves ‘’in the middle’’. This means there is distance, but not complete
abandonment to their home culture. The same can be said about the host society’s culture, which for
many participants still does not feel as their own culture. For this reason, the #StopAsianHate protest
was about belonging rather than identity. By claiming they are part of society, the protest was aimed
to foster acceptance from the host society (Asian Raisins, 2021).

According to Amy, the Chinese community is not the only minority group facing similar experiences
and therefore refers to ‘’OZOA people’’. Nevertheless, the lack of research on this group is worrisome


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
for Asian Raisins. Amy made a comparison with other Western countries, where there is more
government funded social research and acknowledgement of the issue is more evolved. Therefore, she
hopes to see more research on this group in the Netherlands, preferably funded by the government.
Through research, more attention is given on the issue which can lead to more awareness and
acceptance in the host society. Lastly, Amy highlights that the Covid-19 pandemic was not the moment
where OZOA people were first confronted with non-acceptance, but that it has been present long
before that already. Therefore, she can now assess the pandemic from a positive perspective, since
dramatic events tend to lead to increase media attention. The results of my thesis seem to share many
similarities with the activities of Asian Raisins and Yang’s Voices Podcast. The absence of second-
generation Chinese in the media and public discourse has led to an invisible minority group. Through
our activities, the narratives are told from this specific group, showing the host society that we are all
part of the society and not just the stereotypes.

### 6.3 Conclcusion............................................................................................................................

In this chapter, I discuss the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the future that participants imagine for
themselves, and the results from the interviews conducted with Asian Raisins and Yang’s Voices
Podcast. Though I discovered empathy with the #StopAsianHate protests from participants, there was
little practical action that derived from the pandemic. This can be attributed to the fact that my
participants did not perceive a high increase of ‘’othering’’ towards them. Participants tend to stay in
the background and avoid conflicts, which explains their absence in the public discourse around
#StopAsianHate. However, some participants felt empowered by the protest, reinforcing their belief
in integration, leading to a stronger claim for societal inclusion. The #StopAsianHate protest served as
an example of this mindset shift among participants. In discussing their future identity and belonging,
most participants, except one, expressed a sense of belonging to the host society. Hence, some
participants think their future identity is likely to shift more towards a Dutch identity, which is also
explained due to the fact that there is less exposure to their home culture since reaching adulthood.
They expect that their hybridity will be more pronounced and less complicated the more they integrate
into the host society. The bicultural upbringing is viewed as advantageous, allowing them to selectively
adopt cultural aspects. Participants reject the tiger parenting style they experienced, aiming to raise
their children with a parenting approach aligned with host society values. They aspire to provide their
children with opportunities they lacked, reflecting a shared philosophy with the first-generation: giving
their children what they themselves missed in their upbringing.


```
Covid-19 and the future
```
In the remainder of the chapter, I present my findings from the interviews conducted with Asian Raisins
and Yang’s Voices Podcast. Oscar, host and creator of Yang’s Voices Podcast, made a comparison
between the first- and second-generation Chinese. In his own environment, he sees that many second-
generation Chinese want to distant themselves from their parents and wish to lead their own lives,
distancing themselves from the tiger parenting they experienced. He emphasized the importance of
sharing ones problems with others from the Chinese community, since this can be a helpful strategy
to find support from each other. Ultimately, Oscar wishes that the second-generation becomes even
more active in the public debate in order to display that the Chinese diaspora is more than the
stereotypes known to the public. As the chairwoman of Asian Raisins, Amy has been involved in the
organization since its establishment. According to her, the model minority can be a barrier for minority
groups, since it withholds individuals to be anything outside of the stereotype. Also, it creates the
feeling that discrimination towards this group does not exist, which is why she wishes that the second-
generation speaks up against any forms of discrimination or stereotypes. She mentioned how a lack of
government-funded research results in absence of acknowledgement of the problem. Amy called the
scope of representation group of Asian Raisins ‘’OZOA people’’, which is an acronym for individuals
with an East and South-East Asian descent. Similar to Oscar, Amy urges for active participation from
second-generation individuals to speak up against any form of discrimination in order to claim a space
in society.

Conclusion and discussion

## 7. Conclusion and discussion

In this chapter I provide a concise overview of my research findings. Firstly, I would like to emphasize
the qualitative nature of my research and the small number of participants included compared to
quantitative methods. While my method does not allow for broad generalizations, it explores
individual challenges in navigating identity and belonging among my research group. For clarity
purposes, I restate my research question presented in my first chapter which I aim to answer in this
section:

_How do second-generation Chinese immigrants in the Netherlands self-identify, organize and
navigate their belonging in Dutch society?_

I argued the relevance of parenting behavior on identity outcomes where I discuss the phenomenon
of ‘’tiger parenting’’, referring to the protective and yet authoritative upbringing that is common
among Chinese families. Tiger parenting prioritizes academic excellence and success in various life
aspects. However, I argue how tiger parenting does not always stimulate integration into Dutch
society, despite participants' beliefs. They often think of integration based on factors like high-status
livelihoods, higher education, or employment, with the common belief that achieving a high socio-
economic status signifies successful integration. Furthermore, I demonstrate how the participants’
upbringing results in a lack of social integration, since the tiger parenting does not motivate expression
of opinions, emotions and questioning. This upbringing, focused on obedience and performance, can
lead to challenges when confronting cultural differences in the host society.

Integrating is complicated when participants face stereotyping and discrimination, reinforcing their
sense of being different from the host society. This is best described as ‘’othering’’, meaning the
treatment of people with an immigrant background as different. Participants have a hard time being
totally accepted, encountering ‘’othering’’ through jokes being made about their ethnic background,
callouts by strangers and bullying. I detected an awareness among my participants that staying close
within the Chinese community, at times referred to as a ‘’bubble’’, does not help to remove common
stereotypes. Hence, they seek active engagement with the host society.

However, I introduced the ‘’model minority’’ stereotype which seems relevant for second-generation
Chinese. This stereotype characterizes ethnic minorities as more likely to excel academically, achieve
economic stability, maintain family cohesion, and have low involvement in crime compared to other
minority groups. I recognized this among my participants, since they found it important to contribute


```
Conclusion and discussion
```
to the society, while at the same time prefer to avoid conflicts. It makes the Chinese community
vulnerable for scapegoating, as seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. By strategically placing themselves
in environments where they feel safest, my participants become conscious on how to avoid common
stereotypes. Examples are manifestations of overcompensating behavior by speaking the Dutch
language flawlessly and conforming to host society norms. I believe the phenomenon of model
minority is an accurate description of the second-generation Chinese Dutch, which helps to explain
why many of them still have difficulties in speaking up for themselves.

Berry’s acculturation framework describes four strategies minority groups can apply; assimilation,
integration, marginalization and separation. I found this framework relevant since I discovered the
importance that acculturation holds on participants’ identity and belonging. The majority adopted an
integration strategy, which is characterized by maintenance of the home culture and engagement with
the host society at the same time. I detected an assimilation strategy in three cases, which is
characterized by strong identification with the host society and little or no desire to maintain affiliation
with the home culture. Two participants applied the separation strategy and two participants adopted
the marginalization strategy. Though the latter two strategies are commonly known to perceive more
discrimination and are related to low levels of life satisfaction and mental health, I disagree with the
proposed statement from the literature since my data does not indicate notions of this among my
participants. Rather, their narratives demonstrate the voluntarily basis in adopting these strategies.
Berry’s acculturation framework has helped me in analyzing the different identities I came across in
my data.

Based on my findings, I have come up with five identities I deem relevant, namely; Dutch identity,
hybrid identity, Chinese identity, non-nation identity and ascribed identity. I believe this scope of
identities may also apply to other immigrant groups in the Netherlands, with the home culture aspect
changing accordingly. However, no ratios can be determined and there is potential for additional
identities, such as religious identities among individuals of Moroccan and Turkish descent. I applied
Kartosen’s concept of identification in the assessment of the different identities, which entails three
cross-cutting aspects; self-categorization, perception of commonality and feelings of belonging. In my
fieldwork, I did not detect any notions of a panethnic identity. Primarily, accounts of hybrid identity
was self-categorized most often which can be explained through the perception of commonality found
in both cultures. Hybridity allows flexibility in identity adaptation, with individuals choosing aspects
that suited them best, facilitating fluidity in switching between two cultures.


```
Conclusion and discussion
```
The Dutch identity was prevalent among three participants, where I observed numerous similarities.
All of them were the youngest in the household when growing up, faced a liberal upbringing where
high expectations from parents was absent, and did not face noticeable negative experiences from the
host society. From an early age, they had the liberty to integrate and explore their identity, without
any restrictions to maintain the home culture. They have little contact with the Chinese community
and have a stronger perception of commonality with the host society. The Chinese identity was
encountered among two participants who embraced close cultural affiliations inherited from their
parents. I noticed one participant who self-identified as Chinese experienced ‘’othering’’ in his
childhood, which convinced him he would never be completely accepted by the host society. This non-
acceptance has made him to identify as Chinese.

During my research, I observed the influence of ascribed identity, although not openly acknowledged
by participants. Ascribed identity occurs when others assign an identity to an individual despite their
achieved identity. I noticed how parental and societal influences played a significant role in shaping
their identities. For instance, many participants attended Chinese school after regular classes,
reinforcing their Chinese identity. Host society "othering" pushed immigrants toward certain identities,
such as the model minority. In one case, a participant who identified as Chinese had experienced
"othering" in the past that led him to reject a Dutch identity in favor of his Chinese identity. Among
two participants, I detected an identity I can best describe as ‘’non-nation identity’’, rejecting cultural
or national affiliations. I did not expect to come across this form of identification, but it is the most
accurate definition to describe their identity. However, categorizing them as marginalized, as per
Berry’s acculturation framework, oversimplifies their complex identity journeys. Their identities were
voluntarily chosen rather than imposed and they both showed contentedness in their position.

Feelings of belonging were crucial in identity formation and it is also the third cross-cutting aspect of
Kartosen’s concept of identification. Most participants feel a strong sense of belonging to the host
society because it is the place they know best, where they were born and raised. Acceptance (or non-
acceptance) from the host society had a lasting impact on participants' sense of belonging, regardless
of their chosen identities. They foresee their own future in the place where they are now and through
constant negotiation aim to strengthen their belonging. One participant felt deeply connected to his
Chinese heritage and migrated to China, highlighting his strong sense of belonging to that culture. It
supports Kartosen’s argument that identity and belonging do not have to be the same. Several
participants questioned the belonging of their parents and the first-generation in general due to the
fact they settled in the host society several decades ago. As one participant explained, her parents had


```
Conclusion and discussion
```
a strong sense of belonging towards the host society and she believes this has influenced her
perception to a great extent, conceivably unconscious.

I gained valuable insights by asking participants about their and the second-generation's future,
especially in terms of raising their own (hypothetical) children differently compared to their own
upbringing. Most participants envisioned their future in the host society, emphasizing a shift toward
Dutch culture for those with hybrid identities. They expressed a desire for a more liberal and open
approach to parenting so their children will not feel different and have a smoother integration. An
important outcome I discovered was that the participants had a common desire to provide their
children with what they believed were lacking during their own upbringing. Even though different
elements are prioritized, it shares close resemblance with the philosophy of the first-generation; to
provide their children with what they themselves lacked during their own upbringing.

The #StopAsianHate protest during the Covid- 19 protest gained empathy from participants, but little
practical action was taken due to the lack of perceived ‘’othering’’ and other negative behavior towards
them. The urban environment and isolation during the pandemic may have contributed to this lack of
exposure. Participants did not feel compelled to speak up and preferred to remain in the background
and avoid conflicts. It appeared a more individual approach is adopted in shaping and negotiating
identity and belonging. However, many felt empowered by the protest, believing second-generation
Chinese are well integrated into host society.

I interviewed Oscar, host and creator of Yang’s Voices Podcast, who aims to increase media
representation for the Chinese and Asian community, hoping to take away common stereotypes. He
urged for the second-generation to talk openly with others from the community about problems
related to integration, identity and belonging. He approves the #StopAsianHate protests and hopes
second-generation individuals will continue to speak up, fearing that negative stereotypes would
otherwise continue to exist. Another interview was conducted with Amy, chairwoman of Asian Raisins.
The organization represents ‘’OZOA people’’ (Oost en Zuid-Oost Aziatische), which is an acronym for
people with an East and South-East Asian descent. OZOA people often face similar ‘’othering’’ behavior
towards them. According to Amy, this group lacks acknowledgement from the public about its social
issues. The lack of government initiated and funded research leads to little attention to this group in
policymaking and eventually, exclusion to society. She hopes OZOA people will actively speak up
against any form of discrimination, in order to claim a place in society.


```
Conclusion and discussion
```
When looking at my participants, they did not perceive a strong difference between a pre- and post-
Covid-19 society, which is what I initially was set out to explore. Nevertheless, the importance of
identity and belonging has been demonstrated. For myself, it was an eye-opening experience to
explore the narratives from other second-generation individuals. I discovered many similarities with
myself, such as the hybrid identity adopted and the tiger parenting phenomenon. I experienced a sense
of solidarity with the participants, rooted from the same background we share. For immigrant groups,
the subject bears social importance, since a better understanding can be made in how a group
perceives itself in the host society and how the acculturation process is taking place. The many
immigrant groups in the Netherlands each have their own background and narrative. Especially for
second-generation individuals, I believe there is a strong willingness to be part of society, no matter
what he or she self-identifies with. My research did not make many comparisons with other immigrant
groups in the Netherlands due to a large focus on my target group. On several occasions however, I
did detect that the model minority stereotype ascribed to the second-generation Chinese is a different
stereotype compared to the treatment of other immigrant groups.

If the aim is to shape an inclusive society, qualitative research on immigrant groups can help the
acculturation process since an attempt is made to understand one another, which is another
dimension compared to statistical data from quantitative research. Through interchangeable
application of several concepts and theories, I researched a group that is underrepresented in the
literature. For example, Berry’s acculturation framework has been adopted, but no existing literature
has applied this to second-generation Chinese Dutch before. In this framework, I discovered several
generalizations that were flawed and could not be applied to my participants directly. Such as the
marginalization strategy, implying low self-esteem and mental health of the individual, did not apply
to my participants. Also, the majority of the literature has a focus on first-generation immigrants, which
is where my research can make a contribution and add knowledge from an often forgotten group; the
second-generation. Lastly, I would like to emphasize the model minority stereotype second-generation
Chinese are often confronted with, which highlights the expectations imposed on them from the host
society and their home culture. In this environment, my participants often claim a hybrid identity,
where they have the possibility to adopt what they deem meaningful from both cultures. The
stereotypes are notions of ‘’othering’’, obstructing the second-generation to completely be accepted
within society.
