## Accompaniment 
## 陪伴

Loren Eiseley, an American naturalist, was doing some ﬁeldwork on the Platte River, which runs through Mary Pipher’s Nebraska and then ﬂows into the Missouri and eventually down into the Gulf of Mexico. He was trekking through thick brush when suddenly he broke through a willow thicket and found himself standing ankle-deep in the river, his feet drenched. He was hot and thirsty after miles of walking and there was no one around, so he took oﬀ his clothes and sat down in the water.<br/>
洛伦·艾斯利（Loren Eiseley），一位美国博物学家，当时正在普法尔（Mary Pipher）的内布拉斯加州的普拉特河（Platte River）进行实地考察。普拉特河穿过内布拉斯加，流入密苏里河，最终汇入墨西哥湾。他在茂密的灌木丛中跋涉，突然间他冲破了一片柳树丛，发现自己站在齐脚踝深的河水中，脚已经湿透了。经过数英里的行走，他感到炎热和口渴，周围没有人，于是他脱掉衣服，坐在水中。

At that moment, he experienced what he called an “extension of the senses,” an awareness that this river he was immersed in was a part of the whole North American watershed, starting with the cold little streams in snow- covered glaciers and ﬂowing south into mighty rivers and then into oceans, and that he, too, was part of this vast ﬂow. A thought came to him: “I was going to ﬂoat.” <br/>
在那一刻，他体验到了他所谓的“感官延伸”，意识到他所浸泡的这条河是整个北美流域的一部分，这流域从被雪覆盖的冰川中的寒冷小溪开始，向南流入巨大的河流，最终流入海洋，而他自己也是这浩瀚水流的一部分。他心中浮现一个念头：“我要漂浮起来了。”

If you know anything about the Platte River, you know the saying that the Platte is a mile wide and an inch deep.It’s a shallow river, about knee-deep where Eiseley was. But to him, this was no trivial depth. For he did not know how to swim. A childhood near-death experience had given him a permanent fear of water, and the Platte, while shallow, does have its swirls, holes, and patches of quicksand, so the thought of ﬂoating in it came wrapped in fear, nervousness, and exhilaration.<br/>
如果你对普拉特河有所了解，你会知道有句俗语说普拉特河宽一英里，深一英寸。这是一条浅河，艾斯利所在的地方大约齐膝深。但对他来说，这并非浅显的深度。因为他不会游泳。一次童年时的濒死经历让他对水有了永久的恐惧，尽管普拉特河很浅，但它确实有漩涡、深洞和一片片流沙，因此漂浮在河中的念头既伴随着恐惧和紧张，也夹杂着兴奋。

Still, he lay on his back on the water and began to drift, savoring the sensation of it, asking, What does it feel like to be a river? He was washing away the boundaries between himself and the river he was now part of. “The sky wheeled over me. For an instant, as I bobbed into the main channel, I had the sensation of sliding down the vast tilted face of the continent. It was then that I felt cold needles of the alpine springs at my ﬁngertips, and the warmth of the Gulf pulling me southward,” he wrote later. “I was streaming over ancient sea-beds thrust aloft where giant reptiles had once sported; I was wearing down the face of time and trundling cloud-wreathed ranges into oblivion. I touched my margins with the delicacy of a crayﬁsh’s antennae, and felt great ﬁshes glide about their work.” <br/>
然而，他仍然仰卧在水面上，开始漂流，享受这种感觉，问自己：“做一条河是什么感觉？”他正在抹去自己与他现在身处的这条河之间的界限。“天空在我上方旋转。就在我漂进主河道的瞬间，我有一种滑落在大陆巨大倾斜面的感觉。那时，我感受到阿尔卑斯山泉的冰冷针刺在我的指尖，而墨西哥湾的温暖在拉扯着我南下，”他后来写道。“我在古代海床上流淌，那里曾有巨型爬行动物嬉戏；我正在侵蚀时间的面貌，将被云雾环绕的山脉推向遗忘。我用小龙虾触角般的敏感触及我的边缘，感受到大鱼们在忙碌地滑行。”

Eiseley’s essay about this experience is called “The Flow of the River.” In it, he’s not only describing the Platte; he’s describing how he felt he was merging with the river. He recounts a sort of open awareness of the connections between all creatures, all nature. He wasn’t swimming in the river. He wasn’t investigating the river. He was accompanying the river.<br/>
艾斯利关于这段经历的文章叫做《河流的流动》。在其中，他不仅描述了普拉特河，还描述了他觉得自己在与河流融合的感受。他叙述了一种对所有生物、所有自然之间联系的开放意识。他不是在河中游泳，也不是在探究河流。他是在与河流相伴。

After the illuminating gaze, accompaniment is the next step in getting to know a person.<br/>
在启发性的注视之后，陪伴是了解一个人的下一步。

Ninety percent of life is just going about your business. It’s a meeting at work, a trip to the supermarket, or small talk with another parent while dropping the kids oﬀ at school. And usually there are other people around. In these normal moments of life, you’re not staring deeply into another’seyes or unveiling profound intimacies. You’re just doing stuﬀ together—not face-to-face but side by side. You are accompanying each other.<br/>
生活中的九成时间只是忙于日常事务。这可能是一次工作会议，一趟超市之旅，或在送孩子上学时与另一位家长的闲聊。通常周围还有其他人。在这些平凡的生活时刻，你不会深情地凝视别人的眼睛或揭示深刻的亲密关系。你们只是一起做一些事情——不是面对面，而是肩并肩。你们是在相伴而行。

When you’re ﬁrst getting to know someone, you don’t want to try to peer into their souls right away. It’s best to look at something together. What do you think of the weather, Taylor Swift, gardening, or the TV series The Crown? You’re not studying a person, just getting used to them. Through small talk and doing mundane stuﬀ together your unconscious mind is moving with mine and we’re getting a sense of each other’s energy, temperament, and manner. We’re attuning with each other’s rhythms and moods and acquiring a kind of subtle, tacit knowledge about each other that is required before other kinds of knowledge can be broached. We’re becoming comfortable with each other, and comfort is no small thing. Nothing can be heard in the mind until the situation feels safe and familiar to the body.<br/>
当你初次认识一个人时，你不会想立刻就试图窥视他们的灵魂。最好是一起看点什么。你怎么看待天气、泰勒·斯威夫特、园艺或电视剧《王冠》？你不是在研究一个人，只是在习惯他们。通过闲聊和一起做平凡的事情，你的潜意识在与我的潜意识互动，我们在感受彼此的能量、性情和举止。我们在协调彼此的节奏和情绪，获取一种微妙的、默契的知识，这种知识是在接触其他类型的知识之前所必需的。我们在彼此之间变得舒适，而舒适感并非小事。除非身体感觉情况安全且熟悉，否则心智无法听到任何声音。<br/>

Small talk and just casually being around someone is a vastly underappreciated stage in the process of getting to know someone. Sometimes you can learn more about a person by watching how they talk to a waiter than by asking some profound question about their philosophy of life. Even when you know someone well, I ﬁnd that if you don’t talk about the little things on a regular basis, it’s hard to talk about the big things.<br/>
闲聊和随意地与某人在一起是知悉一个人过程中极为被低估的阶段。有时候，通过观察一个人如何与服务员交谈，比问一些关于他们人生哲学的深刻问题更能了解这个人。即使是你非常了解的人，我发现如果你不经常谈论琐碎，就很难谈论大事情。

This chapter is about how to get to know people a bit better during the daily routines of everyday life. There are ways of showing up that deepen connection and trust, and ways that do not. If you go through life with an eﬀiciency/optimization mindset, you’re just going to drop oﬀ your kids at nursery school in the shortest time possible and you and the other parents will be ships passing in the night. But I believe that Eiseley’s ﬂoat down the river gives us a diﬀerent model for how to be present with other people.<br/>
本章讲述如何在日常生活的琐事中更好地了解人们。有些方式能加深连接和信任，而有些则不能。如果你以效率/优化的心态过生活，你会以最快的速度把孩子送到幼儿园，然后你和其他家长就像夜里擦肩而过的船只。但我相信，艾斯利在河中漂流的经历为我们提供了一种与他人共处的不同模式。

Obviously, ﬂoating down a river is not the same as being in a meeting with someone or having coﬀee with an acquaintance. But there is something about Eiseley’s attitude that is instructive and inspiring. Accompaniment, in this meaning, is an other-centered way of moving through life. When you’re accompanying someone, you’re in a state of relaxed awareness—attentive and sensitive and unhurried. You’re not leading or directing the other person. You’re just riding alongside as they experience the ebbs and ﬂows of daily life. You’re there to be of help, a faithful presence, open to whatever may come. Your movements are marked not by willfulness but by willingness—you’re willing to let the relationship deepen or not deepen, without forcing it either way. You are acting in a way that lets other people be perfectly themselves.<br/>
显然，顺河漂流和与某人开会或与熟人喝咖啡并不相同。但艾斯利的态度中有某些值得借鉴和启发的地方。陪伴，在这个意义上，是一种以他人为中心的生活方式。当你陪伴某人时，你处于一种放松的觉知状态——专注、敏感且不慌不忙。你不是在引导或指挥对方。你只是与他们一起经历日常生活的起伏。你在那里是为了帮助他们，成为一个忠诚的存在，敞开胸怀迎接任何可能发生的事情。你的行为不是由意志力驱动，而是由意愿驱动——你愿意让关系深化或不深化，而不是强迫它向某个方向发展。你以一种让他人完全做自己的方式行事。

The ﬁrst quality I associate with accompaniment is patience. Trust is built slowly. The person who is good at accompaniment exercises what the philosopher Simone Weil called “negative eﬀort.” This is the ability to hold back and be aware of the other person’s timetable. “We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them but by waiting for them,” Weil wrote. The person who is good at accompaniment is decelerating the pace of social life. I know a couple who treasure friends who are what they call “lingerable.” They are the sort of people you want to linger with at the table after a meal or in chairs outside by the pool, to let things ﬂow, to let the relationship emerge. It’s a great talent—to be someone others consider lingerable.<br/>
我将陪伴联系在一起的第一个品质是耐心。信任是慢慢建立起来的。善于陪伴的人践行的是哲学家西蒙娜·薇依所称的“消极努力”。这是指能够克制自己，并意识到对方的时间表。薇依写道：“我们并不通过寻找得到最珍贵的礼物，却是通过等待他们（降临）。”善于陪伴的人减缓了社交生活的节奏。我认识一对夫妇，他们珍视那些他们称之为“适合流连”的朋友。这些人是那种在饭后你想与之在餐桌旁或泳池边的椅子上流连的人，让事情自然地展开，让关系自然地涌现。这是一种巨大的才能——成为别人认为值得流连的人。

Getting to know someone else is always going to be a vulnerable proposition. Personal truths resent approaches that are too aggressive, too intense, too impatient. People rightly guard their own psychological space and erect gates that can be passed through only in their own good time. Before a person is going to be willing to share personal stuﬀ, they have to know that you respect their personal stuﬀ. They have to know that you see their reserve as a form of dignity, their withholding as a sign that they respect themselves.<br/>
了解另一个人总是一种脆弱的提议。个人的真相对过于咄咄逼人、过于强烈、过于急躁的方式有所反感。人们理所当然地保护自己的心理空间，并建立起只有在适当时候才能通过的门槛。在一个人愿意分享个人事务之前，他们必须知道你尊重他们的个人事务。他们必须知道你把他们的保留视为一种尊严的表现，把他们的隐瞒视为他们尊重自己的标志。

Accompaniment is a necessary stage in getting to know a person precisely because it is so gentle and measured. As D. H. Lawrence put it: <br/>
陪伴是准确认识一个人必不可少的阶段，正因为它如此温和和审慎。正如D.H.劳伦斯所说：

Whoever wants life must go softly towards life, softly as one would go towards a deer and fawn that are nestling under a tree. One gesture of violence, one violent assertion of self-will and life is gone….But with quietness, with an abandon of self-assertion and a fullness of the deep true self one can approach another human being, and know the delicate best of life, the touch.<br/>
任何一个渴望生活的人，必须轻柔地走向生活，像走向一只躲在树下的鹿和小鹿一样。一个暴力的姿态，一个自我意志的猛烈宣示，生活就消失了……但是，通过安静，通过放弃自我宣示和一个深度真实自我的圆满性，一个人可以接近另一个人类存有，体会到生活中最微妙的美好，那个触碰。

The next quality of accompaniment is playfulness. When Eiseley was ﬂoating down that river, he wasn’t wearing his scientiﬁc hat. He was oﬀ on a lark. He was playing, enjoying an activity he found spontaneous and fun. When the hosts of retreats and workshops want the participants to get to know each other quickly, they encourage them to play together—whether by means of croquet, cards, music,charades, taking a walk, arts and crafts, or even ﬂoating down a river.<br/>
陪伴的下一个品质是玩乐。当艾斯利在河中漂浮时，他并没有戴上科学家的帽子。他是在寻找乐趣。他在玩耍，享受他发现自发且有趣的活动。当静修和工作坊的主持人希望参与者快速了解彼此时，他们鼓励他们一起玩耍——无论是通过槌球、纸牌、音乐、哑剧、散步、艺术手工，甚至是一起在河中漂浮。

We do this because people are more fully human when they are at play. As the essayist Diane Ackerman notes in her book Deep Play, play isn’t an activity; it’s a state of mind.<br/>
我们这样做是因为人在玩耍时更能展现其完整的人性。正如散文作家黛安·阿克曼在她的书《深度玩乐》中指出的那样，玩耍不是一种活动，而是一种心态。

For some, tennis is work. They’re locked in that achievement mentality, trying to make progress toward some proﬁciency goal. But for others, tennis is play—a movement that feels fun and absorbing in itself. Their whole manner is loose; they celebrate happily when they hit a good volley, cheer when their opponent does. For some, science is work—winning status and getting grants.<br/>
对一些人来说，网球是工作。他们被锁定在那种成就心态中，试图在某个熟练目标上取得进步。但对另一些人来说，网球是玩耍——一种本身就觉得有趣和吸引人的运动。他们的整个姿态是放松的，当他们打出一个好球时会高兴地庆祝，当对手打得好时会欢呼。对一些人来说，科学是工作——赢得地位和获得资助。

But I know an astronomer for whom science is play. When she’s talking about black holes or distant galaxies, she sounds like an eleven-year-old bubbling over with excitement: She’s got these cool telescopes and she gets to look at cool things! <br/>
但我认识一位把科学当作玩乐的天文学家。当她谈论黑洞或遥远的星系时，她听起来就像一个充满兴奋的十一岁孩子：她拥有这些酷炫的望远镜，可以看到非常有趣的东西！

When I’m playing basketball with my friends, the quality of our game may be wanting, but we’re at play and it brings us together. We’re coordinating movements. We’re passing the ball to each other and weaving in and out, trying to get open. There’s a kind of spontaneous communication: the cheering, the high ﬁves, the strategizing, the trash talk. I know some guys who’ve been in a monthly basketball game together for years. They may never have had a deep conversation, but they’d lay down their lives for one another, so deep are the bonds between them—bonds that were formed by play.<br/>
当我和朋友们一起打篮球时，我们的比赛质量可能不尽如人意，但我们在比赛中团结一致。我们协调动作。我们互相传球，穿梭于球场内外，试图突破防守。这是一种自发的交流：欢呼、击掌、制定策略、垃圾话。我认识一些多年来每月都会一起打篮球的人。他们可能从未进行过深入的交谈，但他们愿意为彼此献出生命，他们之间的纽带是如此深厚——这种纽带是通过比赛建立起来的。

In the midst of play, people relax, become themselves, and connect without even trying. Laughter is not just what comes after jokes. Laughter happens when our minds come together and something unexpected happens: We feel the ping of common recognition. We laugh to celebrate our shared understanding. We see each other.<br/>
在玩耍的过程中，人们放松下来，成为真正的自己，并不自觉地建立联系。笑声不仅仅是玩笑之后的反应。笑声发生在我们的思想交汇、意外情况出现时：我们感受到共同认知的共鸣。我们笑着庆祝彼此间的共同理解。我们看见了对方。

In her memoir Let’s Take the Long Way Home, the writer Gail Caldwell describes how her deep friendship with a woman named Caroline was formed. It happened during play, either rowing sculls on the Charles River in Boston or going out in the woods to train their dogs together. Gail and Caroline would spend hours working with their dogs, dissecting the diﬀerent meanings the word “no” can have when spoken to a canine. “If the two of us had had our trust shaken in lousy relationships, it was being rebuilt here, with tools we hadn’t quite been aware we possessed,” she writes. “For us, dog training was a shared experience of such reward that the education was infused throughout the friendship. Much of training a dog is instinctive; it is also a complex eﬀort of patience and observation and mutual respect.” Through the rhythms of this kind of play, Gail and Caroline passed through a series of intimacy gradients. They went from “mutual caution to inseparable ease, and so much of it now seems like a careful, even silent exchange.” <br/>
在她的回忆录《绕远路回家》中，作家盖尔·考德威尔描述了她与一位名叫卡罗琳的女性之间深厚友谊的形成。那是在玩耍中发生的，不管是一起在波士顿的查尔斯河上划单人艇，还是在树林中一起训练她们的狗。盖尔和卡罗琳会花上几个小时与狗一起工作，剖析对狗说“不”这个词可以有的不同含义。她写道：“如果我们两人在糟糕的关系中失去了信任，它正在这里重建，用我们未曾意识到拥有的工具。”“对我们来说，训练狗是一个共享的体验，充满了回报，这种教育渗透在整个友谊中。训练狗的很多部分是本能的，同时也是一种复杂的耐心、观察和相互尊重的努力。”通过这种玩耍的节奏，盖尔和卡罗琳经历了一系列亲密关系的梯度。她们从“相互谨慎到形影不离的轻松，现在看来这一切似乎都是一种细致，甚至是无声的交流。”


It’s amazing how much you can come to know someone, even before any deep conversations happen. When my oldest son was an infant, he woke up every morning at around four. At the time, we were living in Brussels, where it doesn’t get light in wintertime until almost nine. So I’d have four or ﬁve hours each morning in the dark to play—to bounce him on my chest, to run his wooden trains, to tickle him and laugh. One day as I was lying on the couch, holding his hands, and he was bouncing on my stomach with his shaky legs, it occurred to me that I knew him best of any person on the planet, and that of all the people on the planet, he probably knew me best, because while innocently playing with him I’d been so emotionally open and spontaneous. It also occurred to me that though we knew each other so well, we had never had a conversation, because he could not yet talk. All of our communication was through play, touch, and glance.<br/>
你会发现，即使在没有进行任何深入对话之前，你也能了解一个人很多。当我的大儿子还是婴儿时，他每天早上四点左右醒来。那时，我们住在布鲁塞尔，冬天的天亮得很晚，要到将近九点才会亮。所以每个早晨，我都会在黑暗中度过四五个小时，与他玩耍——把他放在我的胸口上颠着，推着他的木制小火车，挠他痒痒，一起笑。有一天，当我躺在沙发上，握着他的手，他用颤抖的双腿在我的肚子上蹦跳时，我突然意识到，我对他的了解比对地球上任何一个人都深，而在地球上所有的人中，他可能对我的了解最深，因为在与他天真地玩耍时，我是如此情感开放和自发。我还意识到，虽然我们彼此了解得如此之深，但我们从未进行过一次对话，因为他还不会说话。我们所有的交流都是通过玩耍、触摸和目光完成的。

The third quality of accompaniment I should mention is the other-centeredness of it. Eiseley wasn’t thinking about himself or his ego in that river. He was partially losing his self and transcending his ego. He was letting the river lead.<br/>
陪伴的第三个品质是以他人为中心。艾斯利在那条河里并没有想着自己或自己的自我。他部分地失去了自我，超越了自我。他让河流引领他。

In normal life, when you’re accompanying someone, you’re signing on to another person’s plan. We’re most familiar with the concept of accompaniment in the world of music. The pianist accompanies the singer. They are partners, making something together, but the accompanist is in the supportive role, subtly working to embellish the beauty of the song and help the singer shine. The accompanist is sensitive to what the singer is doing, begins to get a feel for the experience she is trying to create. Accompaniment is a humble way of being a helpful part of another’s journey, as they go about making their own kind of music.
在日常生活中，当你陪伴某人时，你是在参与另一个人的计划。我们对音乐世界中的陪伴概念最为熟悉。钢琴师为歌手伴奏。他们是合作伙伴，共同创作，但伴奏者扮演辅助角色，巧妙地修饰歌曲的美感并帮助歌手大放异彩。伴奏者对歌手的所作所为很敏感，开始感受到她试图创造的体验。伴奏是一种谦逊地成为他人旅程中有益的一部分的方式，正如同帮助他们创作自己的音乐。

The accompanist is not controlling the journey, but neither is she a passive bystander. Let me try to illustrate this delicate balance by describing a time when I screwed it up, drawn from the mundane circumstances of everyday life. My two sons both played baseball at a high level. One boy is eight years older than the other, so by the time the younger was about twelve, I’d been around youth baseball for about a decade, watching the professional coaches the league had hired to manage the older boy’s squads. My younger son’s coach on his club team that year was another dad, not a pro, and I volunteered to assist. It quickly became clear, at least to me, that I knew a lot more about coaching youth baseball than the coach, simply because I had a lot more experience around the sport.<br/>
伴奏者并不是在控制这段旅程，但她也不是一个被动的旁观者。让我试着通过描述一次我搞砸了的经历来说明这种微妙的平衡，这取自日常生活中的平凡情况。我的两个儿子都在高水平打棒球。一个儿子比另一个大八岁，所以到小儿子大约十二岁时，我已经在青少年棒球圈子里混了大约十年，观看联盟雇佣的职业教练管理大儿子的球队。那一年，小儿子俱乐部球队的教练是另一个父亲，不是职业教练，我自愿去帮忙。很快，至少在我看来，很明显我比教练更懂青少年棒球的教练工作，只是因为我在这项运动上有更多的经验。

So I began peppering him with my genius ideas about how to run practice, throw batting practice, make mid- game adjustments. Obviously, this was purely a case of selﬂess me being of service to the team. Obviously, it wasn’t about any latent desire to show how much I knew, or to attract attention, or to be in control. Obviously, my behavior could have had nothing to do with the male ego in the presence of competitive sports.<br/>
于是，我开始用我那些关于如何进行训练、打击练习、在比赛中期做出调整的天才想法不断地向他建议。显然，这纯粹是出于我无私地为球队服务的意图。显然，这与我想展示自己知道多少、吸引注意力或想掌控一切的潜在欲望无关。显然，我的行为与在竞争性体育运动中的男性自尊心毫无关系。

The coach immediately sensed that I was getting inside his zone and threatening his authority. So of course his defensive walls went up. What could have been our mutual play with the boys turned into a subtle rivalry for power. Our relationship, which could have been warm, because he was a good guy, cooled. He rarely accepted the brilliant pointers I was oﬀering.<br/>
教练很快察觉到我正在进入他的领域，威胁到他的权威。所以，当然他立起了防御墙。我们本可以与孩子们共同玩耍的场景，变成了微妙的权力争夺。我们本可以温暖的关系——因为他是个好人——变得冷淡。他很少接受我提供的那些精彩建议。

If I’d been better schooled back then in the art of accompaniment, I would have understood how important it is to honor another person’s ability to make choices. I hope I would have understood, as good accompanists do, that everybody is in their own spot, on their own pilgrimage, and your job is to meet them where they are, help them chart their own course. I wish I had followed some advice that is rapidly becoming an adage: Let others voluntarily evolve. I wish I had understood then that trust is built when individual diﬀerences are appreciated, when mistakes are tolerated, and when one person says, more with facial expressions than anything else, “I’ll be there when you want me. I’ll be there when the time is right.” <br/>
如果当时我对陪伴的艺术有更好的理解，我会明白尊重他人选择能力的重要性。我希望我能像优秀的伴奏者那样理解，每个人都在自己的位置上，进行自己的朝圣之旅，而你的工作是与他们相遇，帮助他们绘制自己的航线。我希望我当时能遵循一些迅速成为谚语的建议：让他人自愿地成长。我希望我那时明白，信任是在欣赏个体差异、容忍错误的时候建立的，当一个人，更多是用面部表情而非任何其他东西，说：“在你想见我的时刻，我便会出现。当时机正确时，我会在那儿。”  <br/> _文艺版本：“君心欲我，我即现身；天时若至，我必伴君。”_

Accompaniment often involves a surrender of power that is beautiful to behold. A teacher could oﬀer the answers, but he wants to walk with his students as they ﬁgure out how to solve a problem. A manager could give orders, but sometimes leadership means assisting employees as they become masters of their own task. A writer could blast out her opinions, but writers are at their best not when they tell people what to think but when they provide a context within which others can think. Pope Paul VI said it wonderfully: “Modern man listens more willingly to witnesses than teachers, and if he does listen to teachers, it’s because they are witnesses.” <br/>
陪伴往往意味着权力的放弃，这是很美妙的事情。教师可以直接给出答案，但他希望与学生们一同走过他们解决问题的过程。经理可以发布命令，但有时领导力意味着帮助员工成为自己任务的主人。作家可以宣扬自己的观点，但作家最出色的时候不是告诉人们该怎么想，而是提供一个让别人思考的背景。教皇保罗六世说得很好：“现代人更愿意听见证者而非教师，如果他们听教师的话，那是因为这些教师也是见证者。”

Finally, a person who is good at accompaniment understands the art of presence. Presence is about showing up. Showing up at weddings and funerals, and especially showing up when somebody is grieving or has been laid oﬀ or has suﬀered some setback or humiliation. When someone is going through a hard time, you don’t need to say some wise thing; you just have to be there, with heightened awareness of what they are experiencing at that moment.<br/>
最后，一个善于陪伴的人理解“在场”的艺术。在场意味着现身。现身于婚礼和葬礼，尤其是在有人悲伤、被解雇、经历挫折或屈辱的时候出现。当有人经历艰难时，你不需要说什么充满智慧的话；你只需要在那里，敏锐地感知他们当时的感受。

I recently read about a professor named Nancy Abernathy who was teaching ﬁrst-year med students, leading a seminar on decision-making skills, when her husband, at age ﬁfty, died of a heart attack while cross- country skiing near their Vermont home. With some diﬀiculty, she managed to make it through the semester and carried on with her teaching. One day she mentioned to the class that she was dreading teaching the same course the next year, because each year, during one of the ﬁrst sessions of the course, she asks everybody to bring in family photos so they can get to know one another. She wasn’t sure if she could share a photo of her late husband during that session without weeping.<br/>
我最近读到一位名叫南希·艾伯纳西的教授的故事。她在教授一年级医学生，领导一个关于决策技能的研讨会时，她的丈夫在佛蒙特州家附近越野滑雪时因心脏病发作去世，享年五十岁。她艰难地坚持完成了这个学期的教学。一天，她向班上提到自己对来年教同样的课程感到畏惧，因为每年在课程的最初几节课中，她都会让大家带来家庭照片以便彼此了解。她不确定自己能否在那一节课上分享已故丈夫的照片而不哭泣。

The course ended. Summer came and went, and fall arrived and, with it, the day she dreaded. The professor entered the lecture hall, full of trepidation, and sensed something strange: The room was too full. Sitting there, along with her current class, were the second-year students, the ones who had taken her class the year before. They had come simply to lend their presence during this hard session. They knew exactly what she needed, and didn’t need to oﬀer anything more. “This is compassion,” Abernathy later remarked. “A simple human connection between the one who suﬀers and one who would heal.”<br/>
课程结束了。夏天来了又去，秋天到了，带来了她畏惧的一天。教授带着不安进入讲堂，感觉到一些奇怪的气氛：教室里人太多了。坐在那里的是她当年的学生，他们来只是为了在这艰难的一节课上给予她支持。他们准确地知道她需要什么，而不需要提供更多。“这就是仁慈，”艾伯纳西后来评论道。“一个受苦的人和一个愿意治愈的人之间简单的人性连接。”

When I was teaching at Yale, I had a student, Gillian Sawyer, whose father died of pancreatic cancer. Before he died, she and her father talked about the fact that he would miss her major life events—a wedding she might have someday, her children growing up. After he died, she was the bridesmaid at a friend’s wedding. The father of the bride gave a beautiful speech about his daughter’s curiosity and spirit. When it came time for the father-daughter dance, Gillian excused herself to go to the restroom and have a cry. As she emerged, she saw that all the people from her table, many of them friends from college, were standing there by the door. She gave me permission to quote from her paper describing this moment: “What I will remember forever is that no one said a word. I am still amazed at the profoundness that can echo in silence. Each person, including newer boyfriends who I knew less well, gave me a reaﬀirming hug in turn and headed back to their seats. No one lingered or awkwardly tried to validate my grief. They were there for me, just for a moment, and it was exactly what I needed.” <br/>
当我在耶鲁教书时，有一位学生，吉莉安·索耶，她的父亲死于胰腺癌。在他去世之前，她和父亲谈论了他将错过她的重要人生事件——可能有一天的婚礼，她孩子的成长。父亲去世后，她在朋友的婚礼上担任伴娘。新娘的父亲发表了一篇关于女儿好奇心和精神的美丽演讲。当父女舞时间到来时，吉莉安借口去洗手间哭了一会儿。当她出来时，她看到桌上的所有人，许多是大学的朋友，都站在门边。她允许我引用她的文章来描述这一时刻：“我将永远记得的是，没有人说一句话。我仍然对沉默中回响的深刻感到惊讶。每个人，包括那些我不太熟悉的新男朋友，依次给了我一个真切坚定的拥抱，然后回到座位上。没有人逗留或尴尬地试图确认(触碰)我的悲伤。他们在那里，为我存在的片刻，这正是我所需要的。”

In his book Consolations, the essayist and poet David Whyte observed that the ultimate touchstone of friendship “is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self, the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.” <br/>
散文家和诗人戴维·怀特在他的书《安慰》中观察到，友谊的最终试金石“不是改善，既不是对方也不是自我，最终的试金石是见证，被人看到的特权和被授予看到他人本质的同等特权，与他们同行，相信他们，有时只是陪伴他们一段无法独自完成的旅程。” 被某人看见的特权，以及平等地被赋予了能够看见另一个人本质的特权，是曾经与他们同行，并且曾经相信于他们，有时只是陪伴他们，无论多短暂，在一段不可能独自完成的旅程上。”

Loren Eiseley, during his ﬂoat down the Platte River, models for us a way of accompaniment in the natural environment. I’ve tried to capture his attitude during that ﬂoat and show how it can inspire a way of being in the social environment. Eiseley’s core point in his essay describing that event is that everything in nature is connected with everything else, and that you can understand this if you simply lie back and let that awareness wash over you. In social life, too, everybody is connected to everybody else by our shared common humanity. Sometimes we need to hitch a ride on someone else’s journey, and accompany them a part of the way.<br/>
洛伦·艾斯利在漂流普拉特河期间，为我们展示了一种在自然环境中陪伴的方式。我试图捕捉他在漂流中的态度，并展示它如何激发一种在社会环境中存在的方式。艾斯利在描述那次事件的散文中的核心观点是，自然中的一切都与其他事物相连，如果你只是躺下来，让这种意识洗涤你，你就能理解这一点。在社会生活中，每个人也都因我们共同的人性而与他人相连。有时我们需要搭乘别人的旅程，并陪伴他们走一段路。<br/>
