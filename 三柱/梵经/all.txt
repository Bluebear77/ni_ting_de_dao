SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA
```
```
Born on the 8th Sep tem ber, 1887, in the il lus tri ous fam ily
```
of Sage Appayya Dikshitar and sev eral other re nowned saints

and sa vants, Sri Swami Sivananda had a nat u ral flair for a life

de voted to the study and prac tice of Vedanta. Added to this

was an in born ea ger ness to serve all and an in nate feel ing of

unity with all mankind.

```
His pas sion for ser vice drew him to the med i cal ca reer;
```
and soon he grav i tated to where he thought that his ser vice

was most needed. Ma laya claimed him. He had ear lier been

ed it ing a health jour nal and wrote ex ten sively on health prob -

lems. He dis cov ered that peo ple needed right knowl edge most

of all; dis sem i na tion of that knowl edge he es poused as his own

mission.

```
It was di vine dis pen sa tion and the bless ing of God upon
```
man kind that the doc tor of body and mind re nounced his ca reer

and took to a life of re nun ci a tion to qual ify for min is ter ing to the

soul of man. He set tled down at Rishikesh in 1924, prac tised

in tense aus teri ties and shone as a great Yogi, saint, sage and

Jivanmukta.

```
In 1932 Swami Sivananda started the Sivanandashram.
```
In 1936 was born The Di vine Life So ci ety. In 1948 the

Yoga-Vedanta For est Acad emy was or gan ised. Dis sem i na tion

of spir i tual knowl edge and train ing of peo ple in Yoga and

Vedanta were their aim and ob ject. In 1950 Swamiji un der took

a light ning tour of In dia and Cey lon. In 1953 Swamiji con vened

a ‘World Par lia ment of Re li gions’. Swamiji is the au thor of over

300 vol umes and has dis ci ples all over the world, be long ing to

all na tion al i ties, re li gions and creeds. To read Swamiji’s works

is to drink at the Foun tain of Wis dom Su preme. On 14th July,

1963 Swamiji entered Mahasamadhi.

PREFACE
```
It need not be over-emphasised that the Bhrahma Sutras, or the
Nyaya-Prasthana of the triad of In dian Philo soph i cal trea tises hold
su preme sway over the later ra tio nal is tic and scho las tic de vel op -
ments. Right from the mighty brain of Sankara down to the mas ter-in -
tel lects like Sriharsha, Chitsukha and Madhusudana, the main
po lem ics have been oc cu pied with the task of es tab lish ing the doc -
trine of ab so lute Mo nism and re fut ing the views con trary to it, by ap -
peal to logic as well as au thor ity alike, which find their seeds al ready
sown in the Brahma Sutras. The founder of a new re li gious and philo -
soph i cal school had sim ply to write a new com men tary on the Brahma
Sutras so that his view may be ac cepted by the mass of peo ple. Such
is the au thor ity of the Brahma Sutras, the work of Baadarayana.
Com men tar ies there have been many on the Brahma Sutras,
but ei ther they are too short and in suf fi cient to be use ful for a com pre -
hen sive study of the Sutras, or are ex tremely tough and ab struse to
be uti lized by men of or di nary un der stand ing. This work of Swami
Sivananda is of a unique type in it self, un ri valled by any other. This
com men tary is nei ther too short to be use less, nor too ver bose to be
un in tel li gi ble, but fol lows a _via me dia_ course, use ful to one and all,
mainly the spir i tual as pi rants, who want thought, not mere word.
Swamiji has got his own in im i ta ble way of writ ing, which is a
boon to the in quis i tive stu dent on the spir i tual path. All real as pi rants
af ter Truth should pos sess this book, for it is a guide-light that is ca pa -
ble of steer ing them across the sea of ig no rance and doubt.
Swamiji has left noth ing un said that may be use ful to the stu dent
of the Brahma Sutras, and in ad di tion has given use ful in for ma tion
which will not be found in other notes and com men tar ies. The di vi sion
of each Pada into the rel e vant Adhikaranas mark ing at the same time
the num ber of Sutras they con tain, the sub ject mat ter they treat of,
and the ac com pa ni ment of each Su tra by the se rial num ber from the
very be gin ning is for the use and guid ance of the stu dent. An elab o -
rate in tro duc tion pre cedes the work in ad di tion to a short in tro duc tion
and a sum mary of the dif fer ent Adhikaranas pre ced ing each Pada.
These are all a boon to the stu dent of the Brahma Sutras for which the
in com pa ra ble Swamiji has to be eulo gised. Each Su tra also con tains
a word-by-word mean ing and a run ning trans la tion.
More need not be said than that the pro duc tion is a mar vel ous
one. Swamiji has com pleted his an no ta tions on the Prasthanatraya
with his Brahma Sutras. His writ ings are too fa mous to ne ces si tate
fur ther in tro duc tion.
The text of the Brahma Sutras has been in cluded herein to en -
able the read ers to do Svadhyaya and get them by heart for pur pose

of med i ta tion. (^) **—THE DIVINE LIFE SOCIETY**

I pros trate my self be fore that Guru, the Ex is tence, de void of the

I wor ship the great Rishi Vyasa, who is called
Krishna-dvaipayana, who is wor shipped by gods, men and Asuras
alike, who is the form of Vishnu, who is like the light of the ris ing sun to
the dark ness of the im pu ri ties of the age of Kali, who be longs to the
fam ily of Vasishtha, who di vided the Vedas into dif fer ent sec tions,
who is the seed of Dharma, who wrote the Puranas, the Brahma
Sutras, the Mahabharata and the Smriti.

I con tem plate on Sankaracharya, who is seated in Padmasana,
who is tran quil, who is es tab lished in self-re straint, whose glory is like
that of the en emy of Cu pid, who wears the sa cred ashes shin ing on
his fore head, whose smil ing face re sem bles the blossomed lo tus,
who has lo tus-like eyes, whose neck is conch-like, hold ing book in
one hand and in di cat ing Jnana-mudra (with an other hand), who is
adored by the fore most of gods, who gives boons to those who pros -
trate to him.

## BRAHMA SUTRAS



**INTRODUCTION**

Hari Om! Sal u ta tions to Sri Vyasa, the Avatara of Vishnu, the
wise Badarayana and Sri Krishna Dvaipayana.
Vedas con sist of three por tions viz., the Karma Kanda which
deals with sac ri fices or cer e mo nial rites, the Upasana Kanda which
treats of Upasana (wor ship) and the Jnana Kanda which deals with
knowl edge of Brah man. Karma Kanda rep re sents the feet of a man,
Upasana Kanda the heart, and the Jnana Kanda the head. Just as the
head is the most im por tant por tion of a man, so also the Upanishads
which treat of the knowl edge por tion of the Vedas is the head of the
Vedas. Hence it is said to be the Siras (head) of Vedas.
Mimamsa means the in ves ti ga tion or en quiry into the con nected
mean ing of the sa cred texts. Of this Mimamsa two branches have
been re cog nised, the Purva Mimamsa (ear lier) and the Uttara
Mimamsa (the lat ter). The for mer sys tema tises the Karma
Kanda—the por tion of the Veda which per tains to ac tion and sac ri -
fices and which com prises Samhitas and the Brahmanas; the lat ter
sys tema tises the Jnana Kanda i.e., that part of the Vedas which in -
cludes the Aranyaka por tion of the Brahmanas and the Upanishads.
Jaimini is the au thor of the Purva Mimamsa. Sri Vyasa (Badarayana
or Krishna Dvaipayana) the Guru of Jaimini is the au thor of the
Brahma Sutras oth er wise known as Vedanta Sutras. The study of
Brahma Sutras is a syn thetic study of the Upanishads. It treats of the
Vedanta phi los o phy.
The Vedas are eter nal. They were not writ ten by any in di vid ual.
They came out from the breath of Hiranyagarbha (Lord Brahma).
Vedanta is the end or gist of the Vedas. It deals with the knowl edge
por tion. Vedanta is not mere spec u la tion. It is the au then tic re cord of
tran scen den tal ex pe ri ences or di rect and ac tual reali sa tion of the
great Hindu Rishis or seers. Brahma Sutras is the Sci ence of the
Soul.
Sutras are con cise aph o risms. They give the es sence of the ar -
gu ments on a topic. Max i mum of thought is com pressed or con -
densed into these Sutras in as few words as pos si ble. It is easy to
re mem ber them. Great in tel lec tual peo ple only, with reali sa tion, can

com pose Sutras. They are clues or aids to mem ory. They can not be
un der stood with out a lu cid com men tary (Bhashya). The com men tary
also is in need of fur ther elab o rate ex pla na tion. Thus the in ter pre ta -
tions of the Sutras gave rise to var i ous kinds of lit er ary writ ings such
as Vrittis (gloss) and Karikas. The dif fer ent Acharyas (found ers of dif -
fer ent schools of thought) have given their own in ter pre ta tions of the
Sutras to es tab lish their own doc trines. The Bhashya of Sri Sankara
on Brahma Sutras is known as Sariraka Bhashya. His school of
thought is Kevala Advaita. The Bhashya of Sri Ramanuja who
founded the Visishtadvaita School is called Sri Bhashya. The com -
men tary of Sri Nimbarkacharya is known as Vedanta-parijata-
saurabha. Sri Vallabhacharya ex pounded his sys tem of phi los o phy of
Suddhadvaita (pure mo nism) and his com men tary on the Brahma
Sutras is known as Anu Bhashya.
San skrit is very elas tic. It is like Kamadhenu or Kalpataru. You
can milk out of it var i ous kinds of Rasas ac cord ing to your in tel lec tual
cal i bre and spir i tual ex pe ri ences. There fore dif fer ent Acharyas have
built dif fer ent sys tems of thought or cults by in ter pret ing the Sutras in
their own ways and be came found ers of sects. Madhva founded his
own sys tem of Dvaita. The cults of Vishnu known as Bhagavata or
Pancharatra and those of Siva, Pasupata or Mahesvara have in ter -
preted Brahma Sutras in ac cor dance with their own ten ets.
Nimbarkacharya in ter preted the Vedanta sys tem from the stand point
of Bhedabheda-Dvaitadvaita. He was largely in flu enced by the teach -
ings of Bhaskara who flour ished in the first half of the ninth cen tury.
The the ory held by Bhaskara and Nimbarka was held by the an cient
teacher Audulomi. Badarayana him self re fers to this the ory in his
Brahma Sutras.
There are more than four teen com men tar ies on the Brahma
Sutras. Sri Appaya Dikshita ren dered the com men tary of Sri Sankara
more clear by his Parimala, Sri Vachaspati Misra by his work Bhamati
and Sri Amalananda Sarasvati by his Kalpataru.
The er ro ne ous iden ti fi ca tion of the body with the pure At man is
the root cause for hu man suf fer ings and mis er ies and for births and
deaths. You iden tify your self with the body and say, ‘I am fair, dark,
stout or thin. I am a Brah min, I am a Kshatriya, I am a doc tor’. You
iden tify your self with the senses and say, ‘I am blind, I am dumb’. You
iden tify your self with the mind and say, ‘I know noth ing. I know ev ery -
thing. I be came an gry. I en joyed a good meal. I am suf fer ing from this
dis ease’. The en tire ob ject of the Brahma Sutras is to re move this er -
ro ne ous iden ti fi ca tion of the Soul with the body which is the root
cause of your suf fer ings and mis er ies, which is the prod uct of Avidya
(ig no rance) and help you in the at tain ment of the fi nal eman ci pa tion
through knowl edge of Brah man.

```
INTRODUCTION 4
```

The Upanishads seem to be full of con tra dic tions at first. They
do not con tain con sis tent sys tem of thought. Sri Vyasa sys tema tised
the thoughts or phi los o phy of the Upanishads in his Brahma Sutras.
The Sutras rec on cile the con flict ing state ments of the Upanishads. In
re al ity there are no con flicts for the thinker. Audulomi and Asmarathya
also did this work in their own way and founded their own schools of
thought.
Those who wish to study the phi los o phy of Vedanta should
study the Ten Clas si cal Upanishads and the Brahma Sutras. All
Acharyas have com mented on Brahma Sutras. This is a great au thor -
ity for ev ery philo soph i cal school in In dia. If any Acharya wishes to es -
tab lish his own cult or sect or school of thought he will have to write a
com men tary of his own on Brahma Sutras. Then only it will be re cog -
nised.
The five great Acharyas: Sri Sankara the ex po nent of Kevala
Advaita or un com pro mis ing mo nism, Sri Ramanuja the ex po nent of
Visishtadvaita or qual i fied mo nism, Sri Nimbarka the ex po nent of
Bhedabheda-vada, Sri Madhva the ex po nent of strict Dvaitism or
Dvaita-vada and Sri Vallabha the ex po nent of Suddhadvaita-vada or
pure mo nism agree that Brah man is the cause of this world and that
knowl edge of Brah man leads to Moksha or the fi nal eman ci pa tion,
which is the goal of life. They also em phat i cally de clared that Brah -
man can be known only through the scrip tures and not through mere
rea son ing. But they dif fer amongst them selves as to the na ture of this
Brah man, the re la tion of the in di vid ual soul to Brah man, the state of
the soul in the state of fi nal eman ci pa tion, the means of at tain ing It
and Its cau sal ity with ref er ence to this uni verse.
Ac cord ing to Sri Sankara, there is one Ab so lute Brah man who is
Sat-chit-ananda, who is of an ab so lutely ho mo ge neous na ture. The
ap pear ance of this world is due to Maya—the il lu sory power of Brah -
man which is nei ther Sat nor Asat. This world is un real. This world is a
Vivarta or ap par ent mod i fi ca tion through Maya. Brah man ap pears as
this uni verse through Maya. Brah man is the only re al ity. The in di vid -
ual soul has lim ited him self through Avidya and iden ti fi ca tion with the
body and other ve hi cles. Through his self ish ac tions he en joys the
fruits of his ac tions. He be comes the ac tor and enjoyer. He re gards
him self as atomic and as an agent on ac count of Avidya or the lim it ing
Antahkarana. The in di vid ual soul be comes iden ti cal with Brah man
when his Avidya is de stroyed. In re al ity Jiva is all-per vad ing and iden -
ti cal with Brah man. Isvara or Saguna Brah man is a prod uct of Maya.
Wor ship of Isvara leads to Krama Mukti. The pi ous dev o tees (the
knowers of Saguna Brah man) go to Brahmaloka and at tain fi nal re -
lease through high est knowl edge. They do not re turn to this world.
They at tain the Nirguna Brah man at the end of the cy cle. Knowl edge
of Nirguna Brah man is the only means of lib er a tion. The knowers of

5 BRAHMA SUTRAS


Nirguna Brah man at tain im me di ate fi nal re lease or Sadyomukti. They
need not go by the path of gods or the path of Devayana. They merge
them selves in Para Brah man. They do not go to any Loka or world. Sri
Sankara’s Brah man is Nirvisesha Brah man (Im per sonal Ab so lute)
with out at trib utes.
Ac cord ing to Sri Ramanuja, Brah man is with at trib utes
(Savisesha). He is en dowed with all aus pi cious qual i ties. He is not in -
tel li gence it self. In tel li gence is his chief at trib ute. He con tains within
Him self what ever ex ists. World and in di vid ual souls are es sen tial real
con stit u ents of Brah man’s na ture. Mat ter (Achit) and soul (Chit) form
the body of the Lord, Lord Narayana who is the In ner Ruler
(Antaryamin). Mat ter and souls are called modes of Him (Prakara).
The in di vid ual souls will never be en tirely re solved in Brah man. Ac -
cord ing to Ramanuja, Brah man is not ab so lutely one and ho mo ge -
neous. The in di vid ual souls un dergo a state of Sankocha
(con trac tion) dur ing Pralaya. They ex pand (Vikasa) dur ing cre ation.
Sri Ramanuja’s Brah man is a Per sonal God with at trib utes. The in di -
vid ual soul of Ramanuja is re ally in di vid ual. It will re main a per son al ity
for ever. The soul re mains in Vaikuntha for ever in a state of bliss and
en joys the di vine Aisvarya of Lord Narayana. Bhakti is the chief
means to fi nal eman ci pa tion and not Jnana. Sri Ramanuja fol lows in
his Bhashya the au thor ity of Bodhayana.
Ac cord ing to Sri Nimbarkacharya, Brah man is con sid ered as
both the ef fi cient and ma te rial cause of the world. Brah man is both
Nirguna and Saguna. The uni verse is not un real or il lu sory but is a
true man i fes ta tion or Parinama of Brah man. (Sri Ramanuja also
holds this view. He says “Just as milk is trans formed into curd, so also
Brah man has trans formed Him self as this uni verse”). This world is
iden ti cal with and at the same time dif fer ent from Brah man just as the
wave or bub ble is the same and at the same time dif fer ent from wa ter.
The in di vid ual souls are parts of the Su preme Self. They are con -
trolled by the Su preme Be ing. The fi nal sal va tion lies in real is ing the
true na ture of one’s own soul. This can be achieved by Bhakti (de vo -
tion). The in di vid u al ity of the fi nite self (Jivatman) is not dis solved
even in the state of fi nal eman ci pa tion. Sri Ramanuja also holds that
the Jiva as sumes the di vine body of Sri Narayana with four hands and
en joys in Vaikuntha the di vine Aisvarya of the Lord.
You may ask why do such great real ised souls hold dif fer ent
views, why have they started dif fer ent cults or sys tems. The high est
phi los o phy of Sri Sankara which be speaks of the iden tity of the in di -
vid ual soul and the Su preme Soul can not be un der stood by the vast
ma jor ity of per sons. There fore Sri Madhva and Sri Ramanuja started
their Bhakti cult. The dif fer ent schools are dif fer ent rungs in the lad der
of Yoga. The stu dent must place his foot step by step and fi nally reach
the high est peak of per fec tion—the Kevaladvaita reali sa tion of Sri

Sankara. As tem per a ments are dif fer ent, dif fer ent schools are also
nec es sary to suit the taste, ca pac ity, and stage of evo lu tion of the as -
pi rant. There fore all schools and cults are nec es sary. They have got
their own place and scope.
The views of var i ous Acharyas are all true in re spect of the par -
tic u lar as pect of Brah man dealt with by them each in his own way.
Sankara has taken Brah man in His tran scen den tal as pect, while Sri
Ramanuja has taken Him chiefly in His im ma nent as pect. Peo ple
were fol low ing blindly the rit u als dur ing the time of Sri Sankara. When
he was pre par ing his com men tary he had in view the pur pose of com -
bat ing the bane ful ef fects which blind rit u al ism pro duced. He never
con demned self less ser vice or Nishkama Karma Yoga. He con -
demned the per for mance of rit u als with self ish mo tives.
Sankara Bhashya is the old est of all com men tar ies. It up holds
Suddha-Para-Brah man or the Su preme Self of the Upanishads as
some thing su pe rior to other di vine be ings. It pro pounds a very bold
phi los o phy and de clares em phat i cally that the in di vid ual soul is iden ti -
cal with the Su preme Self. Sankara’s philo soph i cal view ac cu rately
rep re sents the mean ing of Badarayana. His ex pla na tions only faith -
fully ren der the in tended mean ing of Sri Vyasa. This is be yond doubt
and dis pute.
Stu dents of Kevaladvaita School of Phi los o phy should study the
Sariraka Bhashya of Sri Sankara which is pro found, sub tle and
unique. It is an au thor ity which leads to the right un der stand ing of the
Brahma Sutras. The best think ers of In dia, Ger many, Amer ica and
Eng land be long to this school. It oc cu pies a high rank in books on phi -
los o phy. Advaita phi los o phy is the most sub lime and the grand est phi -
los o phy of the Hin dus.
You can un der stand the Brahma Sutras if you have a knowl edge
of the twelve clas si cal Upanishads. You can un der stand the sec ond
chap ter if you have a knowl edge of Sankhya, Nyaya, Yoga,
Mimamsa, Vaiseshika Darsana and Buddhistic school, too. All these
schools are re futed here by Sri Sankara. Sri Sankara’s com men tary is
the best com men tary. Dr. Thibaut has trans lated this com men tary into
Eng lish. “Brahma Sutras” is one of the books of Prasthanatraya. This
is an au thor i ta tive book on Hindu Phi los o phy. The work con sists of 4
Adhyayas (chap ters), 16 Padas (sec tions), 223 Adhikaranas (top ics)
and 555 Sutras (aph o risms). The first chap ter (Samanvayadhyaya)
uni fies Brah man, the sec ond (Avirodhadhyaya) re futes other phi los o -
phies, the third (Sadhanadhyaya) deals with prac tice (Sadhana) to at -
tain Brah man and the fourth (Phaladhyaya) treats of fruits of
Self-reali sa tion. Each chap ter con tains four Padas. Each Pada con -
tains Adhikaranas. Each Adhikarana has sep a rate ques tion to dis -
cuss. The first five Adhikaranas of the first chap ter are very, very
im por tant.

INTRODUCTION

The Vedanta Sutras are called “Sariraka Mimamsa” be cause
they deal with Para Brah man, the Sarira (the em bod ied).
In the first chap ter the au thor shows that all the Ve dic texts uni -
formly re fer to Brah man and find their Samanvaya (rec on cil i a tion) in
Him. In the sec ond chap ter, it has been proved that there is no con flict
be tween Vedanta and other Sastras. In the third chap ter the means of
at tain ing Brah man are de scribed. In the fourth chap ter is de scribed
the re sult of at tain ing Brah man.
The Adhikarin (one who is com pe tent to un der stand and study
the Sastra) is one who is of tran quil mind and has the at trib utes of
Sama (qui etude), Dama (self-con trol), etc., is full of faith, is con stantly
en gaged in good thoughts and as so ci ates with the knowers of Truth,
whose heart is pu ri fied by the due dis charge of all du ties, re li gious
and sec u lar, and with out any idea of re ward. The Sambandha is the
de scrip tion of Brah man by this Sastra. The Vishaya or the sub ject
mat ter of this Sastra is the Su preme Brah man who is all pure. The
Prayojana (ne ces sity) of this Sastra is to ob tain reali sa tion of the Su -
preme Brah man, by the re moval of all false no tions that pre vent that
reali sa tion.
This Sastra con sists of sev eral Adhikaranas or top ics or prop o -
si tions. Ev ery prop o si tion con sists of five parts:—(1) The sis or

In the whole book of the Vedanta Sutras Brah man is the main
theme or the sub ject mat ter of dis cus sion. An in ter pre ta tion of any
pas sage must not go away from the sub ject mat ter of Brah man. Each
chap ter has a par tic u lar topic of its own. A pas sage must be in ter -
preted con sis tently with the topic of that chap ter. There is a cer tain re -
la tion be tween Adhikaranas or top ics them selves. One Adhikarana
leads to an other through some par tic u lar as so ci a tion of ideas. In a
Pada or sec tion there are many Adhikaranas and they are not put to -
gether in a hap haz ard man ner.

**SYNOPSIS**
This sec tion gives a bird’s-eye view of the sub ject dealt with in
the Brahma Sutras namely the na ture of the Su preme Brah man or the
High est Self, of the in di vid ual soul and the uni verse and their inter-re -
la tions and gives hints on med i ta tion on Brah man.
_Adhikarana I:_ Su tra 1 gives a hint that the book is meant for
those who are en dowed with a real de sire for at tain ing the knowl edge
of Brah man.
_Adhikarana II:_ Su tra 2 de fines Brah man as that whence the
world orig i nates etc.
_Adhikarana III:_ Su tra 3 de clares that Brah man is the source of
the Vedas and that Brah man is known only by the study of Sruti and
by no other means of knowl edge.
_Adhikarana IV:_ Su tra 4 proves Brah man to be the uni form topic
of all Vedanta texts.
_Adhikarana V:_ Sutras 5 to 11 show that none but Brah man is ad -
mit ted by Sruti to be the cause of the world. They prove by var i ous co -
gent and con vinc ing ar gu ments that the Brah man which the Vedantic
texts pro claim as the cause of the uni verse is an in tel li gent prin ci ple,
and can not be iden ti fied with the non-in tel li gent or in sen tient
Pradhana from which the world orig i nates, as de clared by the
Sankhyas.
_Adhikarana VI:_ Sutras 12 to 19 raise the ques tion whether the
‘Anandamaya’ in Taittiriya Upanishad II-5 is merely the in di vid ual soul
or the Su preme Self. The Sutras show that Brah man is All-Bliss and
that by the term ‘Anandamaya’ in Sruti is meant nei ther the in di vid ual
soul, nor the Pradhana of Sankhyas. The Sutras prove that they all
de scribe none but Brah man.
_Adhikarana VII:_ Sutras 20 and 21, show that the golden per son
seen within the sun and the per son seen within the eye men tioned in
Chh. Up. I-6 are not some in di vid ual soul of high em i nence, but the
high est Brah man or the Su preme Self.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ Su tra 22 shows that the ether (Akasa) from
which ac cord ing to Chh. Up. I-9 all be ings orig i nate, is not the el e -
men tal ether but the Su preme Brah man.
_Adhikarana IX:_ Su tra 23 shows that Prana, also men tioned in
Chh. Up. I-11-15 is the Su preme Brah man.
_Adhikarana X:_ Sutras 24 to 27 teach that the light spo ken of in
Chh. Up. III-13-7 is not the or di nary phys i cal light but the Su preme
Brah man.
_Adhikarana XI:_ Sutras 28 to 31 de cide that the Prana men tioned
in Kau. Up. III-2 is Brah man.

Jijnasadhikaranam: Topic 1
The enquiry into Brahman and its pre-requisites.
```
**AWmVmo ~«÷{OkmgmŸ&**

**Athato Brahmajijnasa** I.1.1 (1)

Now, therefore, the enquiry into Brahman.

**Atha:** now, then, afterwards; **Atah:** therefore; **Brahmajijnasa:** a
desire for the knowledge of Brahman (the enquiry into the real nature

of Brahman).
_Su tra_ lit er ally means a string. It serves the pur pose of string ing
to gether the flow ers of the Vedanta pas sages.
The word _Atha_ is not used to in tro duce a new sub ject that is go -
ing to be taken up. It is here to be taken as de not ing im me di ate
consecution.
The en quiry of Brah man spe cially de pends upon some an te -
ced ent con di tions. The en quirer should be en dowed with cer tain spir i -
tual req ui sites or qual i fi ca tions. Then only the en quiry is pos si ble.
_Atha_ i.e., af ter the at tain ment of cer tain pre lim i nary qual i fi ca -
tions such as the four means of sal va tion viz., (1) Nitya-anitya-vastu-
viveka (dis crim i na tion be tween the eter nal and the non-eter nal); (2)
Ihamutrarthaphalabhogaviraga (in dif fer ence to the en joy ment in this
life or in heaven, and of the fruits of one’s ac tions); (3) Shatsampat
(six fold vir tues viz., Sama—con trol of mind, Dama—con trol of the ex -
ter nal senses, Uparati—ces sa tion from worldly en joy ments or not
think ing of ob jects of senses or dis con tinu ance of re li gious cer e mo -
nies, Titiksha—en dur ance of plea sure and pain, heat and cold,
Sraddha—faith in the words of the pre cep tor and of the Upanishads
and Samadhana—deep con cen tra tion); (4) Mumukshutva (de sire for
lib er a tion).
Those who have got an ear nest de sire for the knowl edge of
Brah man only are fit for the study of Vedanta Phi los o phy or Brahma
Sutras. Even with out pos sess ing the knowl edge of Karma Kanda
which deals with re li gious cer e mo nies or sac ri fices, a de sire for at -
tain ing the knowl edge of Brah man will arise di rect from the study of
the Srutis. The en quiry of Brah man does not de pend on the per for -
mance of any acts.

```

```

You must know and real ise the eter nal Brah man. Then only you
will at tain eter nal bliss, free dom, per fec tion and im mor tal ity. You must
have cer tain pre lim i nary qual i fi ca tions for your search. Why should
you en quire about Brah man? Be cause the fruits ob tained by sac ri -
fices etc., are ephem eral, whereas the knowl edge of Brah man is eter -
nal. Life in this earth and the life in heaven which you will at tain on
ac count of your vir tu ous deeds is tran sient. If you know Brah man, you
will en joy ev er last ing bliss and im mor tal ity. That is the rea son why you
must start the quest of Brah man or the Truth or the Ul ti mate Re al ity.
A time co mes when a per son be comes in dif fer ent to Kar mas.
He knows that Kar mas can not give him ev er last ing, un al loyed hap pi -
ness which is not mixed with pain, sor row and fear. There fore, nat u -
rally, a de sire arises in him for the knowl edge of Brah man or the
all-per vad ing, eter nal Soul which is above Kar mas, which is the
source of eter nal hap pi ness.
Charvakas or Lokayatikas think that the body is the soul. Some
think that the senses are the soul. Some oth ers think that the mind is
the soul. Some think that the in tel lect is the soul. Some think that the
soul is a mere mo men tary idea.
Some think that noth ing ex ists in re al ity. Some think that there is
a soul which is dif fer ent from the body which is both agent and enjoyer

of the fruits of ac tion. Oth ers hold that he is not a doer but is only an
enjoyer. Some think that the in di vid ual soul is a part of the Su preme
Soul. Vedantins main tain that the in di vid ual soul is iden ti cal with the

Su preme Soul. Dif fer ent schools of phi los o phy hold dif fer ent views.
There fore it is nec es sary to ex am ine the truth of things very care fully.
Knowl edge of Brah man de stroys Avidya or ig no rance which is
the root of all evil, or the seed of this for mi da ble Samsara or worldly
life. Hence you must en ter tain the de sire of know ing Brah man.
Knowl edge of Brah man leads to the at tain ment of the fi nal eman ci pa -
tion. Hence an en quiry about Brah man through the study of the Srutis
which treats of Brah man is worth while and should be un der taken.
The ques tion now arises: What are the char ac ter is tics of that
Brah man? The na ture of the Brah man is de scribed in the fol low ing
Su tra or aph o rism.

**Janmadyasya yatah** I.1.2 (2)

(Brahman is that) from which the origin etc., (i.e. the origin,
sustenance and dissolution) of this (world proceed).

**Janmadi:** origin etc.; **Asya:** of this (world); **Yatah:** from which.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 13
```

An swer to the en quiry of Brah man is briefly given in this Su tra. It
is stated that Brah man who is eter nally pure, wise and free (Nitya,
Bud dha, Mukta Svabhava) is the only cause, stay and fi nal re sort of
this world. Brah man who is the orig i na tor, pre server and ab sorber of
this vast world must have un lim ited pow ers and char ac ter is tics.
Hence He is Om nip o tent and Om ni scient. Who but the Om nip o tent
and Om ni scient Brah man could cre ate, rule and de stroy it? Cer tainly
mere at oms or chance can not do this work. Ex is tence can not come
out of non-ex is tence ( _Ex nihilo nihil fit_ ). The or i gin of the world can not
pro ceed from a non-in tel li gent Pradhana or Prakriti. It can not pro ceed
from its own na ture or Svabhava spon ta ne ously with out a cause, be -
cause spe cial places, times and causes are needed for the pro duc -
tion of ef fects.

Brah man must have some char ac ter is tics. You can at tain
knowl edge of Brah man through re flec tion on its at trib utes. Oth er wise
it is not pos si ble to have such knowl edge. In fer ence or rea son ing is
an in stru ment of right knowl edge if it does not con tra dict the Vedanta
texts.
In the as cer tain ment of Truth or the Ul ti mate Re al ity or the first
cause the scrip tures alone are au thor i ta tive be cause they are in fal li -
ble, they con tain the di rect in tu itive ex pe ri ences of Rishis or Seers
who at tained Brahma Sakshatkara or Self-reali sa tion. You can not de -
pend on in tel lect or rea son be cause a man of strong in tel lect can
over throw a man of weak in tel lect. Brah man is not an ob ject of the
senses. It is be yond the reach of the senses and the in tel lect.

The sec ond Su tra does not pro pound here that in fer ence serves
as the means of know ing Brah man. It points to a Vedantic text which
gives a de scrip tion of the char ac ter is tics of Brah man. What then, is
that Vedanta text? It is the pas sage of Taittiriya Upanishad III-i: Bhrigu
Varuni went to his fa ther Varuna say ing—“Sir, teach me Brah man.”
Varuna said `Vmo dm B_m{Z ^yVm{Z Om`ÝVoŸ& `oZ OmVm{Z OrdpÝV `Ëà`ÝË`{^g±{depÝVŸ& V{Û{OkmgñdŸ&
VX²>~«÷o{VŸ&&
“That from whence these be ings are born, that by which, when
born they live, that into which they en ter at their death, try to know
That. That is Brah man.”
You will at tain Self-reali sa tion through med i ta tion on Brah man
or the truths de clared by Vedantic texts and not through mere rea son -
ing. Pure rea son (Suddha Buddhi) is a help in Self-reali sa tion. It in -
ves ti gates and re veals the truths of the Scrip tures. It has a place also
in the means of Self-reali sa tion. But per verted in tel lect (Viparita
Buddhi) is a great hin drance. It keeps one far away from the Truth.
That which is the cause of the world is Brah man. This is
Tatastha Lakshana. The or i gin, sus te nance and dis so lu tion of the
world are char ac ter is tics of the world. They do not per tain to the eter -

nal un chang ing Brah man. Yet these in di cate Brah man which is the
cause for this uni verse. Srutis give an other def i ni tion of Brah man.
This is a de scrip tion of its true, es sen tial na ture _“Satyam Jnanam
Anantam Brahma_ —Truth, Knowl edge, In fin ity is Brah man.” This is
Svarupa Lakshana.
The knowl edge of the real na ture of a thing does not de pend on
the no tions of man but only on the thing it self. The knowl edge of Brah -
man also de pends al to gether on the thing, i.e., Brah man it self. Ac tion
de pends en tirely on your will but per cep tion is not an ef fect of vo li tion.
It de pends on the ob ject per ceived. You can not con vert a tree into a
man by an act of will. A tree will re main a tree al ways. Sim i larly Reali -
sa tion of Brah man is Vastu Tan tra. It de pends on the re al ity of the ob -
ject. It is not Purusha Tan tra. It does not de pend on vo li tion. It is not
some thing to be ac com plished by ac tion. Brah man is not an ob ject of
the senses. It has no con nec tion with other means of knowl edge. The
senses are fi nite and de pend ent. They have only ex ter nal things for
their ob jects, not Brah man. They are char ac ter ised by out go ing ten -
den cies on ac count of the force of Rajas. They are in their na ture so
con sti tuted that they run to wards ex ter nal ob jects. They can not cog -
nise Brah man.

Knowl edge of Brah man can not come through mere rea son ing.
You can at tain this knowl edge through in tu ition or rev e la tion. In tu ition
is the fi nal re sult of the en quiry into Brah man. The ob ject of en quiry is
an ex ist ing sub stance. You will have to know this only through in tu -
ition or di rect cog ni tion (Aparakosha-anubhuti or Anubhava—ex pe ri -
ence). Sravana (hear ing of the Srutis), Ma nana (re flec tion on what
you have heard), Nididhyasana (pro found med i ta tion) on Brah man
leads to in tu ition. The Brahmakara Vritti is gen er ated from the Sattvic
Antahkarana which is equipped with the four means of sal va tion, and
the in struc tions of the Guru, who has un der stood the real sig nif i cance
of ‘Tat Tvam Asi’ Mahavakya. This Brahmakara Vritti de stroys the
Mula-Avidya or prim i tive ig no rance, the root cause of all bond age,
births and deaths. When the ig no rance or veil is re moved, Brah man
which is self-ef ful gent re veals It self or shines by It self in Its pris tine
glory and in ef fa ble splen dour. In or di nary per cep tion of ob jects the
mind as sumes the form of the ob ject. The Vritti or ray of the mind re -
moves the veil (Avarana-bhanga) that en vel ops the ob ject and
Vritti-sahita-chaitanya or in tel li gence re flected in the mod i fi ca tion of
the mind re veals the ob ject. Then only you cog nise the ob ject. There
is Vritti-vyapti and there is Phala-vyapti also in the per cep tion of an
ob ject. You want a Vritti and in tel li gence (Chaitanya) as so ci ated with
the Vritti. But in the case of cog ni tion of Brah man there is no
Phala-vyapti. There is only Vritti-vyapti as Brah man is self-lu mi nous.
If there is a cup in a pot, you want a lamp and the eyes to see the cup

in the dark, when the pot is bro ken; but if there is a lamp within the pot,

Sastrayonitvadhikaranam: Topic 3
Brahman is realisable only through the scriptures

The scripture being the source of right knowledge.

**Sastra:** the scripture; **Yonitvat:** being the source of or the means of
the right knowledge.

```
The Om ni science of Brah man fol lows from His be ing the source
```
of scrip ture. The aph o rism clearly points out that the Srutis alone are

proof about Brah man.
As Brah man is the cause of the world we have to in fer that Brah -

man or the Ab so lute is Om ni scient. As the scrip ture alone is the

means of right knowl edge with ref er ence to Brah man the prop o si tion
laid in Su tra 2 be comes con firmed. Brah man is not merely the Cre -

ator, Sustainer and De stroyer of the world, He is the source or womb

of scrip tures and is re vealed by scrip tures. As Brah man is be yond the

reach of the senses and the in tel lect, He can be ap pre hended only on
the au thor ity of the Srutis which are in fal li ble and con tain the spir i tual

ex pe ri ences of real ised seers or sages. The Srutis de clare that Brah -

man Him self breathed forth the Vedas. There fore He who has
brought forth the Srutis or the Vedas which con tain such won der ful di -

vine knowl edge must be all-knowl edge and all-pow er ful.
The scrip tures il lu mine all things like a search light. Scrip ture is

the source or the means of right knowl edge through which you have a

com pre hen sive un der stand ing of the na ture of Brah man. Srutis fur -

nish in for ma tion about what is not known from other sources. It can -
not be known by other means of knowl edge in de pend ently of the

Srutis. Brah man is form less, colour less, attributeless. Hence it can -

not be grasped by the senses by di rect per cep tion. You can in fer the

ex is tence of fire by its ac com pa ny ing smoke but Brah man can not be
es tab lished by in fer ence or anal ogy, be cause it is attributeless and

there can not be a sec ond thing which is sim i lar to Brah man. Brah man

is In fi nite and secondless. He who is ig no rant of the Srutis can not

know that Su preme Be ing. There are other means of knowl edge also
which have got a place but they are not in de pend ent. They sup ple -

ment af ter Brah man is es tab lished by the Srutis.

Samanvayadhikaranam: Topic 4
Brahman the main purport of all Vedantic texts
```
**VÎmw g_Ýd`mV² Ÿ&**

**Tattu Samanvayat** I.1.4 (4)
But that (Brahman is to be known only from the Scriptures
and not independently by any other means is established),
because it is the main purpose (of all Vedantic texts).

**Tat:** that; **Tu:** but; **Samanvayat:** on account of agreement or
harmony, because it is the main purpose.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 2 is con tin ued. Brah man or the
Ab so lute can be known only from the scrip tures be cause all the scrip -
tural pas sages can be har mo nised only by such a doc trine. The
Vedantic texts re fer to Brah man only, be cause they have Brah man for
their main topic. The prop o si tion that Brah man is the only cause of the
world is es tab lished: be cause this is the au thor i ta tive say ing of the
scrip tures. All the Vedantic texts agree in this re spect.
The word ‘tu’ (but) is em ployed to re but the above Purvapaksha
or the prima fa cie view as urged above. It is proper to say that Brah -
man is the uni form topic taught in all the Vedantic texts. Why?
Samanvayat. Anvaya means con stru ing a pas sage ac cord ing to the
six char ac ter is tics or Shad Lingas viz., (1) Upakrama-Upasamhara
Ekavakyata—agree ment in be gin ning and con clu sion; (2)
Abhyasa—rep e ti tion; (3) Apurvata—Unique ness of sub ject mat ter;
(4) Phala—fruit; (5) Arthavada—praise and (6) Yukti—rea son ing.
These six marks help to ar rive at the real pur port of any work. In chap -
ter six of the Chhandogya Upanishad Brah man is the main pur port of
all pas sages. In the be gin ning you will find “This world, my child, was
but the Real (Sat) in the be gin ning.” It con cludes, “In it all that ex ists
has its Self. It is true. It is the Self.” There is agree ment in the open ing
and con clud ing pas sages. This is Upakrama-Upasamhara. Uddalaka
the pre cep tor, re peats ‘Tat Tvam Asi’ nine times to his dis ci ple
Svetaketu. This is rep e ti tion (Abhyasa). Brah man is doubt less
unique, as He is In fi nite and secondless. When you at tain knowl edge
of Brah man ev ery thing else is known. This is Phala or fruit.
There is rea son ing in the scrip tures. Just as pots are noth ing but
clay, or na ments are noth ing but gold, so also this world of names and
forms is noth ing but Brah man. If you know the na ture of clay, you will
know all that is made out of clay. Even so if you know Brah man, ev ery -
thing else will be known to you. Brah man is the source of the cre ation,
pres er va tion and dis so lu tion of the uni verse. This is Artha-vada or
Stuti-vada by way of praise. All these six marks or Shad Lingas de -
note that the chief topic or main pur port of the Vedantic texts is Brah -
man.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 17
```

All the Vedanta-texts have for their pur port Brah man, for ex am -
ple, “Be ing only this was in the be gin ning, one with out a sec ond”
(Chh. Up. VI-2-1) “In the be gin ning all this was At man or Self only”
(Ait. Ara. II-4-I-1) “This is Brah man with out cause and with out ef fect,
with out any thing in side or out side; this self is Brah man per ceiv ing ev -
ery thing” (Bri. Up. II-5-19) “That Im mor tal Brah man is be fore” (Mun.
Up. II-2-11) and sim i lar pas sages. It is not right to think that these pas -
sages have a dif fer ent sense. The pas sages can not re fer to agents,
di vin i ties con nected with acts of re li gious duty. You will find in Bri. Up.
II-4-14, “Then by what should he see and Whom?” This clearly shows
that there is nei ther an agent, nor an ob ject of ac tion, nor an in stru -
ment.
Brah man can not be come an ob ject of per cep tion and other
means of knowl edge, be cause It is ex tremely sub tle, ab stract, in fi nite
and all-per vad ing. How can a fi nite in sen tient in stru ment know the In -
fi nite? The senses and the mind de rive their power and light from
Brah man the source. Brah man is Self-lu mi nous, Self-ex is tent,
Self-knowl edge, Self-de light, and Self-con tained. Brah man can not
be real ised with out the aid of Vedantic pas sage “Tat Tvam Asi—Thou
art That” (Chh. Up. VI-8-7).
When one real ises Brah man, he is to tally freed from all sorts of
mis er ies and pains. He at tains the goal of life or the _sum mum bonum_.
The con cep tion of du al ity as agent, ac tion and the like is de stroyed.
Self-reali sa tion is not a fruit of ac tion. It is not a re sult of your will ing or
do ing. It is the re sult of real is ing one’s iden tity with Brah man. Scrip -
ture aims only at re mov ing the veil of ig no rance or Avidya. Then the
self-ef ful gent Brah man shines by It self in Its pris tine glory. The state
of Moksha or the fi nal eman ci pa tion is eter nal. It is not tran sient like
the fruits at tained through ac tion. Ac tion de pends upon the will and is
in de pend ent of the ob ject. Knowl edge de pends on the na ture of the
ob ject and is in de pend ent of the will of the knower.
A proper un der stand ing of the Vedantic texts leads to the fi nal
eman ci pa tion of man. It is not nec es sary for him to ex ert or do any su -
per hu man feat or ac tion. It is only mere un der stand ing that it is a rope
and not a snake that helps to de stroy one’s fear. Scrip ture does not
speak only of eth i cal and cer e mo nial du ties. It re veals the soul and
helps one to at tain Self-reali sa tion. The sage who has learnt by the
help of Vedantic texts to re move the er ro ne ous iden ti fi ca tion with the
body will not ex pe ri ence pain. It is only the ig no rant worldly minded
man who ex pe ri ences pain on ac count of his iden ti fi ca tion with the
body.
The at tain ment of heaven, pro cur ing a son, get ting rain, etc., are
taught in the Vedas as in cite ment to the ac quire ment of knowl edge of
Brah man by baby souls and to pro duce faith in man. When he finds
that the Ve dic Mantras have the power to pro duce rain he gets faith in

them and has an in cli na tion to study them. He grad u ally gets dis gust
for the mun dane ob jects and de vel ops dis crim i na tion be tween the
real and the tran si tory and burn ing yearn ing for lib er a tion. He de vel -
ops love for Brah man. There fore all Vedas teach Brah man. Sac ri fices
give mun dane fruits only when they are done with self ish mo tives,
only when Kama or strong de sire is at the back of the Mantras. When
they are per formed with Nishkamya Bhava with out self ish mo tives
they pu rify the heart and help to at tain knowl edge of the Self. Hence
Karma Kanda it self, by teach ing the wor ship of var i ous de i ties, be -
comes part of Brahma Jnana. It is re ally the wor ship of Brah man,
when the el e ment of de sire or self ish ness is re moved. Such a wor -
ship pu ri fies the heart and pro duces a taste for en quiry of Brah man. It
does not pro duce any other earthly de sire.
The ob ject of en quiry in the Karma Kanda is some thing to be ac -
com plished viz., duty. The ob ject of en quiry in Vedanta texts is the al -
ready ex is tent, ab so lutely ac com plished Brah man. The fruit of the
knowl edge of Brah man must be dif fer ent from the fruit of knowl edge
of duty which de pends on the per for mance of ac tion.
You will find in the Upanishads “Ver ily the Self (At man) is to be
seen” Bri. Up. II-4-5. “The At man which is free from sin that it is which
we must search out, that it is which we must try to un der stand” Chh.
Up VIII-7-1. “Let a man wor ship him as At man or the Self—Bri. Up
I-4-7; Let a man wor ship the At man only as his true state—Bri. Up.
I-4-15; He who knows Brah man be comes Brah man—Mun. Up.
III-2-9”. These texts rouse in you a de sire to know what that Brah man
is. The Vedantic texts give a beau ti ful de scrip tion of the na ture of
Brah man. They teach that Brah man is eter nal, all-know ing, ab so -
lutely self-suf fi cient, ever pure, free, pure knowl edge, ab so lute bliss,
self-lu mi nous and in di vis i ble. One at tains fi nal eman ci pa tion as the
fruit of med i ta tion on Brah man.
The Vedantic texts de clare, “The wise who knows the At man as
bodi less within the bod ies, as un chang ing among chang ing things, as
great and om ni pres ent does never grieve” (Katha Up. II-22). “He is
with out breath, with out mind, pure” (Mun. Up. II-1-2). “That per son is
not at tached to any thing” (Bri. Up. IV-3-15). All these texts es tab lish
the fact that the fi nal eman ci pa tion dif fers from all the fruits of ac tion

Brah man can not be the ef fect of ac tions. It can not be sup ple men tary
to ac tions. If it is so it would be non-eter nal.
To know Brah man is to be come Brah man. Mundaka Upanishad
says, “He who knows Brah man be comes Brah man.” As Brah man is
an al ready ex ist ing en tity, know ing Brah man does not in volve an act
like a rit u al is tic act. When Avidya or ne science is de stroyed through
knowl edge of the Self, Brah man man i fests It self, just as the rope
man i fests it self when the il lu sion of snake is re moved. As Brah man is
your In ner Self you can not at tain It by any ac tion. It is real ised as
one’s own At man when the ig no rance is an ni hi lated. Texts like “The
At man is to be real ised” etc., is not an in junc tion. It is in tended to with -
draw the mind of the as pi rant from ex ter nal ob jects and turn it in -
wards.
Brah man is not an ob ject of the ac tion of know ing. “It is dif fer ent
from the Known and again it is be yond the Un known (Kena Up. I-3)
“How should he know him by whom He knows all this” (Bri. Up.
II-4-14). Brah man is ex pressly de clared not to be the ob ject of an act
of de vout wor ship (Upasana). “Know that alone to be Brah man, not
that which peo ple adore here” (Kena Up. I-5).
The scrip ture never de scribes Brah man as this or that. Its pur -
pose is to show that Brah man as the eter nal sub ject, Pratyagatman,
the in ner Self is never an ob ject. It can not be main tained that Moksha
or Brah man is some thing to be cer e mo ni ally pu ri fied. There is no
room for a pu rif i ca tory cer e mony in the eter nally pure Brah man.
Brah man is the Self or At man of all. It can nei ther be striven nor
avoided. All ob jects per ish be cause they are mere mod i fi ca tions of
the five el e ments. But the Soul or Brah man is im mor tal and un chang -
ing. It is in its es sence eter nally pure and free.
He who iden ti fies him self with his body ex pe ri ences pain. A
sage who has re moved Dehadhyasa or iden ti fi ca tion of the body by
iden ti fy ing him self with the pure, all-per vad ing Brah man will not ex pe -
ri ence pain. A rich man who is puffed up by the con ceit of his wealth is
af fected with grief when he loses his wealth. But he is not af fected by
the loss of wealth af ter he has once re tired from the world and has be -
come an as cetic. A sage who has at tained knowl edge of Brah man
can not be a merely worldly doer as be fore. He does not be long to this
world as he did be fore. A worldly man also can be come a sage of
Self-reali sa tion with the Bhava of non-doer (Akarta), non-agent
(Abhokta). The Srutis de clare “When he is free from the body, then
nei ther plea sure nor pain touches him” (Chh. Up. VIII-12-1). The ob -
jec tor may say “The state of be ing free from the body fol lows only
when a man dies.” This is en tirely wrong be cause the cause of man
be ing joined to the body is er ro ne ous knowl edge. The sage who has
at tained knowl edge of Brah man, and who iden ti fies him self with
Brah man is free from his body even while still alive. The Sruti also de -

BRAHMA SUTRAS 20
```

clares “Just as the slough of a snake lies on an ant-hill, dead and cast
away, so also lies this body. That bodi less im mor tal Soul is Brah man
only, is only light” (Bri. Up. IV-4-7). With eyes, He is with out eyes as it
were; with ears, with out ears as it were; with speech, with out speech
as it were; with a mind, with out mind as it were; with Prana, with out
Prana as it were; The sage is no lon ger con nected with ac tion of any
kind.
The Sankhyas say that the Vedantic texts about cre ation do not
re fer to Brah man but to the Pradhana which is made up of the three
Gunas—Sattva, Rajas and Tamas—as the First Cause. They main -
tain that all the Vedanta texts which treat of the cre ation of the world
clearly point out that the cause of the world has to be con cluded from
the ef fect by in fer ence and the cause which is to be in ferred is the
con nec tion of the Pradhana or Prakriti with the Souls or Purushas.
The fol low ers of Kanada (the School of Vaiseshika phi los o phy) in fer
from the very same pas sages that the Lord is the ef fi cient cause of the
uni verse and the at oms are its ma te rial cause.
The Sankhyas say “Om nip o tence can be at trib uted to the
Pradhana as it has all its ef fects for its ob jects. Om ni science also can
be as cribed to it. Knowl edge is re ally an at trib ute of Sattva Guna.
Sattva is one of the com po nents of Pradhana. There fore Pradhana
can be said to be om ni scient. You can not as cribe Om ni science or lim -
ited knowl edge to the Soul or Purusha which is iso lated and pure in -
tel li gence it self. There fore the Vedanta texts as cribe Om ni science to
the Pradhana al though it is in it self non-in tel li gent”.
“Brah man is with out any in stru ments of ac tion. As Pradhana
has three com po nents it seems rea son able that it alone is ca pa ble of
un der go ing mod i fi ca tions like clay into var i ous ob jects and may act as
a ma te rial cause, while the un com pounded, ho mo ge neous and un -
change able Brah man is un able to do so. There fore the Vedantic texts
which treat of cre ation clearly re fer to Pradhana only and there fore it

CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 21
```

Sutras 5 to 11 re fute the ar gu ments of the Sankhyas and es tab -
lish Brah man alone as the First Cause.
It is not pos si ble to find room in the Vedanta texts for the non-in -
tel li gent Pradhana, be cause it is not based on scrip ture. Why? Be -
cause see ing or think ing is as cribed to the cause in the scrip ture. In
the scrip ture it is said that the First Cause willed or thought be fore cre -
ation. You will find in the Chhandogya Upanishad VI-2, “Be ing only,
my dear, this was in the be gin ning, one only with out a sec ond. It
thought ‘May I be many, may I grow forth.’ It pro jected fire.” Aitareya
Upanishad says, “The At man willed: ‘Let me pro ject worlds’. So it pro -
jected these worlds” (I-1-1.2). In Prasna Upanishad VI-3 it is said of
the per son of six teen parts. “He thought. He sent forth Prana...” There
can not be any think ing or will ing in the in sen tient Pradhana. It is pos -
si ble only if the First Cause is an in tel li gent be ing like Brah man.
If it is said that such a qual ity can be at trib uted to Prakriti in a
sec ond ary sense, just as red-hot iron can be called fire be cause it can
burn, we re ply, why should we as cribe cre ative power and Om ni -
science to such Prakriti which we in vest with will and Om ni science in
a sec ond ary sense when we can as cribe cre ative power and Om ni -
science to Brah man Him self to whom Will and Om ni science can be
as cribed in a pri mary sense.
Brah man’s knowl edge is per ma nent. He is not in need of any in -
stru ments of knowl edge. He is not in need of a body. His knowl edge is
with out any ob struc tions. Svetasvatara Upanishad says, “He grasps
with out hands, moves with out feet, sees with out eyes, hears with out
ears. He knows what can be known, but no one knows Him. They call
Him the first, the Great per son” (VI-8, III-19).
You can not at trib ute sentiency (Chetanatva) to Pradhana even
in a fig u ra tive sense, be cause it is said that the Cre ator be came the
soul and en tered the body. How can the in sen tient mat ter (Achetana)
be come the sen tient soul (Chetana)? Vedantic texts em phat i cally de -
clare that by know ing Brah man ev ery thing else can be known. How
can we know the souls by know ing mat ter?
Pradhana or mat ter can not be the Sat which is de scribed as the
cause of the world, be cause that would be op posed to the scrip ture
which uses the word “Ikshateh”. You will find in Svetasvatara
Upanishad, “He, the God of all souls, is the Cre ator of the world”.
There fore it is quite clear that Brah man and not Pradhana is the
cause of this world.
In all Vedantic texts there is a uni form dec la ra tion that Chetana
(con scious ness) is the cause of the world. Pradhana po ten tially con -
tains all forms in a seed state. The whole world ex ists in it in a sub tle
seed state in Pralaya and yet it can not be re garded as the Cre ator be -
cause it is non-sen tient. Vedanta texts em phat i cally de clare that an
In tel li gent Be ing willed and cre ated this uni verse. You will find in

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 22
```

Chhandogya Upanishad, “The Sat ex isted in the be gin ning. It was
one with out a sec ond. It willed to be come many. It cre ated fire”.
The ar gu men ta tion of the Sankhyas that the Pradhana is
all-know ing be cause of its Sattva is in ad mis si ble, be cause Sattva is
not pre pon der ant in the Pradhana as the three Gunas are in a state of
equi poise. If the Pradhana is all-know ing even in the con di tion of
equi lib rium (Gunasamyavastha) on ac count of the power of knowl -
edge re sid ing in Sattva, it must be lit tle-know ing also on ac count of
the power of re tard ing knowl edge which re sides in Rajas and Tamas.
There fore while Sattva will make it all-know ing, Rajas and Tamas will
make it lit tle-know ing. This is ac tu ally a con tra dic tion. Fur ther a mod i -
fi ca tion of Sattva which is not con nected with a wit ness ing prin ci ple or
si lent Sakshi is not called knowl edge. The non-in tel li gent Pradhana is
de void of such a prin ci ple. Hence all-know ing ness can not be as -
cribed to Pradhana.
The case of the Yogin does not ap ply to the point un der con sid -
er ation here. He at tains Om ni science on ac count of ex cess of Sattva
in him. There is an in tel li gent prin ci ple (Sakshi) in him in de pend ent of
Sattva. When a Yogi at tains knowl edge of the past and the fu ture on
ac count of the grace of the Lord, you can not deny the Eter nity and In -
fin ity of Brah man’s knowl edge.
Brah man is pure In tel li gence it self, Un change able. All-know ing -
ness and cre ation are not pos si ble for Brah man. To this ob jec tion it
can be re plied that Brah man can be All-know ing and cre ative through
His il lu sory power, Maya.
Just as in the case of ether we talk of ether in side a jar and ether
in the sky but it is all re ally one ether, so also the dif fer en ti a tion of Jiva
and Isvara is only an ap par ent dif fer en ti a tion on ac count of lim it ing
ad juncts or Upadhis, viz., body and mind.
The Sankhyas raise an other ob jec tion. They say that fire and
wa ter also are fig u ra tively spo ken of as in tel li gent be ings. “The fire
thought ‘May I be many, May I grow’ and it pro jected wa ter. Wa ter
thought ‘May I be many, May I grow,’ it pro jected earth” Chh. Up.
6-2-3-4. Here wa ter and fire are in sen tient ob jects, and yet think ing is
at trib uted to them. Even so the think ing by the Sat in the text orig i nally
quoted can also be taken fig u ra tively in the case of Pradhana also.
Hence, though Pradhana is in sen tient, it can yet be the First Cause.
The fol low ing Su tra re futes this ar gu ment.

**Jm¡UüoÞmË_eãXmV² Ÿ&**

**Gaunaschet na Atmasabdat** I.1.6 (6)

If it be said that (the word ‘seeing’ or thinking) is used in a
secondary sense, (we say) not so, because of the word Atman
being applied to the cause of the world.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 23
```

**Gaunah:** indirect, secondary, figurative; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not;

**Atmasabdat:** because of the word Atman, i.e., soul.

You say that the term ‘Sat’ de notes the non-in tel li gent Pradhana
or Prakriti and that ‘think ing’ is at trib uted to it in a sec ond ary or fig u ra -
tive sense only as it is to fire and wa ter. You may ar gue that in ert
things are some times de scribed as liv ing be ings. There fore
Pradhana can well be ac cepted as the ef fi cient cause of the world.
This can not stand. This is cer tainly un ten a ble. Why so? Be cause of
the terms ‘At man’ (soul) be ing ap plied sub se quently in the Sruti to
that which is the cause of the world vide the Sruti “All this uni verse is
in es sence That; That is the Truth. That is At man (Soul). That thou art
O Svetaketu” Chh. Up. VI-8-7. (In struc tion by Uddalaka to his son,
Svetaketu).
The pas sage in Chh. Up. VI-2 be gins, “Be ing (Sat) only, my
dear, this was in the be gin ning”. Af ter cre at ing fire, wa ter, earth, It
thought ‘let me now en ter into these three as this liv ing self (Jiva) and
evolve names and forms’ Chh. Up. VI-3-2. The Sat, the First Cause,
re fers to the in tel li gent prin ci ple, the Jiva as its Self. By the term Jiva
we must un der stand the in tel li gent prin ci ple which rules over the body
and sup ports the Prana. How could such a prin ci ple be the self of the
non-in tel li gent Pradhana? By Self or At man we un der stand a be ing’s
own na ture. There fore it is quite ob vi ous that the in tel li gent Jiva can -
not form the na ture of the non-in tel li gent Pradhana. The think ing on
the part of the fire and wa ter is to be un der stood as de pend ent on
their be ing ruled over by the Sat. Hence it is un nec es sary to as sume a
fig u ra tive sense of the word ‘think ing’.

Now the Sankhya co mes with a new ob jec tion. He says that the
word ‘At man’ (Self) may be ap plied to the Pradhana, al though it is
non-in tel li gent, on ac count of its be ing fig u ra tively used in the sense
of ‘that which serves all pur poses of an other’, as for ex am ple, a king
uses the word ‘self’ to some ser vant who car ries out his wishes
‘Govinda is my (other) self’. Sim i larly it ap plies to Pradhana also be -
cause the Pradhana works for the en joy ment and the fi nal sal va tion of
the soul and serves the soul just in the same man ner as the min is ter
serves his king. Or else the word At man (Self) may re fer to non-in tel li -
gent things, as well as to in tel li gent be ings, as for in stance, in ex pres -
sions like Bhutatma (the Self of the el e ments), Indriyatma (the Self of
the senses) just as the one word ‘light’ (Jyoti) de notes a cer tain sac ri -
fice (the Jyotistoma) as well as a flame. There fore the word Self (At -
man) can be used with ref er ence to the Pradhana also. How then
does it fol low from the word ‘Self’ that the ‘think ing’ at trib uted to the
cause of the uni verse is not to be taken in a fig u ra tive sense?

statement of salvation.

```
Fur ther rea son is given in this Su tra to prove that Pradhana is
```
not the cause of this world.
The non-in tel li gent Pradhana can not be de noted by the term
‘Self’ be cause Chhandogya Upanishad de clares: “O Svetaketu! That
(the sub tle Sat) is the Self. ‘Thou art That’.” An in tel li gent man like
Svetaketu can not be iden ti fied with the non-in tel li gent Pradhana. If
the non-in tel li gent Pradhana were de noted by the term ‘Sat’, the
mean ing of the Mahavakya “Tat Tvam Asi” would be ‘Thou art non-in -
tel li gent’. The teach ing will come to this. You are an Achetana or
non-in tel li gence and eman ci pa tion is at tain ing such a state of
insentiency. Then the Srutis would be a source of evil. The scrip tures
would make con tra dic tory state ments to the dis ad van tage of man and
would thus not be come a means of right knowl edge. It is not right to
de stroy the au thor ity of the fault less Srutis. If you as sume that the in -
fal li ble Sruti is not the means of right knowl edge this will be cer tainly
quite un rea son able.
The fi nal eman ci pa tion is de clared in the Srutis to him who is de -
voted to the Sat, who has his be ing in Sat. It can not be at tained by
med i ta tion on the non-in tel li gent Pradhana vide Sruti: ‘He waits only
till he is re leased and there from unites with Brah man’ (Chh. Up.
VI-14-2).
If the scrip ture which is re garded as a means of right knowl edge
should point out a man who is de sir ous of eman ci pa tion but who is ig -
no rant of the way to it, an in sen tient self as the true Self he would, like
the blind man who had caught hold of the ox’s tail to reach his vil lage,
never be able to at tain the fi nal re lease or the true Self.
There fore the word ‘Self’ is ap plied to the sub tle Sat not in a
merely fig u ra tive sense. It re fers to what is in tel li gent only in its pri -
mary mean ing. The ‘Sat’, the first cause, does not re fer to the
Pradhana but to an in tel li gent prin ci ple. It is de clared in the Sruti that
he, who is ab so lutely de voted to the Cre ator or cause of the world, at -
tains the fi nal eman ci pa tion. It is not rea son able to say that one at -
tains his re lease by de vo tion to blind mat ter, Pradhana. Hence
Pradhana can not be the Cre ator of the world.

**Heyatvavachanaccha** I.1.8 (8)

And (the Pradhana cannot be denoted by the word ‘Self’),
because it is not stated (by the scriptures) that It (Sat) has to be
discarded.

**Heyatva:** fitness to be discarded; **Avachanat:** not being stated (by
the scriptures); **Cha:** and.

An other rea son is given in this Su tra to prove that Pradhana is
not the Cre ator of the uni verse.
If you want to point out to a man the small star Arundhati, you di -
rect his at ten tion at first to a big neigh bour ing star and say ‘That is
Arundhati’ al though it is re ally not so. Then you point out to him the
real Arundhati. Even so if the pre cep tor in tended to make his dis ci ple
un der stand the Self step by step from grosser to sub tler truths
through the non-self he would def i nitely state in the end that the Self is
not of the na ture of the Pradhana and that the Pradhana must be dis -
carded. But no such state ment is made. The whole chap ter of the
Chhandogya Upanishad deals with the Self as noth ing but that Sat.
An as pi rant has been taught to fix his mind on the cause and
med i tate on it. Cer tainly he can not at tain the fi nal eman ci pa tion by
med i tat ing on the in ert Pradhana. If the Sruti here meant the
Pradhana to be the cause of the world, it would have surely asked the
as pi rant to aban don such a cause and find out some thing higher for
his fi nal eman ci pa tion. Hence Pradhana can not be the end and aim of
spir i tual quest.

The word ‘and’ sig ni fies that the con tra dic tion of a pre vi ous
state ment is an ad di tional rea son for the re jec tion.

Fur ther this chap ter be gins with the ques tion, “What is that
which be ing known ev ery thing is known? Have you ever asked, my
child, for that in struc tion by which you hear what can not be heard, by
which you per ceive what can not be per ceived, by which you know
what can not be known.” Now if the term ‘Sat’ de noted the Pradhana, if
the Pradhana were the first cause, then by know ing Pradhana ev ery -
thing must be known, which is not a fact. The enjoyer (soul) which is
dif fer ent from Pradhana, which is not an ef fect of the Pradhana can -
not be known by know ing the Pradhana. If ‘that’ or Sat means
Pradhana (mat ter) the Srutis should teach us to turn away from it. But
it is not the case. It gives a def i nite as sur ance that by know ing that ev -
ery thing can be known. How can we know the soul by know ing mat -
ter? How can we know the enjoyer by know ing the en joyed? Hence
the Pradhana is not de noted by the term ‘Sat’. It is not the first cause,
know ing which ev ery thing is known, ac cord ing to the Sruti.
For this the Sutrakara gives an other rea son.

**Svapyayat** I.1.9 (9)

On account of (the individual) merging in its own Self (the Self

cannot be the Pradhana).

**Svapyayat:** on account of merging in one’s own self.

The ar gu ment to prove that Pradhana is not the cause of the
uni verse or the Self is con tin ued.

The wak ing state is that where the mind, the senses and the
body act in con cert to know the ob jects. The in di vid ual soul iden ti fies
him self with the gross body. In the dream ing state the body and the
senses are at rest and the mind plays with the im pres sions which the
ex ter nal ob jects have left. The mind weaves its web of Vasanas. In
deep sleep the in di vid ual soul is free from the lim i ta tion of mind. He
rests in his own Self though in a state of ig no rance.

With ref er ence to the cause de noted by the word ‘Sat’ the Sruti
says, “When a man sleeps here, then my child, he be comes united
with the Sat, he is gone to his own self. There fore they say of him ‘he
sleeps’ (Svapiti) be cause he is gone to his own (Svam Apita) Chh. Up.
VI-8-1. From the fact that the in di vid ual soul merges in the uni ver sal
soul in deep sleep, it is un der stood that the Self, which is de scribed in
the Sruti as the ul ti mate Re al ity, the cause of the world is not
Pradhana.
In the Chhandogya text it is clearly said that the in di vid ual soul
merges or re solves in the Sat. The in tel li gent Self can clearly not re -
solve it self into the non-in tel li gent Pradhana. Hence, the Pradhana
can not be the First Cause de noted by the term ‘Sat’ in the text. That
into which all in tel li gent souls are merged in an in tel li gent cause of the
uni verse is de noted by the term Sat and not the Pradhana.
A fur ther rea son for the Pradhana not be ing the cause is given in
the next Su tra.

All the Vedanta texts uni formly teach that the cause of the world is the

sparks pro ceed in all di rec tions, thus from that Self the Pranas pro -
ceed each to wards its place, from the Pranas the gods, from the gods
the worlds” (Kau. Up. III-3). “From that Brah man sprang ether” (Tait.
Up. II-1). “All this springs from the Self” (Chh. Up. VII-2-6). “This
Prana is born from the Self” (Pra. Up. III-3). All these pas sages de -
clare the Self to be the cause. The term ‘Self’ de notes an in tel li gent
be ing. There fore the all-know ing Brah man is to be taken as the cause
of the world be cause of the uni for mity of view of the Vedanta texts.
A fur ther rea son for this con clu sion is given in the fol low ing
Sutra.

**lwVËdmƒŸ&**

**Srutatvaccha** I.1.11 (11)

And because it is directly stated in the Sruti (therefore the
all-knowing Brahman alone is the cause of the universe).

**Srutatvat:** being declared by the Sruti; **Cha:** also, and.

The ar gu ment that Pradhana is not the cause of the world is
con tin ued.
The All-know ing Lord is the cause of the uni verse. This is stated
in a pas sage of the Svetasvatara Upanishad VI-9, “He is the cause,
the Lord of the lords of the or gans. He has nei ther par ent nor lord”.
‘He’ re fers to the all-know ing Lord de scribed in the chap ter. There fore
it is fi nally es tab lished that the All-know ing, All-pow er ful Brah man is
the First Cause and not the in sen tient or non-in tel li gent Pradhana or
any body else.
Thus the Vedanta texts con tained in Su tra I-1-11 have clearly
shown that the Om ni scient, Om nip o tent Lord is the cause of the or i -
gin, sub sis tence and dis so lu tion of the world. It is al ready shown on
ac count of the uni for mity of view (I-1-10) that all Vedanta texts hold an
in tel li gent cause.
From Su tra 12 on wards till the end of the first chap ter a new
topic is taken up for dis cus sion. The Upanishads speak of two types
of Brah man, viz., the Nirguna or Brah man with out at trib utes and the
Saguna or Brah man with at trib utes.
The Upanishads de clare, “For where there is du al ity as it were,
then one sees the other; but when the Self only is all this, how should
he see an other?” Bri. Up. IV-5-15. “Where one sees noth ing else,
hears noth ing else, un der stands noth ing else, that is the great est (In -
fi nite, Bhuma). Where one sees some thing else, hears some thing

“Who is with out parts, with out ac tions, tran quil, with out faults,

All these texts de clare Brah man to pos sess a dou ble na ture, ac -
cord ing as it is the ob ject ei ther of ne science or knowl edge. Brah man
with at trib utes (Saguna) is within the do main of ne science. It is the ob -
ject of Upasana which is of dif fer ent kinds giv ing dif fer ent re sults,
some to ex al ta tions, some to grad ual eman ci pa tion (Krama-Mukti),
some to suc cess in works. When it is the ob ject of ne science, cat e go -

of Upasana are dis tinct ow ing to the dis tinc tion of the dif fer ent qual i -

as the wor ship re fers to dif fer ent qual i ties. The Srutis say “Ac cord ing
as man wor ships him, that he be comes.” “Ac cord ing to what his

Up. III-14-1. Med i ta tion on the Saguna Brah man can not lead to im me -

Nirguna Brah man of Vedantins or Jnanis is free from all at trib -
utes and lim it ing ad juncts. It is Nirupadhika, i.e., free from Upadhi or
Maya. It is the ob ject of knowl edge. The Knowl edge of the Nirguna
Brah man alone leads to im me di ate eman ci pa tion.
The Vedantic pas sages have a doubt ful im port. You will have to
find out the true sig nif i cance of the texts through rea son ing. You will
have to make a proper en quiry into the mean ing of the texts in or der to

which leads to in stan ta neous eman ci pa tion. A doubt may arise
whether the knowl edge has the higher or the lower Brah man for its
ob ject as in the case of Su tra I-1-2.
You will find in many places in the Upanishads that Brah man is
de scribed ap par ently with qual i fy ing ad juncts. The Srutis say that the
knowl edge of that Brah man leads to in stan ta neous re lease
(Sadyo-Mukti). Wor ship of Brah man as lim ited by those ad juncts can -
not lead to im me di ate eman ci pa tion. But if these qual i fy ing ad juncts
are con sid ered as not be ing ul ti mately ar rived at by the pas sages but
used merely as in dic a tive of Brah man then these pas sages would re -
fer to the Nirguna Brah man and the fi nal eman ci pa tion would re sult
from know ing that Brah man. There fore you will have to find out the
true sig nif i cance of the pas sages through care ful en quiry and rea son -
ing.
In some places you will have to find out whether the text re fers to
Saguna Brah man or the in di vid ual soul. You will have to ar rive at a

Anandamayadhikaranam: Topic 6 (Sutras 12-19)
Anandamaya is Para Brahman.
```
**AmZÝX_`mo@ä`mgmV² &**

**Anandamayo’bhyasat** I.1.12 (12)

Anandamaya means Para Brahman on account of the
repetition (of the word ‘bliss’ as denoting the Highest Self).

**Anandamayah:** full of bliss; **Abhyasat:** because of repetition.

Now the au thor Badarayana takes up the topic of Samanvaya.
He clearly shows that sev eral words of the Srutis which are ap par -
ently am big u ous re ally ap ply to Brah man. He be gins with the word
‘Anandamaya’ and takes up other words one af ter an other till the end
of the chap ter.
Taittiriya Upanishad says, “Dif fer ent from this Vijnanamaya is
an other in ner Self which con sists of bliss (Anandamaya). The for mer
is filled by this. Joy (Priya) is its head. Sat is fac tion (Moda) is its right
wing or arm. Great sat is fac tion (Pramoda) is its left wing or arm. Bliss
(Ananda) is its trunk. Brah man is the tail, the sup port.” II-5
Now a doubt arises as to whether this Anandamaya is Jiva (hu -
man soul) or Para Brah man. The Purvapakshin or op po nent holds
that the Self con sist ing of bliss (Anandamaya) is a sec ond ary self and
not the prin ci pal Self, which is some thing dif fer ent from Brah man, as it
forms a link in a se ries of selfs be gin ning with the self con sist ing of
food (Annamaya), all of which are not the prin ci pal Self. Even though
the bliss ful Self, Anandamaya Purusha, is stated to be the in ner most
of all it can not be the pri mary Self, be cause it is stated to have joy,
etc., for its lim its and to be em bod ied. “It also has the shape of man.
Like the hu man shape of the for mer is the hu man shape of the lat ter”.
If it were iden ti cal with the pri mary Self, joy, sat is fac tion, etc., would
not af fect it; but the text clearly says, ‘Joy is its head’. The text also
says, ‘Of that for mer one this one is the em bod ied Self’ Tait. Up. II-6.
Of that for mer Self of bliss (Anandamaya) is the em bod ied Self. That
which has a body will be cer tainly af fected by joy and pain. The term
Anandamaya sig ni fies a mod i fi ca tion. There fore it can not re fer to
Brah man which is change less. Fur ther five dif fer ent parts such as
head, right arm, left arm, trunk and tail are men tioned of this
Anandamaya Self. But Brah man is with out parts. There fore the
Anandamaya Self is only Jiva or the in di vid ual soul.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 30
```

Here is the an swer of the Siddhantin. This Su tra shows that
Brah man is Bliss. By the Anandamaya Self we have to un der stand
the High est Self, ‘on ac count of rep e ti tion’. Abhyasa or rep e ti tion
means ut ter ing a word again with out any qual i fi ca tions. It is one of the
Shad Lingas or six char ac ter is tics or marks by which the sub ject mat -
ter of a pas sage is as cer tained.
The word ‘Bliss’ is re peat edly ap plied to the high est Self.
Taittiriya Upanishad says: _‘Raso vai sah. Rasam hyevayam
labdhvanandi bhavati’_ —‘He the High est Self is Bliss in it self. The in di -
vid ual soul be comes bliss ful af ter at tain ing that Bliss’ II-7. ‘Who could
breathe forth if that Bliss did not ex ist in the ether of the heart? Be -
cause He alone causes Bliss. He at tains that Self con sist ing of Bliss’
II-7. “He who knows the Bliss of Brah man fears noth ing” II-9. And
again “He (Bhrigu, hav ing taken re course to med i ta tion), real ised or
un der stood that Bliss is Brah man— _Anandam Brahmeti vyajanat_ ”
III-6.
Varuna teaches his son Bhrigu what is Brah man. He first de -
fines Brah man as the cause of the cre ation, etc., of the uni verse and
then teaches him that all ma te rial ob jects are Brah man. Such as, food
is Brah man, Prana is Brah man, mind is Brah man, etc. He says this in
or der to teach that they are the ma te ri als of which the world is made.
Fi nally he con cludes his teach ing with ‘Ananda’ de clar ing that
‘Ananda is Brah man’. Here he stops and con cludes that ‘the doc trine
taught by me is based on Brah man, the Su preme’ Taitt. Up. III-6-1.
“Knowl edge and Bliss is Brah man” Bri. Up. III-9-27. As the word
‘Bliss’ is re peat edly used with ref er ence to Brah man, we con clude
that the Self con sist ing of bliss is Brah man also.
It is ob jected that the bliss ful Self de notes the in di vid ual soul as
it forms a link in a se ries of sec ond ary selfs be gin ning with the
Annamaya Self. This can not stand be cause the Anandamaya Self is
the in ner most of all. The Sruti teaches step by step, from the grosser
to the sub tler, and more and more in te rior and finer for the sake of
easy com pre hen sion by men of small in tel lect. The first re fers to the
phys i cal body as the Self, be cause worldly minded peo ple take this
body as the Self. It then pro ceeds from the body to an other self, the
Pranamaya self, then again to an other one. It rep re sents the non-self
as the Self for the pur pose of easy un der stand ing. It fi nally teaches
that the in ner most Self which con sists of bliss is the real Self, just as a
man points out at first to an other man sev eral stars which are not
Arundhati as be ing Arundhati and fi nally points out in the end the real
Arundhati. There fore here also the Anandamaya Self is the real Self
as it is the in ner most or the last.
‘Tail’ does not mean the limb. It means that Brah man is the sup -
port of the in di vid ual soul as He is the sub stra tum of the Jiva.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 31
```

The pos ses sion of a body hav ing parts and joy and so on as
head, etc., are also at trib uted to It, on ac count of the pre ced ing lim it -
ing con di tion viz., the self con sist ing of un der stand ing, the so-called
Vijnanamaya Kosha. They do not re ally be long to the real Self. The
pos ses sion of a body is as cribed to the Self of Bliss, only be cause it is
rep re sented as a link in the chain of bod ies which be gins with the self
con sist ing of food. It is not at trib uted to it in the same sense in which it
is pred i cated of the in di vid ual soul or the sec ond ary self (the
Samsarin). There fore the Self con sist ing of Bliss is the high est Brah -
man.
Thus, the Su tra es tab lishes that Anandamaya is Brah man. But
the com men ta tor Sankara has a new ori en ta tion of out look in this re -
gard. The Acharya says that Anandamaya can not be Brah man be -
cause Anandamaya is one of the five sheaths or Koshas of the
in di vid ual, the other four be ing Annamaya (phys i cal body),
Pranamaya (vi tal body), Manomaya (men tal body), and Vijnanamaya
(in tel lec tual body). The Anandamaya is ac tu ally the causal body
which de ter mines the func tions of the other sheaths. The in di vid ual
en ters into the Anandamaya sheath in deep sleep and en joys bliss
there, which is the rea son why this sheath is called Anandamaya
(bliss-filled). A cov er age of in di vid u al ity can not be re garded as Brah -
man. Fur ther, if Anandamaya had been Brah man it self, the in di vid ual
in deep sleep will be united with Brah man in that con di tion. But this
does not hap pen since one who goes to sleep re turns to or di nary
wak ing ex pe ri ence. Hence the Anandamaya is not Brah man.

**{dH$maeãXmÞo{V MoV² Z àmMw`m©V² &**

**Vikarasabdanneti chet na prachuryat** I.1.13 (13)

If (it be objected that the term Anandamaya consisting of bliss
can) not (denote the Supreme Self) because of its being a word
denoting a modification or transformation or product (we say
that the objection is) not (valid) on account of abundance,
(which is denoted by the suffix ‘maya’).

**Vikara sabdat:** from the word ‘Anandamaya’ with the suffix ‘mayat’
denoting modification; **Na:** is not; **Iti:** this; thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not so;
**Prachuryat:** because of abundance.

An ob jec tion against Su tra 12 is re futed in this Su tra.
If the ob jec tor says that ‘maya’ means mod i fi ca tion, it can not be.
We can not pred i cate such a mod i fi ca tion with re gard to Brah man who
is change less. We re ply that ‘maya’ means fulness or abun dance and
Anandamaya means not a de riv a tive from Ananda or Bliss but
fulness or abun dance of bliss.
The word ‘Anandamaya’ has been cer tainly ap plied to de note
the Su preme Soul or the High est Self and not the in di vid ual soul. In

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 32
```

the Tait. Up. II-8 the Bliss of Brah man is fi nally de clared to be ab so -
lutely Su preme. “Maya” there fore de notes abun dance or “fulness”.
Anandamaya does not mean ab sence of pain or sor row. It is a
pos i tive at trib ute of Brah man and not a mere ne ga tion of pain.
Anandamaya means ‘He whose es sen tial na ture or Svarupa is
Ananda or Bliss’. When we say: ‘the sun has abun dance of light’, it re -
ally means, the sun, whose es sen tial na ture is light is called
Jyotirmaya. There fore Anandamaya is not Jiva but Brah man.
‘Anandamaya’, is equal to ‘Ananda-svarupa’—He whose es sen tial
na ture is bliss. ‘Maya’ has not the force of Vikara or mod i fi ca tion here.
The word ‘Ananda’ or Bliss is used re peat edly in the Srutis only
with ref er ence to Brah man. ‘Maya’ does not mean that Brah man is a
mod i fi ca tion or ef fect of Bliss. ‘Maya’ means per va sion.
The phrase ‘The sac ri fice is Annamaya’ means ‘the sac ri fice is
abound ing in food’, not ‘is some mod i fi ca tion or prod uct of food’!
There fore here also Brah man, as abound ing in Bliss, is called
Anandamaya.

**VÕoVwì`nXoemƒŸ&**

**Taddhetuvyapadesaccha** I.1.14. (14)

And because he is declared to be the cause of it (i.e. of bliss;
therefore ‘maya’ denotes abundance or fulness).

**Tad + Hetu:** the cause of that, namely the cause of Ananda;
**Vyapadesat:** because of the statement of declaration; **Cha:** and.

An other ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 12 is given.
The Srutis de clare that “it is Brah man who is the cause of bliss
of all.” “ _Esha hyevanandayati_ —For he alone causes bliss” Tait. Up.
II-7. He who causes bliss must him self abound in bliss, just as a man
who en riches oth ers must him self be in pos ses sion of abun dant
wealth. The giver of bliss to all is Bliss it self. As ‘Maya’ may be un der -
stood to de note abun dance, the Self con sist ing of bliss,
Anandamaya, is the Su preme Self or Brah man.
The Sruti de clares that Brah man is the source of bliss to the in -
di vid ual soul. The do nor and the donee can not be one and the same.
There fore it is un der stood that ‘Anandamaya’ as stated in Su tra 12 is
Brah man.

**_mÝÌd{U©H$_od M Jr`VoŸ&**

**Mantravarnikameva cha giyate** I.1.15 (15)

Moreover that very Brahman which has been re-referred to in
the Mantra portion is sung (i.e. proclaimed in the Brahmana
passage as the Anandamaya).

**Mantra-varnikam:** He who is described in the Mantra portion; **Eva:**
the very same; **Cha:** and also, moreover; **Giyate:** is sung.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 33
```

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 12 is con tin ued. The pre vi ous
proofs were founded on Lingas. The ar gu ment which is now given is
based on Prakarana.
The Self con sist ing of bliss is the high est Brah man for the fol -
low ing rea son also. The sec ond chap ter of the Taittiriya Upanishad
be gins, “He who knows Brah man at tains the High -
est— _Brahmavidapnoti Param_. Brah man is Truth, Knowl edge and In -
fin ity ( _Satyam, Jnanam, Anantam Brahma_ )” (Tait. Up. II-1). Then it is
said that from Brah man sprang at first the ether and then all other
mov ing and non-mov ing things. The Brah man en ter ing into the be -
ings stays in the re cess, in most of all. Then the se ries of the dif fer ent
self are enu mer ated. Then for easy un der stand ing it is said that dif fer -
ent from this is the in ner Self. Fi nally the same Brah man which the
Man tra had pro claimed is again pro claimed in the pas sage un der dis -
cus sion, “dif fer ent from this is the other in ner Self, which con sists of
bliss”. The Brahmanas only ex plain what the Mantras de clare. There
can not be a con tra dic tion be tween the Man tra and Brahmana por -
tions.
A fur ther in ner Self dif fer ent from the Self con sist ing of bliss is
not men tioned. On the same i.e. the Self con sist ing of bliss is
founded. “This same knowl edge of Bhrigu and Varuna, he un der stood
that bliss is Brah man” Tait. Up. III-6. There fore the Self con sist ing of
Bliss is the Su preme Self.
“ _Brahmavidapnoti Param_ ”—The knower of Brah man ob tains
the High est. This shows that the wor ship per Jiva ob tains the wor -
shipped Brah man. There fore Brah man who is the ob ject at tained
must be con sid ered as dif fer ent from the Jiva who ob tains, be cause
the ob tained and the obtainer can not be one and the same. Hence
the Anandamaya is not Jiva. The Brah man which is de scribed in the
Mantras ( _Satyam Jnanam Anantam Brahma_ ) is de scribed later on in
the Brahmanas as Anandamaya. It is our duty to real ise the iden tity of
the teach ing in the Mantras and the Brahmanas which form the
Vedas.

**ZoVamo@ZwnnÎmo...Ÿ&**

**Netaro’nupapatteh** I.1.16 (16)
(Brahman and) not the other (i.e. the individual soul is meant
here) on account of the impossibility (of the latter assumption).

**Na:** not; **Itarah:** the other, i.e., the Jiva; **Anupapatteh:** because of the
impossibility, non-reasonableness.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 12 is con tin ued.
The Jiva is not the be ing re ferred to in the Man tra “ _Satyam
Jnanam Anantam Brahma_ ” be cause of the im pos si bil ity of such a
con struc tion.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 34
```

The in di vid ual soul can not be de noted by the term “the one con -
sist ing of bliss.” Why? On ac count of the im pos si bil ity. Be cause the
scrip ture says with ref er ence to the Self con sist ing of bliss, “He
wished ‘May I be many, may I grow forth.’ He re flected. Af ter he had
thus re flected, he sent forth what ever there is”.
He who is re ferred to in the pas sage, “The Self con sist ing of
bliss etc.” is said to be cre ator of ev ery thing. “He pro jected all this
what ever is” Tait. Up. II-6. The Jiva or the in di vid ual soul can not cer -
tainly do this. There fore he is not re ferred to in the pas sage “The Self
con sist ing of bliss” etc.

**^oXì`nXoemƒŸ&**

**Bhedavyapadesaccha** I.1.17 (17)

And on account of the declaration of the difference (between
the two i.e. the one referred to in the passage ‘The Self
consisting of bliss’ etc. and the individual soul, the latter
cannot be the one referred to in the passage).

**Bheda:** difference; **Vyapadesat:** because of the declaration; **Cha:**
and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 12 is con tin ued.
The Sruti makes a dis tinc tion be tween the two. It de scribes that
one is the giver of bliss and the other as the re ceiver of bliss. The Jiva
or the in di vid ual soul, who is the re ceiver, can not be the
Anandamaya, who is the giver of bliss.
“The Self con sist ing of bliss is of the es sence of fla vour at tain ing
which the in di vid ual soul is bliss ful: _Raso vai sah_ (Brahma) _Rasam
hyeva’yam_ (Jiva) l _abdhva’nandi bhavati_ .” Tait. Up. II-7.
That which is at tained and the attainer can not be the same.
Hence the in di vid ual soul is not re ferred to in the pas sage which
is un der dis cus sion.

**H$m_mƒ ZmZw_mZmnojmŸ&**

**Kamaccha Nanumanapeksha** I.1.18 (18)

Because of wishing or willing in the scriptural passage we
cannot say even inferentially that Anandamaya means
Pradhana.

**Kamat:** because of desire or willing; **Cha:** and; **Na:** not; **Anumana:**
the inferred one, i. e., the Pradhana; **Apeksha:** necessity.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 12 is con tin ued.
The word ‘Akamyata’ (willed) in the scrip tural text shows that the
Anandamaya can not be Pradhana (pri mor dial mat ter), be cause will
can not be as cribed to non-sen tient (Jada) mat ter. Prakriti is non-sen -
tient and can have no Kamana or wish. There fore the Anandamaya
with re gard to which the word Kama is used can not be Prakriti or

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 35
```

Pradhana. That which is in ferred i.e. the non-in tel li gent Pradhana as -
sumed by the Sankhyas can not be re garded as be ing the Self of bliss
(Anandamaya) and the cause of the world.

**Apñ_Þñ` M VÚmoJ§ empñVŸ&**

**Asminnasya cha tadyogam sasti** I.1.19 (19)

And moreover it, i e., the scripture, teaches the joining of this,
i.e., the individual soul, with that, i.e., consisting of bliss
(Anandamaya) when knowledge is attained.

**Asmin:** in him; in the person called Anandamaya; **Asya:** his, of the
Jiva; **Cha:** and, also; **Tat:** that; **Yogam:** union; **Sasti:** (Sruti) teaches.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 12 is con cluded in this Su tra.
Scrip ture teaches that the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul ob tains the
fi nal eman ci pa tion when he at tains knowl edge, when he is joined or
iden ti fied with the Self of bliss un der dis cus sion. The Sruti de clares,
“When he finds free dom from fear, and rest in that which is in vis i ble,
bodi less, in de fin able and supportless, then he has at tained the fear -
less (Brah man). If he has the small est dis tinc tion in it there is fear (of
Samsara) for him” Tait. Up. 1 1-7.
Per fect rest is pos si ble only when we un der stand by the Self
con sist ing of bliss, the Su preme Self and not ei ther the Pradhana or
the in di vid ual soul. There fore it is proved that the Self con sist ing of
bliss (Anandamaya) is the Su preme Self or Para Brah man.

```
Antaradhikaranam: Topic 7 (Sutras 20-21)
The being or person in the Sun and the eye is Brahman.
```
**AÝVñVÕ_m}nXoemV² &**

**Antastaddharmopadesat** I.1.20 (20)
The being within (the Sun and the eye) is Brahman, because
His attributes are taught therein.

**Antah:** (Antaratma, the being within the sun and the eye); **Tat
Dharma:** His essential attribute; **Upadesat:** because of the teaching,
as Sruti teaches.

The won der ful Purusha of Chhandogya Upanishad de scribed in
chap ters 1, 6 and 7 is Brah man.
From the de scrip tion in the Chhandogya Upanishad of the es -
sen tial qual i ties be long ing to the In dwell ing Spirit re sid ing in the Sun
and in the hu man eye, it is to be un der stood that he is Brah man and
not the in di vid ual soul. You will find in Chhandogya Upanishad I-6-6,
“Now that per son bright as gold who is seen within the sun, with beard
bright as gold and hair bright as gold al to gether to the very tips of his
nails, whose eyes are like blue lo tus. His name is ‘Ut’ be cause he has
risen (Udita) above all evil. He tran scends all lim i ta tions. He also who
knows this rises above all evil. So much with ref er ence to the Devas.”

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 36
```

With ref er ence to the body, “Now the per son who is seen in the
eye is Rik. He is Sama. He is Uktha. He is Yajus. He is Brah man. His
form is the same as that of the for mer i.e. of the Be ing in the Sun. The
joints of the one are the joints of the other, the name of the one is the
name of the other” Chh. Up. I-7-5.
Do these texts re fer to some spe cial in di vid ual soul who by
means of knowl edge and pi ous deeds has raised him self to an ex -
alted state; or do they re fer to the eter nally per fect su preme Brah -
man? The Purvapakshin says that the ref er ence is to an in di vid ual
soul only, as the scrip ture speaks of a def i nite shape, par tic u lar
abode. Spe cial fea tures are at trib uted to the per son in the Sun, such
as the pos ses sion of beard as bright as gold and so on. The same
char ac ter is tics be long to the be ing in the eye also.
On the con trary no shape can be at trib uted to the Su preme
Lord, “That which is with out sound, with out touch, with out form, with -
out de cay” Kau. Up. I-3-15.
Fur ther a def i nite abode is stated, “He who is in the Sun. He who
is in the eye”. This shows that an in di vid ual soul is meant. As re gards
the Su preme Lord, he has no spe cial abode, “Where does he rest? In
his own glory” Chh. Up. VII-24-1. “Like the ether he is Om ni pres ent,
Eter nal”.
The power of the be ing in ques tion is said to be lim ited. “He is
the Lord of the worlds be yond that and of the wishes of the Devas,”
shows that the power of the be ing in the Sun is lim ited. “He is the Lord
of the worlds be neath that and of the wishes of men,” shows that the
power of the per son in the eye is lim ited. Whereas the power of the
Su preme Lord is un lim ited. “He is the Lord of all, the King of all things,
the Pro tec tor of all things.” This in di cates that the Lord is free from all
lim i ta tions. There fore the be ing in the Sun and in the eye can not be
the Su preme Lord.
This Su tra re futes the above ob jec tion of the Purvapakshin. The
be ing within the Sun and within the eye is not the in di vid ual soul, but
the Su preme Lord only. Why? Be cause His es sen tial at trib utes are
de clared.
At first the name of the be ing within the Sun is stated, “His name
is ‘Ut’.” Then it is de clared, “He has risen above all evil”. The same
name is then trans ferred to the be ing in the eye, “the name of the one
is the name of the other”. Per fect free dom from sins is as cribed to the
Su preme Self only, the Self which is free from sin etc., _Apahatapapma_
Chh. Up. VIII-7. There is the pas sage, “He is Rik. He is Saman, Uktha,
Yajus, Brah man,” which de clares the be ing in the eye to be the Self,
Saman and so on. This is pos si ble only if the be ing is the Lord, who as
be ing the cause of all, is to be re garded as the Self of all.
Fur ther it is de clared, “Rik and Saman are his joints” with ref er -
ence to the Devas, and “the joints of the one are the joints of the other

with ref er ence to the body”. This state ment can be made only with ref -

The men tion of a par tic u lar abode, viz., the Sun and the eye, of

form with a beard bright as gold and of a lim i ta tion of pow ers is only for

the pur pose of med i ta tion or Upasana. The Su preme Lord may as -

sume through Maya any form He likes in or der to please thereby his

de vout wor ship pers to save and bless them. Smriti also says, “That

thou seest me O Narada, is the Maya emit ted by me. Do not then look

on me en dowed with the qual i ties of all be ings.” The lim i ta tion of Brah -

man’s pow ers which is due to the dis tinc tion of what be longs to the

Devas and what to the body, has ref er ence to de vout med i ta tion only.

It is for the con ve nience of med i ta tion that these lim i ta tions are imag -

ined in Brah man. In His es sen tial or true na ture He is be yond them. It

fol lows, there fore, that the Be ing which scrip ture states to be within

the eye and the Sun is the Su preme Lord.

**^oXì`nXoemƒmÝ`...Ÿ&**

**Bhedavyapadesacchanyah** I.1.21 (21)
And there is another one (i.e. the Lord who is different from the
individual souls animating the Sun etc.) on account of the
declaration of distinction.

**Bheda:** difference; **Vyapadesat:** because of declaration; **Cha:** and,
also; **Anyah:** is different, another, other than the Jiva or the individual
soul.

```
An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 20 is ad duced.

More over there is one who is dis tinct from the in di vid ual souls which

an i mate the Sun and other bod ies, viz., the Lord who rules within. The

dis tinc tion be tween the Lord and the in di vid ual souls is de clared in

the fol low ing pas sage of the Srutis, “He who dwells in the Sun and is

within the Sun, whom the Sun does not know, whose body the Sun is

and who rules the Sun from within, is thy Self, the ruler within, the im -

mor tal (Bri. Up. III-7-9). Here the ex pres sion “He within the Sun whom

the Sun does not know” clearly shows that the Ruler within is dis tinct

from that cog nis ing in di vid ual soul whose body is the sun. The text

clearly in di cates that the Su preme Lord is within the Sun and yet dif -

fer ent from the in di vid ual soul iden ti fy ing it self with the Sun. This con -

firms the view ex pressed in the pre vi ous Su tra. It is an es tab lished

con clu sion that the pas sage un der dis cus sion gives a de scrip tion of

the Su preme Lord only but not of any ex alted Jiva.

Akasadhikaranam: Topic 8
The word Akasa must be understood as Brahman
```
**AmH$meñV{ëb“mV² &**

**Akasastallingat** I.1.22 (22)

The word Akasa i.e., ether here is Brahman on account of

characteristic marks (of that i.e. Brahman being mentioned).

**Akasah:** the word Akasa as used here; **Tad:** His, of Brahman;

**Lingat:** because of characteristic mark.

Brah man is shown to be Akasa in this Su tra. The Akasa of Chh.
Up. I-9 is Brah man.
In the Chhandogya Upanishad I-9 the fol low ing pas sage co mes
in. “What is the or i gin of this world? ‘Ether’ he re plied”. Be cause all
these be ings take their or i gin from the ether only, and re turn into the
ether. Ether is greater than these, ether is their ul ti mate re sort (Di a -
logue be tween Silak and Prabahana). Here the doubt arises—Does
the word ‘ether’ de note the High est Brah man or the Su preme Self or
the el e men tal ether?
Here Akasa re fers to the High est Brah man and not to the el e -
men tal ether, be cause the char ac ter is tics of Brah man, namely the or i -
gin of the en tire cre ation from it and its re turn to it at dis so lu tion are
men tioned. These marks may also re fer to Akasa as the scrip tures
say “from the Akasa sprang air, from air fire, and so on and they re turn
to the Akasa at the end of a cy cle”. But the sen tence “All these be ings
take their or i gin from the Akasa only” clearly in di cates the high est
Brah man, as all Vedanta-texts agree in pro claim ing def i nitely that all
be ings take their or i gin from the High est Brah man.
But the Purvapakshin or the op po nent may say that the el e men -
tal Akasa also may be taken as the cause viz., of air, fire and the other
el e ments. But then the force of the words “all these” and “only” in the
text quoted would be lost. To keep it, the text should be taken to re fer
to the fun da men tal cause of all, in clud ing Akasa also, which is Brah -
man alone.
The word “Akasa” is also used for Brah man in other texts: “That
which is called Akasa is the revealer of all forms and names; that
within which forms and names are, that is Brah man” Chh. Up.
VIII-14-1. The clause “They re turn into the ether” again points to Brah -
man and so also the phrase ‘Akasa is greater than these, Akasa is
their fi nal re sort’, be cause the scrip ture as cribes to the Su preme Self
only ab so lute su pe ri or ity. Chh. Up. III-14-3.
Brah man alone can be “greater than all” and their “ul ti mate goal”
as men tioned in the text. The qual i ties of be ing greater and the ul ti -
mate goal of ev ery thing are men tioned in the fol low ing texts: “He is
greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than heaven,

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 39
```

greater than all these worlds” Chh. Up. III-14-3. “Brah man is Knowl -
edge and Bliss. He is the Ul ti mate Goal of him who makes gifts” Bri.
Up. III-9-28.
The text says that all things have been born from Akasa. Such a
cau sa tion can ap ply only to Brah man. The text says that Akasa is
greater than ev ery thing else, that Akasa is the Su preme Goal and that
it is In fi nite. These in di ca tions show that Akasa means Brah man only.
Var i ous syn onyms of Akasa are used to de note Brah man. “In
which the Vedas are in the Im per ish able One (Brah man) the High est,
the ether (Vyoman)” Tait. Up. III-6. Again “OM, Ka is Brah man, ether
(Kha) is Brah man” Chh. Up IV-10-5 and “the old ether” (Bri. Up. V-1.)
There fore we are jus ti fied in de cid ing that the word Akasa,
though it oc curs in the be gin ning of the pas sage re fers to Brah man, it
is sim i lar to that of the phrase “Agni (the fire) stud ies a chap ter”,
where the word Agni, though it oc curs in the be gin ning de notes a boy.
There fore it is set tled that the word Akasa de notes Brah man only.

```
Pranadhikaranam: Topic 9
The word ‘Prana’ must be understood as Brahman
```
**AV Ed àmU...&**

**Ata eva Pranah** I.1.23 (23)

For the same reason the breath also refers to Brahman.

**Ata eva** : for the same reason; **Pranah:** the breath (also refers to
Brahman).

As Prana is de scribed as the cause of the world, such a de scrip -
tion can ap ply to Brah man alone.
“Which then is that de ity?” ‘Prana’ he said. Re gard ing the
Udgitha it is said (Chh. Up. I-10-9), ‘Prastotri’ that de ity which be longs
to the Prastava etc.
“For all the be ings merge in Prana alone and from Prana they
arise. This is the de ity be long ing to the Prastava” Chh. Up. I-11-4.
Now the doubt arises whether Prana is vi tal force or Brah man. The
Purvapakshin or op po nent says that the word Prana de notes the five -
fold breath. The Siddhantin says: No. Just as in the case of the pre -
ced ing Su tra, so here also Brah man is meant on ac count of
char ac ter is tic marks be ing men tioned; for here also a com ple men tary
pas sage makes us to un der stand that all be ings spring from and
merge into Prana. This can oc cur only in con nec tion with the Su -
preme Lord.
The op po nent says “The scrip ture makes the fol low ing state -
ment: when man sleeps, then into breath in deed speech merges, into
breath the eye, into breath the ear, into breath the mind; when he
wakes up then they spring again from breath alone.” What the Veda
here states is a mat ter of daily ob ser va tion, be cause dur ing sleep

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 40
```

when the breath ing goes on un in ter rupt edly the func tion ing of the
sense or gans ceases and again be comes man i fest when the man
wakes up only. Hence the sense or gans are the es sence of all be ings.
The com ple men tary pas sage which speaks of the merg ing and
emerg ing of the be ings can be rec on ciled with the chief vi tal air also.
This can not be. Prana is used in the sense of Brah man in pas -
sages like ‘the Prana of Prana’ (Bri. Up. IV-4-18) and ‘Prana in deed is
Brah man’ Kau. Up. III-3. The Sruti de clares “All these be ings merge in
Prana and from Prana they arise” Chh. Up. I-11-5. This is pos si ble
only if Prana is Brah man and not the vi tal force in which the senses
only get merged in deep sleep.

Jyotischaranadhikaranam: Topic 10 (Sutras 24-27)
The light is Brahman.
```
**Á`mo{VüaUm{^YmZmV² Ÿ&**

**Jyotischaranabhidhanat** I.1.24 (24)

The ‘light’ is Brahman, on account of the mention of feet in a
passage which is connected with the passage about the light.

**Jyotih:** the light; **Charana:** feet; **Abhidhanat:** because of the
mention.

The ex pres sion ‘Jyotih’ (light) is next taken up for dis cus sion.
The Jyotis of Chhandogya Upanishad III-13-7 re fers to Brah man and
not to ma te rial light; be cause it is de scribed as hav ing four feet.
Sruti de clares, “Now that light which shines above this heaven,
higher than all, higher than ev ery thing, in the high est worlds be yond
which there are no other worlds—that is the same light which is within
man.” Here the doubt arises whether the word “light” de notes the
phys i cal light of the sun and the like or the Su preme Self?
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent holds that the word ‘light’ de -
notes the light of the sun and the like as it is the or di nary well-es tab -
lished mean ing of the term. More over the word ‘shines’ or di narily
re fers to the sun and sim i lar sources of light. Brah man is colour less. It
can not be said in the pri mary sense of the word that it ‘shines’. Fur ther
the word ‘Jyotis’ de notes light for it is said to be bounded by the sky
(‘that light which shines above this heaven’); the sky can not be come
the bound ary of Brah man which is the Self of all, which is all-per vad -
ing and in fi nite, and is the source of all things mov able or im mov able.
The sky can form the bound ary of light which is mere prod uct and
which is there fore united.
The word Jyoti does not mean phys i cal light of the sun which
helps vi sion. It de notes Brah man. Why? On ac count of the feet (quar -
ters) be ing men tioned in a pre ced ing text: “Such is its great ness,
greater than this is the Purusha. One foot of It is all be ings, while its
re main ing three feet are the Im mor tal in heaven” Chh. Up. III-12-6.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 41
```

That which in this text forms the three quar ter part, im mor tal and con -
nected with heaven of Brah man which al to gether con sti tutes four
quar ters, this very same en tity is again re ferred to in the pas sage un -
der dis cus sion, for there also it is said to be con nected with heaven.
Brah man is the sub ject mat ter of not only the pre vi ous texts, but
also of the sub se quent sec tion, Sandilya Vidya (Chh. Up. III-14). If we
in ter pret ‘light’ as or di nary light, we will com mit the er ror of drop ping
the topic started and in tro duce a new sub ject. Brah man is the main
topic in the sec tion im me di ately fol low ing that which con tains the pas -
sage un der dis cus sion (Chh. Up. III-14). There fore it is quite rea son -
able to say that the in ter ven ing sec tion also (Chh. Up. III-13) treats of
Brah man only. Hence we con clude that in the pas sage the word ‘light’
must de note Brah man only.
The word ‘Jyoti’ here does not at all de note that light on which
the func tion of the eye de pends. It has dif fer ent mean ing, for in stance
“with speech only as light man sits” (Bri. Up. IV-3-5); what ever il lu -
mines some thing else may be con sid ered as ‘light’. There fore the
term ‘light’ may be ap plied to Brah man also whose na ture is in tel li -
gence be cause It gives light to the whole uni verse. The Srutis de clare
“Him the shin ing one, ev ery thing shines af ter; by His light all this is il -
lu mined” (Kau. Up. II-5-15) and “Him the gods wor ship as the Light of
lights, as the Im mor tal” (Bri. Up. IV-4-16).
The men tion of lim it ing ad juncts with re spect to Brah man, de -
noted by the word ‘light’ ‘bounded by heaven’ and the as sign ment of a
spe cial lo cal ity serves the pur pose of de vout med i ta tion. The Srutis
speak of dif fer ent kinds of med i ta tion on Brah man as spe cially con -
nected with cer tain lo cal i ties such as the sun, the eye, the heart.
There fore it is a set tled con clu sion that the word ‘light’ here de -
notes Brah man.

**Chhando’bhidhananneti chet na tatha
cheto’rpananigadat tatha hi darsanam** I.1.25 (25)

If it be said that Brahman is not denoted on account of the
metre Gayatri being denoted, we reply not so, because thus i.e.
by means of the metre the application of the mind on Brahman
is declared; because thus it is seen (in other passages also).

**Chhandas:** the metre known as Gayatri; **Abhidhanat:** because of
the description; **Na:** not; **Iti** : thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not; **Tatha:** thus, like
that; **Chet’orpana:** application of the mind; **Nigadat:** because of the
teaching; **Tatha hi:** like that; **Darsanam:** it is seen (in other texts).

```
An ob jec tion raised against Su tra 24 is re futed in this Su tra.
```
```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 42
```

The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says “In the pas sage, ‘One
foot of It is all be ings’,” Brah man is not re ferred to but the metre
Gayatri, be cause the first para graph of the pre ced ing sec tion of the
same Upanishad be gins with “Gayatri is ev ery thing, what so ever here
ex ists”. Hence the feet re ferred to in the text men tioned in the pre vi -
ous Su tra re fer to this metre and not to Brah man.
In re ply we say, not so; be cause the Brahmana pas sage
“Gayatri in deed is all this” teaches that one should med i tate on the
Brah man which is con nected with this metre, for Brah man be ing the
cause of ev ery thing is con nected with that Gayatri also and it is that
Brah man which is to be med i tated upon.
Brah man is med i tated upon as Gayatri. By this ex pla na tion all
be come con sis tent. If Gayatri meant metre then it would be im pos si -
ble to say of it that “Gayatri is ev ery thing what so ever here ex ists” be -
cause cer tainly the metre is not ev ery thing. There fore the Su tra says
_“Tatha hi darsanam”_ —So we see. By such an ex pla na tion only the
above pas sage gives a con sis tent mean ing. Oth er wise we will have
to hold a metre to be ev ery thing which is ab surd. There fore through
Gayatri the med i ta tion on Brah man is shown.
The di rec tion of the mind is de clared in the text ‘Gayatri is all
this’. The pas sage in structs that by means of the metre Gayatri the
mind is to be di rected on Brah man which is con nected with that
metre.
This in ter pre ta tion is in ac cor dance with the other texts in the
same sec tion e.g. “All this in deed is Brah man” Chh. Up. III-14-1
where Brah man is the chief topic.
De vout med i ta tion on Brah man through its mod i fi ca tions or ef -
fects is men tioned in other pas sages also; for in stance, Ait. Ar.
III-2-3.12 “it is the Su preme Be ing un der the name of Gayatri, whom
the Bahvrichas wor ship as Mahat-Uktha i.e. Maha Prana, the
Adhvaryu priests as Agni (fire), and the Chandoga priests as Maha
Vrata (the great est rite).”
There fore Brah man is meant here and not the metre Gayatri.

**^yVm{XnmXì`nXoemonnÎmoü¡d_² Ÿ&**

**Bhutadipadavyapadesopapatteschaivam** I.1.26 (26)
And thus also (we must conclude, viz., that Brahman is the
subject or topic of the previous passage, where Gayatri occurs)
because (thus only) the declaration as to the beings etc. being
the feet is possible.

**Bhutadi:** the elements etc. i.e. the elements, the earth, the body and
the heart; **Pada:** (of) foot, part; **Vyapadesa:** (of) mention (of)
declaration or expression; **Upapatteh:** because of the possibility or
proof, reasonableness, as it is rightly deduced from the above
reasons; **Cha:** also; **Evam:** thus, so.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 43
```

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is ad duced.
The be ings, earth, body and heart can be felt only of Brah man
and not of Gayatri, the metre, a mere col lec tion of syl la bles. The pre -
vi ous pas sage has only Brah man for its topic or sub ject, be cause the
text des ig nates the be ings and so on as the feet of Gayatri. The text at
first speaks of the be ings, the earth, the body and the heart and then
goes on de scrib ing “that Gayatri has four feet and is six fold”. If Brah -
man were not meant, there would be no room for the verse “such is
the great ness” etc.
Hence by Gayatri is here meant Brah man as con nected with the
metre Gayatri. It is this Brah man particularised by Gayatri that is said
to be the Self of ev ery thing in the pas sage “Gayatri is ev ery thing” etc.
There fore Brah man is to be re garded as the sub ject mat ter of
the pre vi ous pas sage also. This same Brah man is again re cog nised
as light in Chh. Up. III-12-7.
The el e ments, the earth, the body and the heart can not be rep -
re sented as the four verses of Gayatri. They can be un der stood only
to mean the four fold man i fes ta tions of the Su preme Be ing. The word
“heaven” is a sig nif i cant word. Its use in con nec tion with ‘light’ re -
minds us of its use in con nec tion with the ‘Gayatri’ also. There fore the
‘light’ shin ing above heaven is the same as the ‘Gayatri’ that has three
of its feet in heaven.

**CnXoe^oXmÞo{V MoV² Z C^`pñ_Þß`{damoYmV² &**

**Upadesabhedanneti chet na ubhayasminnapyavirodhat** I.1.27 (27)
If it be said (that Brahman of the Gayatri passage cannot be
recognised in the passage treating of ‘light’) on account of the
difference of designation or the specification (we reply) no,
because in either (designation) there is nothing contrary (to the
recognition).

**Upadesa** : of teaching of grammatical construction or cases; **Bhedat:**
because of the difference; **Na:** not; **Iti chet:** if it be said; **Na:** no;
**Ubhayasmin:** in both, (whether in the ablative case or in the locative
case); **Api:** even; **Avirodhat:** because there is no contradiction.

An other ob jec tion against Su tra 24 is raised and re futed. If it be
ar gued that there is a dif fer ence of ex pres sion con sist ing in case-end -
ing in the Gayatri-Sruti and in the Jyoti Sruti re gard ing the word ‘Div’
(heaven) then the re ply is ‘No’; the ar gu ment is not ten a ble, as there is
no ma te rial con tra dic tion be tween the two ex pres sions.
In the Gayatri pas sage “three feet of it are what is im mor tal in
heaven”, heaven is des ig nated as the abode of Brah man; while in the
lat ter pas sage “that light which shines above this heaven”, Brah man
is de scribed as ex ist ing above heaven. One may ob ject that the sub -
ject mat ter of the for mer pas sage can not be re cog nised in the lat ter.
The ob jec tor may say “how then can one and the same Brah man be

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 44
```

re ferred to in both the texts?” It can; there can be no con tra dic tion
here. Just as in or di nary lan guage a bird, al though in con tact with the
top of a tree, is not only said to be on the tree, but also above the tree,
so Brah man also, al though be ing in heaven, is here re ferred to as be -
ing be yond heaven as well.
The locative “Divi” in heaven and the ab la tive ‘Divah’ above
heaven are not con trary. The dif fer ence in the case-end ing of the
word “Div” is no con tra dic tion as the locative case (the sev enth
case-end ing) is of ten used in the scrip tural texts to ex press sec ond -
arily the mean ing of the ab la tive (the fifth case-end ing).
There fore the Brah man spo ken of in the for mer pas sage can be
re cog nised in the lat ter also. It is a set tled con clu sion that the word
“light” de notes Brah man.
Though the gram mat i cal cases used in the scrip tural pas sage
are not iden ti cal, the ob ject of the ref er ence is clearly re cog nised as
be ing iden ti cal.

Pratardanadhikaranam: Topic 11 (Sutras 28-31)
Prana is Brahman
```
**àmUñVWmZwJ_mV² &**

**Pranastathanugamat** I.1.28 (28)

Prana is Brahman, that being so understood from a connected
consideration (of the passage referring to Prana).

**Pranah:** the breath or life-energy; **Tatha:** thus, so, likewise like that
stated before; like that stated in the Sruti quoted before in connection
therewith; **Anugamat:** because of being understood (from the texts).

The ex pres sion ‘Prana’ is again taken up for dis cus sion.
In the Kaushitaki Upanishad there oc curs the con ver sa tion be -
tween Indra and Pratardana. Pratardana, the son of Divodasa, came
by means of fight ing and strength to the abode of Indra. Pratardana
said to Indra, “You your self choose for me that boon which you think is
most ben e fi cial to man”. Indra re plied, “Know me only. This is what I
think most ben e fi cial to man. I am Prana, the in tel li gent Self
(Prajnatman). Med i tate on me as life, as im mor tal ity” III-2. “That
Prana is in deed the in tel li gent Self, bliss, undecaying, im mor tal” III-8.
Here the doubt arises whether the word Prana de notes merely
breath, the mod i fi ca tion of air or the God Indra, or the in di vid ual soul,
or the high est Brah man.
The word ‘Prana’ in the pas sage re fers to Brah man, be cause it
is de scribed as the most con du cive to hu man wel fare. Noth ing is
more con du cive to hu man wel fare than the knowl edge of Brah man.
More over Prana is de scribed as Prajnatma. The air which is non-in -
tel li gent can clearly not be the in tel li gent Self.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 1 45
```

Those char ac ter is tic marks which are men tioned in the con clud -
ing pas sage, viz., ‘bliss’ (Ananda), undecaying (Ajara), im mor tal (Am -
ri ta) can be true only of Brah man. Fur ther knowl edge of Prana
ab solves one from all sins. “He who knows me thus by no deed of his
is his life harmed, nei ther by ma tri cide nor by pat ri cide” Kau. Up. III-1.
All this can be prop erly un der stood only if the Su preme Self or
the high est Brah man is ac knowl edged to be the sub ject mat ter of the
pas sages, and not if the vi tal air is sub sti tuted in its place. Hence the
word ‘Prana’ de notes Brah man only.

**Na vakturatmopadesaditi chet
adhyatmasambandhabhuma hyasmin** I.1.29 (29)

If it be said that (Brahman is) not (denoted or referred in these
passages on account of) the speaker’s instruction about
himself, we reply not so, because there is abundance of
reference to the Inner Self in this (chapter or Upanishad).

**Na:** not; **Vaktuh:** of the speaker (Indra); **Atma:** of the Self; **Upadesat:**
on account of instruction; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Adhyatma sambandha
bhuma:** abundance of reference to the Inner Self; **Hi:** because;
**Asmin:** in this (chapter or Upanishad).

An ob jec tion to Su tra 28 is re futed.
An ob jec tion is raised against the as ser tion that Prana de notes
Brah man. The op po nent or Purvapakshin says, “The word Prana
does not de note the Su preme Brah man, be cause the speaker Indra
des ig nates him self.” Indra speaks to Pratardana, “Know me only. I am
Prana, the in tel li gent Self.” How can the Prana which re fers to a per -
son al ity be Brah man to which the at trib ute of be ing a speaker can not
be as cribed. The Sruti de clares, “Brah man is with out speech, with out
mind” Bri. Up. III-8-8.
Fur ther on, also Indra, the speaker glo ri fies him self, “I slew the
three-headed son of Tvashtri. I de liv ered the Arunmukhas, the dev o -
tees to the wolves (Salavrika). I killed the peo ple of Prahlada” and so
on. Indra may be called Prana ow ing to his strength. Hence Prana
does not de note Brah man.
This ob jec tion is not valid be cause there are found abun dant
ref er ences to Brah man or the In ner Self in that chap ter. They are
“Prana, the in tel li gent Self, alone hav ing laid hold of this body makes it
rise up”. For as in a car the cir cum fer ence of the wheel is set on the
spokes and the spokes on the nave; thus are these ob jects set on the
sub jects (the senses) and the sub jects on the Prana. And that Prana
in deed is the Self of Prajna, blessed (Ananda), undecaying (Ajara)
and im mor tal (Am ri ta). “He is my Self, thus let it be known”. “This Self
is Brah man, Om ni scient” Bri. Up. II-5-19.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 46
```

```
Indra said to Pratardana, “Wor ship me as Prana”. This can only
```
re fer to Brah man. For the wor ship of Brah man alone can give Mukti or
the fi nal eman ci pa tion which is most ben e fi cial to man (Hitatma). It is

said of this Prana, “For he (Prana) makes him, whom he wishes to

lead out from these worlds, do a good deed.” This shows that the

Prana is the great cause that makes ev ery ac tiv ity pos si ble. This also

is con sis tent with Brah man and not with breath or Indra. Hence
‘Prana’ here de notes Brah man only.
The chap ter con tains in for ma tion re gard ing Brah man only ow -

ing to plenty of ref er ences to the In ner Self, not re gard ing the self of

some de ity.
But if Indra re ally meant to teach the wor ship of Brah man, why

does he say “wor ship me”? It is re ally mis lead ing. To this the fol low ing

Su tra gives the proper an swer.

and with Brahman) is possible through intuition as attested by
Sruti, as in the case of Vamadeva.

**Sastradrishtya:** through insight based on scripture or as attested by
Sruti; **Tu:** but; **Upadesah:** instruction; **Vamadevavat:** like that of
Vamadeva.

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 29 is fur ther re futed.
The word ‘tu’ (but) re moves the doubt. Indra’s de scrib ing him -
self as Prana is quite suit able as he iden ti fies him self with Brah man in

that in struc tion to Pratardana like the sage Vamadeva.
Sage Vamadeva real ised Brah man and said “I was Manu and

Surya” which is in ac cor dance with the pas sage “What ever Deva

knew Brah man be came That” (Bri. Up. I-4-10). Indra’s in struc tion also

is like that. Hav ing real ised Brah man by means of Rishi-like in tu ition,

Indra iden ti fies him self in the in struc tion with the Su preme Brah man
and in structs Pratardana about the High est Brah man by means of the

words ‘Know me only’.
Indra praises the knowl edge of Brah man. There fore it is not his

own glo ri fi ca tion when he says ‘I killed Tvashtri’s son’ etc. The mean -

ing of the pas sage is ‘Al though I do such cruel ac tions, yet not even a

hair of mine is harmed be cause I am one with Brah man. There fore
the life of any other per son also who knows me thus is not harmed by

any deed of his. Indra says in a sub se quent pas sage ‘I am Prana, the

in tel li gent Self.’ There fore the whole chap ter re fers to Brah man only.

**Jivamukhyapranalinganneti chet na upasatraividhyat
asritatvadiha tadyogat** I.1.31 (31)

If it be said that (Brahman is) not (meant) on account of
characteristic marks of the individual soul and the chief vital
air (being mentioned); we say no, because (such an
interpretation) would enjoin threefold meditation (Upasana),
because Prana has been accepted (elsewhere in the Sruti in
the sense of Brahman) and because here also (words denoting
Brahman) are mentioned with reference to Prana.

**Jivamukhyapranalingat:** on account of the characteristic marks of
the individual soul and the chief vital air; **Na:** not; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:**
not; **Upasana:** worship, meditation; **Traividhyat:** because of the
three ways; **Asritatvat:** on account of Prana being accepted
(elsewhere in Sruti in the sense of Brahman); **Iha:** in the Kaushitaki
passage; **Tadyogat:** because of its appropriateness; as they have
been applied; because words denoting Brahman are mentioned with
reference to Prana.

But an other ob jec tion is raised. What is the ne ces sity of this
Adhikarana again, “med i ta tion of Prana” and iden ti fy ing Prana with
Brah man, when in the pre ced ing Su tra, I-1-23 it has been shown that
Prana means Brah man?
To this we an swer: this Adhikarana is not a re dun dancy. In the
Su tra I-1-23, the doubt was only with re gard to the mean ing of the sin -
gle word Prana. In this Adhikarana the doubt was not about the mean -
ing of the word Prana, but about the whole pas sage, in which there
are words, and marks or in di ca tions that would have led a per son
med i tat ing, to think that there also Jiva and breath meant to be med i -
tated upon. To re move this doubt, it is de clared that Brah man alone is
the topic of dis cus sion in this Kaushitaki Upanishad and not Jiva or vi -
tal breath.
There fore this Adhikarana has been sep a rately stated by the
au thor.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent holds that Prana does not
de note Brah man, but ei ther the in di vid ual soul or the chief vi tal air or
both. He says that the chap ter men tions the char ac ter is tic marks of
the in di vid ual soul on the one hand, and of the chief vi tal air on the
other hand.
The pas sage ‘One should know the speaker and not en quire
into speech’ (Kau. Up. III-4) men tions a char ac ter is tic mark of the in di -
vid ual soul. The pas sage “Prana, lay ing hold of his body, makes it rise
up” Kau. Up. III. 3 points to the chief vi tal air be cause the chief at trib -
ute of the vi tal air is that it sus tains the body. Then there is an other

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 48
```

pas sage, ‘Then Prana said to the or gans: be not de ceived. I alone di -
vid ing my self five fold sup port this body and keep it’ Prasna Up. II-3.
Then again you will find ‘What is Prana, that is Prajna; what is Prajna,
that is Prana.’
This Su tra re futes such a view and says, that Brah man alone is
re ferred to by ‘Prana’, be cause the above in ter pre ta tion would in volve
a three fold Upasana, viz., of the in di vid ual soul, of the chief vi tal air,
and of Brah man. Which is cer tainly against the ac cepted rules of in -
ter pre ta tion of the scrip tures. It is in ap pro pri ate to as sume that a sin -
gle sen tence en joins three kinds of wor ship or med i ta tion.
Fur ther in the be gin ning we have “know me only” fol lowed by “I
am Prana, in tel li gent Self, med i tate on me as life, as im mor tal ity”; and
in the end again we read “And that Prana in deed is the in tel li gent Self,
blessed (Ananda), undecaying (Ajara) and im mor tal (Am ri ta).” The
be gin ning and the con clud ing part are thus seen to be sim i lar. There -
fore we must con clude that they re fer to one and the same sub ject
and that the same sub ject-mat ter is kept up through out.
There fore ‘Prana’ must de note Brah man only. In the case of
other pas sages where char ac ter is tic marks of Brah man are men -
tioned the word ‘Prana’ is taken in the sense of Brah man. It is a set tled
con clu sion that Brah man is the topic or sub ject mat ter of the whole
chap ter.

INTRODUCTION
```
In the First Pada or Sec tion Brah man has been shown to be the
cause of the or i gin, sus te nance and dis so lu tion of the whole uni verse.
It has been taught that the Su preme Brah man should be en quired
into. Cer tain at trib utes such as Eter nity, Om ni science,
All-pervadingness, the Self of all and so on have been de clared of the
Brah man.
In the lat ter part of Sec tion I cer tain terms in the Sruti such as
Anandamaya, Jyoti, Prana, Akasa, etc., used in a dif fer ent sense
have been shown through rea son ing to re fer to Brah man. Cer tain
pas sages of the scrip tures about whose sense doubts are en ter -
tained and which con tain clear char ac ter is tics of Brah man
(Spashta-Brahmalinga) have been shown to re fer to Brah man.
Now in this and the next Sec tion some more pas sages of doubt -
ful im port wherein the char ac ter is tic marks of Brah man are not so ap -
par ent (Aspashta-Brahmalinga) are taken up for dis cus sion. Doubts
may arise as to the ex act mean ing of cer tain ex pres sions of Sruti,
whether they in di cate Brah man or some thing else. Those ex pres -

In the Sec ond and Third Padas will be shown that cer tain other

**SYNOPSIS**
Doubts may arise as to the ex act mean ing of cer tain ex pres -
sions of Sruti, whether they in di cate Brah man or some thing else.
These ex pres sions are taken up for dis cus sion in this and the next
sec tions.
It is proved in this sec tion that the dif fer ent ex pres sions used in
dif fer ent Srutis for Di vine con tem pla tion in di cate the same In fi nite
Brah man.
In the Sandilya Vidya of the Chhandogya Upanishad it is said
that as the form and the char ac ter of a per son in his next life are de ter -
mined by his de sires and thoughts of the pres ent one, he should con -
stantly de sire for and med i tate upon Brah man who is per fect, who is
Sat-Chit-Ananda, who is im mor tal, who is Self-lu mi nous, who is eter -
nal, pure, birthless, death less, In fi nite etc., so that he may be come
iden ti cal with Him.
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1 to 8) shows that the be ing which con -
sists of mind, whose body is breath etc., men tioned in Chhandogya
Upanishad III-14 is not the in di vid ual soul, but Brah man.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Sutras 9 and 10) de cides that he to whom the
Brahmanas and Kshatriyas are but food (Katha Up. I-2-25) is the Su -
preme Self or Brah man.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 11 and 12) shows that the two which en -
tered into the cave (Katha Up. I-3-1) are Brah man and the in di vid ual
soul.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Sutras 13 to 17) states that the per son within
the eye men tioned in Chh. Up. IV-15-1 in di cates nei ther a re flected
im age nor any in di vid ual soul, but Brah man.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 18 to 20) shows that the In ner Ruler
within (Antaryamin) de scribed in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
III-7-3 as per vad ing and guid ing the five el e ments (earth, wa ter, fire,
air, ether) and also heaven, sun, moon, stars etc., is no other than
Brah man.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 21 to 23) proves that which can not be
seen, etc., men tioned in Mundaka Upanishad I-1-6 is Brah man.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 24 to 32) shows that the At man, the
Vaisvanara of Chhandogya Upanishad V-11-6 is Brah man.
The opin ions of dif fer ent sages namely Jaimini, Asmarathya
and Badari have also been given here to show that the In fi nite Brah -
man is some times con ceived as fi nite and as pos sess ing head, trunk,
feet and other limbs and or gans in or der to fa cil i tate di vine con tem pla -
tion ac cord ing to the ca pac ity of the meditator.

Sarvatra Prasiddhyadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-8)
The Manomaya is Brahman.
```
**gd©Ìà{gÕmonXoemV² Ÿ&**

**Sarvatra prasiddhopadesat** I.2.1 (32)

(That which consists of the mind ‘Manomaya’ is Brahman)
because there is taught (in this text) (that Brahman which is)

well-known (as the cause of the world) in the Upanishads.

**Sarvatra:** everywhere, in every Vedantic passage i.e., in all
Upanishads; **Prasiddha:** the well-known; **Upadesat:** because of the
teaching.

Sruti de clares, “All this in deed is Brah man, em a nat ing from Him,
liv ing and mov ing in Him, and ul ti mately dis solv ing in Him; thus know -
ing let a man med i tate with a calm mind.” A man in his pres ent life is
the out come of his pre vi ous thoughts and de sires. He be comes that in
af ter-life what he now re solves to be. There fore he should med i tate
on Brah man who is ide ally per fect, who func tions through his very
life-en ergy and who is all-light. “He who con sists of the mind, whose
body is Prana (the sub tle body) etc.” Chh. Up. III-14.
Now a doubt arises whether what is pointed out as the ob ject of
med i ta tion by means of at trib utes such as con sist ing of mind, etc., is
the in di vid ual soul or the Su preme Brah man.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: the pas sage re fers to
the in di vid ual soul only. Why? Be cause the em bod ied self only is con -
nected with the mind. This is a well-known fact, while the Su preme
Brah man is not. It is said in the Mundaka Upanishad II-1-2 ‘He is with -
out breath, with out mind, pure.’
The pas sage does not aim at en join ing med i ta tion on Brah man.
It aims only at en join ing calm ness of mind. The other at trib utes also
sub se quently stated in the text “He to whom all works, all de sires be -
long” re fer to the in di vid ual soul.
The Srutis de clare “He is my Self within the heart, smaller than a
corn of rice, smaller than a corn of bar ley.” This re fers to the in di vid ual
soul which has the size of the point of a goad, but not to the in fi nite or
un lim ited Brah man.
We re ply: The Su preme Brah man only is what is to be med i tated
upon as dis tin guished by the at trib utes of con sist ing of mind and so
on. Be cause the text be gins with “All this in deed is Brah man.” That
Brah man which is con sid ered as the cause of the world in all scrip -
tural pas sages is taught here also in the for mula “Tajjalan”. As the be -
gin ning re fers to Brah man, the lat ter pas sage where “He who
con sists of the mind” (Manomaya) oc curs, should also re fer to Brah -
man as dis tin guished by cer tain qual i ties. Thus we avoid the fault of
drop ping the sub ject-mat ter un der dis cus sion and un nec es sar ily in -

tro duc ing a fresh topic. Fur ther the text speaks of Upasana, med i ta -
tion. There fore it is but proper that Brah man which is de scribed in all
other pas sages as an ob ject of med i ta tion is also taught here and not
the in di vid ual soul. The in di vid ual soul is not spo ken of any where as
an ob ject of med i ta tion or Upasana.
More over you can at tain se ren ity by med i tat ing on Brah man
which is an em bodi ment of peace. Manomaya re fers to Brah man in
Mun. Up. II-2-7, Tait. Up. I-6-1 and Katha Up. VII-9. The well-known
Manomaya, ap plied in all the above pas sages to Brah man, is re ferred
to here in the Chhandogya also. There fore Manomaya re fers to the
Su preme Brah man only.

**{dd{jVJwUmonnÎmoüŸ&**

**Vivakshitagunopapattescha** I.2.2 (33)

Moreover the qualities desired to be expressed are possible (in
Brahman; therefore the passage refers to Brahman).

**Vivakshita:** desired to be expressed; **Guna:** qualities; **Upapatteh:**
because of the reasonableness, for the justification; **Cha:** and,
moreover.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is ad duced. And be cause the
at trib utes, sought to be ap plied by the Sruti quoted above, justly be -
long to Brah man, it must be ad mit ted that the pas sage re fers to Brah -
man.
“He who con sists of the mind, whose body is Prana (the sub tle
body), whose form is light, re solve is true, whose na ture is like that of
ether (Om ni pres ent and in vis i ble), from whom pro ceed all ac tions, all
de sires, all scents, all tastes; who is All-em brac ing, who is voice less
and un at tached” Chh. Up. III-14-2. These at trib utes men tioned in this
text as top ics of med i ta tion are pos si ble in Brah man only.
The qual i ties of hav ing true de sires (Sat Kama) and true pur -
poses (Sat Sankalpa) are at trib uted to the Su preme Self in an other
pas sage viz., ‘The Self which is free from sin etc.’ Chh. Up. VIII-7-1,
“He whose Self is the ether”; this is pos si ble as Brah man which as the
cause of the en tire uni verse is the Self of ev ery thing and is also the
Self of the ether. Thus the qual i ties here in ti mated as top ics of med i ta -
tion agree with the na ture of Brah man.
Hence, as the qual i ties men tioned are pos si ble in Brah man, we
con clude that the Su preme Brah man alone is rep re sented as the ob -
ject of med i ta tion.

**AZwnnÎmoñVw Z emara...**

**Anupapattestu na saarirah** I.2.3 (34)
On the other hand, as (those qualities) are not possible (in it)
the embodied (soul is) not (denoted by Manomaya etc.).

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 2 53
```

**Anupapatteh:** not being justifiable, because of the impossibility,

because of the unreasonableness, because they are not appropriate;

**Tu:** but on the other hand; **Na:** not; **Saarirah:** the embodied, the Jiva

or the individual soul.

Such qual i ties can not ap ply to the in di vid ual soul. The ar gu ment
in sup port of the Su tra is con tin ued. The pre ced ing Su tra has stated
that the qual i ties men tioned are pos si ble in Brah man. The pres ent
Su tra de clares that they are not pos si ble in the Jiva or the em bod ied
Soul. Brah man only is en dowed with the qual i ties of ‘con sist ing of
mind or Manomaya, and so on’ but not the em bod ied Self.
Be cause the qual i ties such as ‘He whose pur poses are true,
whose Self is the ether, who is speech less, who is not dis turbed, who
is greater than the earth’ can not be as cribed to the in di vid ual soul.
The term ‘Saarira’ or em bod ied means ‘dwell ing in a body.’
If the op po nent says ‘The Lord also dwells in the body’, we re ply:
true, He does abide in the body, but not in the body alone; be cause
Sruti de clares ‘The Lord is greater than the earth, greater than the
heaven, Om ni pres ent like the ether, eter nal.’ On the con trary the in di -
vid ual soul re sides in the body only.
The Jiva is like a glow-worm be fore the ef ful gence of the Brah -
man who is like a Sun when com pared with it. The su pe rior qual i ties
de scribed in the text are not cer tainly pos si ble in Jiva.
The All-per vad ing is not the em bod ied self or the in di vid ual soul,
as it is quite im pos si ble to pred i cate Om ni pres ence of Him. It is im -
pos si ble and against fact and rea son also that one and the same in di -
vid ual could be in all the bod ies at the same time.

**H$_©H$V©¥ì`nXoemƒŸ&**

**Karmakartrivyapadesaccha** I.2.4 (35)

Because of the declaration of the attainer and the object
attained. He who consists of the mind (Manomaya) refers to
Brahman and not to the individual soul.

**Karma:** object; **Kartri:** agent; **Vyapadesat:** because of the

declaration or mention; **Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 3 is ad duced.
A sep a rate dis tinc tion is drawn be tween the ob ject of ac tiv ity
and of the agent. There fore the at trib utes of ‘con sist ing of mind’
(Manomaya) can not be long to the em bod ied self. The text says
“When I shall have de parted from hence I shall ob tain him” Chh. Up.
III-14-4. Here the word ‘Him’ re fers to that which is the topic of dis cus -
sion. “Who con sists of the mind, the ob ject of med i ta tion” viz., as
some thing to be ob tained; while the words ‘I shall ob tain’ rep re sent
the med i tat ing in di vid ual soul as the agent i.e., the obtainer.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 54
```

We must not as sume that one and the same thing is spo ken of
as the attainer (agent) and the ob ject at tained at the same time. The
attainer and the at tained can not be the same. The ob ject med i tated
upon is dif fer ent from the per son who med i tates, the in di vid ual soul
re ferred to in the above text by the pro noun ‘I’.
Thus for the above rea son also, that which is char ac ter ised by
the at trib utes con sist ing of mind ‘Manomaya’ and so on, can not be
the in di vid ual soul.

**eãX{deofmV² &**

**Sabdaviseshat** I.2.5 (36)

Because of the difference of words.

**Sabda:** word; Viseshat: because of difference.

The ar gu ment in fa vour of Su tra 1 is con tin ued. That which pos -
sesses the at trib utes of “con sist ing of mind” and so on can not be the
in di vid ual soul, be cause there is a dif fer ence of words.
In the Satapatha Brahmana the same idea is ex pressed in sim i -
lar words “As is a grain of rice, or a grain of bar ley, or a ca nary seed or
the ker nel of a ca nary seed”, so is that golden per son in the Self (X.
6-3-2). Here one word i.e. the locative “in the Self” de notes the in di -
vid ual soul or the em bod ied self, and a dif fer ent word, viz. the nom i na -
tive ‘per son’ de notes the self dis tin guished by the at trib utes of
con sist ing of mind etc.
We, there fore, con clude that the two are dif fer ent and that the
in di vid ual self is not re ferred to in the text un der dis cus sion.

**ñ_¥VoüŸ&**

**Smritescha** I.2.6 (37)

From the Smriti also (we know the embodied self or the
individual soul is different from the one referred to in the text
under discussion).

**Smriteh:** from the Smriti; **Cha:** and, also.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
It is so de clared also in the Smriti (Bhagavad Gita). From the
Smriti also it is ev i dent that the in di vid ual soul is mark edly dif fer ent
from the sub ject mat ter of the text un der dis cus sion.
Smriti also de clares the dif fer ence of the in di vid ual soul and the
Su preme Soul “The Lord dwelleth in the hearts of all be ings, O
Arjuna, by His il lu sive power, caus ing all be ings to re volve, as though
mounted on a pot ter’s wheel” (Gita: XVIII-61).
The dif fer ence is only imag i nary and not real. The dif fer ence ex -
ists only so long as Avidya or ig no rance lasts and the sig nif i cance of
the Mahavakya or Great Sen tence of the Upanishads ‘Tat Tvam Asi’
(Thou art That) has not been real ised. As soon as you grasp the truth

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 2 55
```

that there is only one uni ver sal Self, there is an end to Samsara or
phe nom e nal life with its dis tinc tion of bond age, fi nal eman ci pa tion
and the like.

**A^©H$m¡H$ñËdmÎmX²ì`nXoemƒ Zo{V MoÞ {ZMmæ`ËdmXod§ ì`mo_dƒŸ&>**

**Arbhakaukastvattadvyapadesaccha neti chet na
nichayyatvadevam vyomavaccha** I.2.7 (38)

If it be said that (the passage does) not (refer to Brahman) on
account of the smallness of the abode (mentioned i.e. the
heart) and also on account of the denotation of that (i.e. of
minuteness) we say, No; because (Brahman) has thus to be
meditated and because the case is similar to that of ether.

**Arbhakaukastvat:** because of the smallness of the abode;
**Tadvyapadesat:** because of the description or denotation as such
i.e. minuteness; **Cha:** and also; **Na:** not; **Iti:** not so; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not;
**Nichayyatvat:** because of meditation (in the heart); **Evam:** thus, so;
**Vyomavat:** like the ether; **Cha:** and.

An ob jec tion to Su tra 1 is raised and re futed.
Now an ob jec tion is raised, that the Manomaya of the
Chhandogya Upanishad can not be Brah man, but is Jiva, be cause the
de scrip tion there is more ap pli ca ble to an in di vid ual soul than to Brah -
man. The text says “He is my self within the heart, smaller than a corn
of rice, smaller than a mus tard seed” Chh. Up. III-14-3. This shows
that the Manomaya oc cu pies very lit tle space, in fact it is atomic and
so can not be Brah man.
This Su tra re futes it. Though a man is the king of the whole
earth, he could at the same time be called the king of Ayodhya as well.
The In fi nite is called the atomic be cause He can be real ised in the
min ute space of the cham ber of the heart, just as Lord Vishnu can be
real ised in the sa cred stone called Saligrama.
Al though pres ent ev ery where, the Lord is pleased when med i -
tated upon as abid ing in the heart. The case is sim i lar to that of the
eye of the nee dle. The ether, though all-per vad ing, is spo ken of as
lim ited and min ute, with ref er ence to its con nec tion with the eye of the
nee dle. So it is said of Brah man also.
The at trib utes of lim i ta tion of abode and of mi nute ness are as -
cribed to Brah man only for the con ve nience of con cep tion and med i -
ta tion, be cause it is dif fi cult to med i tate on the all-per vad ing, in fi nite
Brah man. This will cer tainly not go against His Om ni pres ence. These
lim i ta tions are sim ply imag ined in Brah man. They are not at all real.
In the very pas sage Brah man is de clared to be in fi nite like
space, and all-per vad ing like ether, ‘Greater than the earth, greater
than the sky, greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds.’
Though Brah man is all-per vad ing, yet He be comes atomic through
His mys te ri ous in con ceiv able power to please His dev o tees. He ap -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 56
```

pears si mul ta neously ev ery where, wher ever His dev o tees are. This
si mul ta neous ap pear ance of the atomic Brah man ev ery where es tab -
lishes His all-pervadingness even in His man i fested form. Gopis saw
Lord Krishna ev ery where.
The op po nent says: If Brah man has His abode in the heart,
which heart-abode is a dif fer ent one in each body, it would fol low, that
He is at tended by all the im per fec tions which at tach to be ings hav ing
dif fer ent abodes, such as par rots shut up in dif fer ent cages viz., want
of unity be ing made up of parts, non-per ma nency, etc. He would be
sub ject to ex pe ri ences orig i nat ing from con nec tion with bod ies. To
this the au thor gives a suit able re ply in the fol low ing Su tra.

**gå^moJàm{á[a{V MoV² Z d¡eoî`mV² Ÿ&**

**Sambhogapraptiriti chet na vaiseshyat** I.2.8 (39)
If it be said that (being connected with the hearts of all
individual souls to) Its (Brahman’s) Omnipresence, it would
also have experience (of pleasure and pain) (we say) not so, on
account of the difference in the nature (of the two).

**Sambhogaprapti:** that it has experience of pleasure and pain; **Iti:**
thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not; **Vaiseshyat:** because of the difference in
nature.

An other ob jec tion is raised and re futed here.
The word ‘Sambhoga’ de notes mu tual ex pe ri ence or com mon
ex pe ri ence. The force of ‘Sam’ in ‘Sambhoga’ is that of ‘Saha’. The
mere dwell ing within a body is not a cause al ways of ex pe ri enc ing the
plea sures or pains con nected with that body. The ex pe ri ence is sub -
ject to the in flu ence of the good and evil ac tions. Brah man has no
such Karma. He is ac tion less (Nishkriya, Akarta). In the Gita the Lord
says, “The Kar mas do not touch Me and I have no at tach ment to the
fruit of Kar mas— _Na mam karmani limpanti na me karmaphale

There is no equal ity in ex pe ri ence be tween Brah man and the in -
di vid ual soul, be cause Brah man is all-per vad ing, of ab so lute power;
the in di vid ual soul is of lit tle power and ab so lutely de pend ent.
Though Brah man is all-per vad ing and con nected with hearts of
all in di vid ual souls and is also in tel li gent like them, He is not sub ject to
plea sure and pain. Be cause the in di vid ual soul is an agent, he is the
doer of good and bad ac tions. There fore he ex pe ri ences plea sure
and pain. Brah man is not the doer. He is the eter nal Satchidananda.
He is free from all evil.
The op po nent says: The in di vid ual soul is in es sence iden ti cal
with Brah man. There fore Brah man is also sub ject to the plea sure and
pain ex pe ri enced by the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul. This is a fool ish ar -
gu ment. This is a fal lacy. In re al ity there is nei ther the in di vid ual soul
nor plea sure and pain. Plea sure and pain are men tal cre ations only.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 2 57
```

When the in di vid ual soul is un der the in flu ence of ig no rance or
Avidya, he fool ishly thinks that he is sub ject to plea sure and pain.
Prox im ity will not cause the cling ing of pain and plea sure to
Brah man. When some thing in space is af fected by fire, the space it -
self can not be af fected by fire. Is ether blue be cause boys call it so?
Not even the slight est trace of ex pe ri ence of plea sure and pain can be
at trib uted to Brah man.
Sruti de clares “Two birds are liv ing to gether as friends on the
same tree i.e. body. One of them, i.e. the in di vid ual soul, eats the
taste ful fruit i.e. en joys the fruit of his ac tions: and the other i.e. the Su -
preme Soul wit nesses with out eat ing any thing, i.e. with out par tak ing
of fruit” Mun. Up. III-1-1.
Sutras 1 to 8 have es tab lished that the sub ject of dis cus sion in
the quoted por tion of the Chhandogya Upanishad Chap ter III-14 is
Brah man and not the in di vid ual soul.

Attradhikaranam: Topic 2 (Sutras 9-10)
The eater is Brahman.
```
**AÎmm MamMaJ«hUmV² &**

**Atta characharagrahanat** I.2.9 (40)

The Eater (is Brahman), because both the movable and
immovable (i.e. the whole world) is taken (as His food).

**Atta:** the Eater; **Characharagrahanat:** because the movable and
immovable (i.e. the whole universe) is taken (as His food).

A pas sage from the Kathopanishad is now taken up for dis cus -
sion. We read in Kathopanishad I.2.25 “Who then knows where He is,
to Whom the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas are (as it were) but food, and
death it self a con di ment?” This text shows by means of the words
‘food’ and ‘con di ment’ that there is some eater.
Who is this eater? Is it the fire re ferred to in as eater: “Soma in -
deed is food, and fire eater” Bri. Up. I-4-6, or is it in di vid ual soul re -
ferred to as eater “One of them eats the sweet fruit” Mun. Up. III-I-I, or
the Su preme Self?
We re ply that the eater must be the Su preme Self be cause it is
men tioned what is mov able and what is im mov able. The en tire uni -
verse is re-ab sorbed in Brah man. All things mov able and im mov able
are here to be taken as con sti tut ing the food of Brah man while Death
it self is the con di ment. The eater of the whole world, the con sumer of
all these things in their to tal ity can be Brah man alone and none else.
The Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas are men tioned as mere ex -
am ples as they are fore most of cre ated be ings and as they hold a
pre-em i nent po si tion. The words are merely il lus tra tive.
The whole uni verse sprin kled over by Death is re ferred to here
as the food. Con di ment is a thing which ren ders other things more

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 58
```

pal at able and causes other things to be eaten with great rel ish.
There fore the Death it self is con sumed, be ing a con di ment as it were,
it makes other things pal at able. There fore the Eater of the en tire
world made pal at able by Death, can mean only Brah man in His as -
pect of De stroyer. He with draws the whole uni verse within Him self at
the time of Pralaya or dis so lu tion. There fore the Su preme Self must
be taken here as the Eater.
The op po nent says: Brah man can not be an eater. The Sruti de -
clares “The other looks on with out eat ing”. We say that this has no va -
lid ity. The pas sage aims at de ny ing the fru ition of the re sults of works.
It is not meant to deny the re-ab sorp tion of the world into Brah man;
be cause it is well-es tab lished by all the Vedanta-texts that Brah man is

the cause of the cre ation, sus te nance and re-ab sorp tion of the world.
There fore the Eater can here be Brah man only.

**àH$aUmƒŸ&**

**Prakaranaccha** I.2.10 (41)

And on account of the context also the (eater is Brahman).

**Prakaranat:** from the context; **Cha:** also, and.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 9 is given.
Brah man is the sub ject of the dis cus sion. In the be gin ning
Nachiketas asks Yama, “Tell me of that which is above good and evil,
which is be yond cause and ef fect and which is other than the past and

fu ture” Katha Up. I-2-14. Yama re plies, “I will tell you in brief. It is OM”
Katha Up. I-2-15. This At man is nei ther born nor does it die” Katha
Up. I-2-18. He fi nally in cludes “of whom the Brahmana and the
Kshatriya classes are, as it were, food and Death it self a con di ment or
pickle, how can one thus know where that At man is?”
All this ob vi ously shows that Brah man is the gen eral topic. To
ad here to the gen eral topic is the proper pro ceed ing. Hence the Eater
is Brah man. Fur ther the clause “Who then knows where he is”, shows
that reali sa tion is very dif fi cult. This again points to the Su preme Self.
The force of the word ‘Cha’ (and) in the Su tra is to in di cate that
the Smriti is also to the same ef fect, as says the Gita.
“Thou art the Eater of the worlds, of all that moves and stands;
wor thier of rev er ence than the Guru’s self, there is none like Thee”.

```
Guhapravishtadhikaranam: Topic 3 (Sutras 11-12)
The dwellers in the cave of the heart are
the individual soul and Brahman.
```
**Jwhm§ à{dï>mdmË_mZm¡ {h VÔe©ZmV²Ÿ&**

**Guham pravistavatmanau hi taddarsanat** I.2. 1 1 (42)

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 2 59
```

The two who have entered into the cavity (of the heart) are
indeed the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, because it is
so seen.

**Guham:** in the cavity (of the heart) **Pravishtau:** the two who have
entered; **Atmanau:** are the two selfs (individual soul and the
Supreme Soul); **Hi:** indeed, because; **Taddarsanat:** because it is so
seen.

An other pas sage of the Kathopanishad is taken up for dis cus -
sion. In the same Kathopanishad I-3-1 we read, “Hav ing en tered the
cav ity of the heart, the two en joy the re ward of their works in the body.
Those who know Brah man call them shade and light: like wise those
house hold ers who per form the Trinachiketa sac ri fice”.
The doubt arises here whether the cou ple re ferred to are the in -
di vid ual soul and Buddhi (in tel lect).
In the pas sage un der dis cus sion, the cou ple re ferred to are the
in di vid ual soul and the Su preme Self, for these two, be ing both in tel li -
gent selfs, are of the same na ture. We see that in or di nary life also
when ever a num ber is men tioned, be ings of the same class are un -
der stood to be meant. When a bull is brought to us, we say ‘bring an -
other, look out for a sec ond’. It means an other bull, not a horse or a
man. So, if with an in tel li gent self, the in di vid ual soul, an other is said
to en ter the cav ity of the heart, it must re fer to an other of the same
class i.e. to an other in tel li gent be ing and not to the in tel lect (Buddhi)
which is in sen tient.
Sruti and Smriti speak of the Su preme Self as placed in the
cave. We read in Kathopanishad I-2-12 “The an cient who is hid den in
the cave, who dwells in the abyss”. We also find in Taittiriya
Upanishad II-1 “He who knows him hid den in the cave, in the high est
ether” and “search for the self who en tered into the cave”. A spe cial
abode for the all-per vad ing Brah man is given for the pur pose of con -
cep tion and med i ta tion. This is not con trary to rea son.
Some times the char ac ter is tics of one in a group are in di rectly
ap plied to the whole group as when we say “The men with an um -
brella” where only one has an um brella and not the whole group. Sim -
i larly here also, though it is only one who is en joy ing the fruits of
ac tions both are spo ken of as eat ing the fruits.
The word _‘pibantau’_ is in the dual num ber mean ing ‘the two drink
while as a mat ter of fact, the Jiva only drinks the fruit of his works and
not the Su preme Self. We may ex plain the pas sage by say ing that
while the in di vid ual soul drinks, the Su preme Self also is said to drink
be cause he makes the soul to drink. The in di vid ual soul is the di rect
agent, the Su preme Self is the causal agent that is to say the in di vid -
ual self di rectly drinks while the Su preme Self causes the in di vid ual
soul to drink.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 60
```

The phrases ‘shade’ and ‘light’ show the dif fer ence be tween the
In fi nite Knowl edge of the Su preme Self and the fi nite knowl edge of

the Jiva, or that the Jiva is bound down to the chain of Samsara, while

the Su preme Self is above Samsara.

We, there fore, un der stand by the ‘two en tered into the cave’, the
in di vid ual soul and the Su preme Self.
An other rea son for this in ter pre ta tion is given in the fol low ing
Su tra.

**{deofUmƒŸ&**

**Viseshanaccha** I.2.12 (43)

And on account of the distinctive qualities (of the two

**Viseshanat:** on account of distinctive qualities; **Cha:** and.

```
An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 11 is given.
This is clear also from the de scrip tion in other por tions of the
```
same scrip ture viz. Kathopanishad.
Fur ther the dis tinc tive qual i ties men tioned in the text agree only
with the in di vid ual soul and the Su preme Soul. Be cause in a sub se -
quent pas sage (I-3-3) the char ac ter is tics of the two that have en tered
the cav ity of the heart are given. They in di cate that the two are the in -
di vid ual soul and Brah man. “Know that the Self to be the char i o teer,
the body to be the char iot.” The in di vid ual soul is rep re sented as a
char i o teer driv ing on through the trans mi gra tory ex is tence and fi nal
eman ci pa tion. Fur ther it is said “He at tains the end of his jour ney, that
high est place of Vishnu” Katha Up. I-3-9. Here it is rep re sented that
the Su preme Self is the goal of the driver’s course. The two are men -
tioned here as the attainer and the goal at tained i.e. the in di vid ual soul
or Jiva and the Su preme Soul or Brah man.

In the pre ced ing pas sage (I-2-12) also it is said “The wise, who
by means of med i ta tion on his Self, re cog nises the An cient who is dif -
fi cult to be seen, who has en tered into the dark, who is hid den in the
cave of the heart, who abides in the abyss as God, he in deed leaves
joy and sor row far be hind”. Here the two are spo ken of as the
meditator and the ob ject of med i ta tion.
More over the Su preme Self is the gen eral topic. It is there fore
ob vi ous that the pas sage un der dis cus sion re fers to the in di vid ual
soul and the Su preme Self.

The person within the eye is Brahman.

**AÝVa CnnÎmo...Ÿ&**

**Antara upapatteh** I.2.13 (44)

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 2 61
```

The person within (the eye) (is Brahman) on account of (the

attributes mentioned therein) being appropriate (only to

Brahman).

**Antara:** inside (the eye), the being within the eye; **Upapatteh:** on
account of the appropriateness of (attributes).

The be ing within the eye is Brah man, be cause it is rea son able
to con strue the pas sage as ap ply ing to the Su preme Self than to any -
thing else.
The form of wor ship in an other part of Chhandogya Upanishad
(IV-15-1), tak ing the be ing within the eyes as the Su preme Self, is
taken up as the sub ject for dis cus sion.
In Chhandogya Upanishad IV-15-1 we read, “This per son that is
seen in the eye is the Self. This is Im mor tal and fear less, this is Brah -
man”. The doubt here arises whether this pas sage re fers to the re -
flected self which re sides in the eye, or to the in di vid ual soul or to the
self of some de ity which pre sides over the or gan of sight or to the Su -
preme Self.
The Su tra says that the per son in the eye is Brah man only, be -
cause the at trib utes ‘Im mor tal’, ‘fear less’, etc., men tioned here ac -
cord with the na ture of the Su preme Self only.
The at trib utes ‘be ing un touched by sin’, be ing ‘Samyadvama’
etc., are ap pli ca ble to the Su preme Self only. The at trib utes of be ing
‘Vamani’ or the leader of all and ‘Bhamani’, the All-ef ful gent, ap plied
to the per son in the eye are ap pro pri ate in the case of Brah man also.
There fore, on ac count of agree ment, the per son within the eye
is the Su preme Self or Brah man only.

**ñWmZm{Xì`nXoemƒŸ&**

**Sthanadivyapadesaccha** I.2.14 (46)

And on account of the statement of place and so on.

**Sthanadi:** the place and the rest; **Vyapadesat:** on account of the
statement; **Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 13 is given.
In other Srutis lo ca tion etc., i.e., abode, name and form are at -
trib uted to Brah man Him self to fa cil i tate med i ta tion. But how can the
all-per vad ing Brah man be in a lim ited space like the eye? Def i nite
abode like the cav ity of the heart, the eye, the earth, disc of the sun
etc., is given to the all-per vad ing Brah man for the pur pose of med i ta -
tion (Upasana), just as Saligrama is pre scribed for med i ta tion on
Vishnu. This is not con trary to rea son.
The phrase ‘and so on’ which forms part of the Su tra shows that
not only abode is as signed to Brah man but also such things as name
and form not ap pro pri ate to Brah man which is de void of name and
form, are as cribed to It for the sake of med i ta tion, as Brah man with out

**Sukhavisishtabhidhanadeva cha** I.2.15 (46)

And on account of the passage referring to that which is
distinguished by bliss (i.e. Brahman).

**Sukha:** bliss; **Visishta:** qualified by; **Abhidhanat:** because of the
description; **Eva:** alone; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 13 is con tin ued.
Be cause the text re fers to the Su preme Self only and not to Jiva
who is mis er a ble.
The same Brah man which is spo ken of as char ac ter ised by bliss
in the be gin ning of the chap ter in the clauses “Breath is Brah man,”
“ _Ka_ is Brah man” “ _Kha_ is Brah man” we must sup pose It to be re ferred
to in the pres ent pas sage also, as it is proper to stick to the sub ject
mat ter un der dis cus sion.
The fires taught to Upakosala about Brah man “Breath is Brah -
man, bliss is Brah man, the ether is Brah man” Chh. Up. IV-10-5. This
same Brah man is fur ther elu ci dated by his teacher as “the be ing in
the eye”.
On hear ing the speech of the fires viz., “Breath is Brah man, _Ka_
is Brah man, _Kha_ is Brah man”, Upakosala says “I un der stand that
breath is Brah man, but I do not un der stand that _Ka_ or _Kha_ is Brah -
man”. There fore the fires re ply “What is _Ka_ is _Kha_. What is _Kha_ is _Ka_ ”.
The word _Ka_ in or di nary lan guage de notes sen sual plea sure. If
the word _Kha_ were not used to qual ify the sense of _Ka_ one would think
that or di nary worldly plea sure was meant. But as the two words _Ka_
and _Kha_ oc cur to gether and qual ify each other, they in di cate Brah -
man whose Self is Bliss. There fore the ref er ence is to Su preme Bliss
and such a de scrip tion can ap ply only to Brah man.
If the word Brah man in the clause “ _Ka_ is Brah man” were not
added and if the sen tence would run “ _Ka_ , _Kha_ is Brah man”, the word
_Ka_ would be only an ad jec tive and thus plea sure be ing a mere qual ity
can not be a sub ject of med i ta tion. To pre vent this, both words _Ka_ as
well as _Kha_ are joined with the word Brah man. “ _Ka_ is Brah man. _Kha_ is
Brah man”. Qual i ties as well as per sons hav ing those qual i ties could
be ob jects of med i ta tion.

**Sruto** : heard; **Upanishatka:** Upanishads; **Gati:** way; **Abhidhanat:**

because of the statement; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 13 is con tin ued.
The per son in the eye is the Su preme Self for the fol low ing rea -
son also. From Sruti we know of the way of the knower of Brah man.

He trav els af ter death through the Devayana path or the path of the

Gods. That way is de scribed in Prasna Up. 1-10. “Those who have
sought the Self by pen ance, ab sti nence, faith and knowl edge at tain

the Sun by the North ern Path or the path of Devayana. From thence
they do not re turn. This is the im mor tal abode, free from fear, and the

high est.”
The knower of the “per son in the eye” also goes by this path af -

ter death. From this de scrip tion of the way which is known to be the
way of him who knows Brah man it is quite clear that the per son within

the eye is Brah man.
The fol low ing Su tra shows that it is not pos si ble for the above
text to mean ei ther the re flected Self or the Jiva or the de ity in the Sun.

**AZdpñWVoagå^dmƒ ZoVa...Ÿ&**

**Anavasthiterasambhavaccha netarah** I.2.17 (48)

(The person within the eye is the Supreme Self) and not any
other (i.e. the individual soul etc.) as these do not exist always;

person in the being ascribed to any of these).

**Anavasthiteh:** not existing always; **Asambhavat:** on account of the

impossibility; **Cha:** and; **Na:** not; **Itarah:** any other.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 13 is con tin ued.
The re flected self does not per ma nently abide in the eye. When
some per son co mes near the eye the re flec tion of that per son is seen

in the eye. When he moves away the re flec tion dis ap pears.
Surely you do not pro pose to have some one near the eye at the

time of med i ta tion so that you may med i tate on the im age in the eye.
Such a fleet ing im age can not be the ob ject of med i ta tion. The in di vid -

ual soul is not meant by the pas sage, be cause he is sub ject to ig no -
rance, de sire and ac tion, he has no per fec tion. Hence he can not be

the ob ject of med i ta tion. The qual i ties like im mor tal ity, fear less ness,

im ma nence, eter nity, per fec tion etc., can not be ap pro pri ately at trib -
uted to the re flected self or the in di vid ual soul or the de ity in the sun.

There fore no other self save the Su preme Self is here spo ken of as
the per son in the eye. The per son in the eye (Akshi Purusha) must be

viewed as the Su preme Self only.

**Antaryamyadhidaivadishu taddharmavyapadesat** I.2.18 (49)
The internal ruler over the gods and so on (is Brahman)
because the attributes of that (Brahman) are mentioned.

**Antaryami:** the ruler within; **Adhidaivadishu:** in the gods, etc.; **Tat:**
His; **Dharma:** attributes; **Vyapadesat:** because of the statement.

A pas sage from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is now taken up
for dis cus sion. In Bri. Up. III-7-1 we read “He who within rules this
world and the other world and all be ings” and later on “He who dwells
in the earth and within the earth, whom the earth does not know,
whose body the earth is, who rules the earth from within, he is thy
Self, the ruler within, the im mor tal” etc., III-7-3.
Here a doubt arises whether the In ner Ruler (Antaryamin) de -
notes the in di vid ual soul or some Yogin en dowed with ex traor di nary
pow ers such as for in stance, the power of mak ing his body sub tle or
the pre sid ing de ity or Pradhana or Brah man (the High est Self).

The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: Some god pre sid ing
over the earth and so on must be the Antaryamin. He only is ca pa ble
of rul ing the earth as he is en dowed with the or gans of ac tion. Rul er -
ship can rightly be as cribed to him only. Or else the ruler may be some
Yogin who is able to en ter within all things on ac count of his ex traor di -
nary Yogic pow ers. Cer tainly the Su preme Self can not be meant as
He does not pos sess the or gans of ac tions which are needed for rul -
ing.
We give the fol low ing re ply. The in ter nal Ruler must be Brah man
or the Su preme Self. Why so? Be cause His qual i ties are men tioned in
the pas sage un der dis cus sion. Brah man is the cause of all cre ated
things. The uni ver sal rul er ship is an ap pro pri ate at trib ute of the Su -
preme Self only. Om nip o tence, Self hood, Im mor tal ity, etc., can be as -
cribed to Brah man only.

The pas sage “He whom the earth does not know,” shows that
the In ner Ruler is not known by the earth-de ity. There fore it is ob vi ous
that the In ner Ruler is dif fer ent from that de ity. The at trib utes ‘un seen’,
‘un heard’, also re fer to the Su preme Self only Which is de void of
shape and other sen si ble qual i ties.
He is also de scribed in the sec tion as be ing all-per vad ing, as He
is in side and the Ruler within of ev ery thing viz., the earth, the sun, wa -
ter, fire, sky, the ether, the senses, etc. This also can be true only of
the High est Self or Brah man. For all these rea sons, the In ner Ruler is
no other but the Su preme Self or Brah man.

**Na:** neither; **Cha:** also, and; **Smartam** : that which is taught in
(Sankhya) Smriti; **Ataddharmabhilapat:** because qualities contrary
to its nature are mentioned.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 18 is given.
The word Antaryamin (In ner Ruler) can not re late to Pradhana
as it has not got Chaitanya (sentiency) and can not be called At man.
The Pradhana is not this ‘In ter nal Ruler’ as the at trib utes “He is
the im mor tal, un seen Seer, un heard Hearer” etc., “There is no other
seer but He, there is no other thinker but He, there is no other Knower
but He. This is the Self, the Ruler within, the Im mor tal. Ev ery thing else
is of evil” (Bri. Up. III-7-23), can not be as cribed to the non-in tel li gent
blind Pradhana.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: Well then, if the term
‘In ter nal Ruler’ can not de note the Pradhana as it is nei ther a Self nor
seer it can cer tainly de note the in di vid ual soul or Jiva who is in tel li gent
and there fore sees, hears, thinks and knows, who is in ter nal and
there fore of the na ture of Self. Fur ther the in di vid ual soul is ca pa ble of
rul ing over the or gans, as he is the enjoyer. There fore the in ter nal
ruler is the in di vid ual soul or Jiva.
The fol low ing Su tra gives a suit able an swer to this.

And the individual soul (is not the Internal Ruler) for both also

of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad) speak of it as different

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 18 is con tin ued. The word ‘not’
is to be sup plied from the pre ced ing Su tra.
The fol low ers of both Sakhas speak in their texts of the in di vid -
ual soul as dif fer ent from the in ter nal ruler. The Kanvas read “He who
dwells in Knowl edge— _Yo vijnane tishthan_ ” Bri. Up. III-7-22. Here
‘knowl edge’ stands for the in di vid ual soul. The Madhyandinas read
“He who dwells in the Self— _ya atmani tishthan_ ”. Here ‘Self’ stands for

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 66

the in di vid ual soul. In ei ther read ing the in di vid ual soul is spo ken of as
dif fer ent from the ‘In ter nal Ruler’, for the In ter nal Ruler is the Ruler of
the in di vid ual soul also.
The dif fer ence be tween the Jiva and Brah man is one of Upadhi
(lim i ta tion). The dif fer ence be tween the In ter nal Ruler and the in di vid -
ual soul is merely the prod uct of ig no rance or Avidya. It has its rea son

ig no rance. The dif fer ence is not ab so lutely true. Be cause the Self
within is one only; two in ter nal Selfs are not pos si ble. But on ac count
of lim it ing ad juncts the one Self is prac ti cally treated as if it were two,
just as we make a dis tinc tion be tween the ether of the jar and the uni -
ver sal ether.
The scrip tural text “where there is du al ity, as it were, there one
sees an other” in ti mates that the world ex ists only in the sphere of ig -
no rance, while the sub se quent text “But when the Self only is all this
how should one see an other” de clares that the world dis ap pears in
the sphere of true knowl edge.

Adrisyatvadhikaranam: Topic 6 (Sutras 21-23)
That which cannot be seen is Brahman.
```
**AÑí`Ëdm{XJwUH$mo Y_m}ºo$Ÿ...Ÿ&**

**Adrisyatvadigunako dharmokteh** I.2.21 (52)
The possessor of qualities like indivisibility etc., (is Brahman)
on account of the declaration of Its attributes.

**Adrisyatva:** invisibility; **Adi:** and the rest, beginning with; **Gunakah:**
one who possesses the quality ( **Adrisyatvadigunakah:** possessor of
qualities like invisibility); **Dharmokteh:** because of the mention of
qualities.

Some ex pres sions from the Mundaka Upanishad are now taken
up as the sub ject for dis cus sion.
We read in the Mundaka Upanishad (I-1-5 & 6) “The higher
knowl edge is this by which the in de struc ti ble is known or real ised.
That which can not be seen nor seized, which is with out or i gin and
qual i ties, with out hands and feet, the eter nal, all-per vad ing, om ni -
pres ent, in fin i tes i mal, that which is im per ish able, that it is which the
wise con sider as the source of all be ings.”
Here the doubt arises whether the source of all be ings which is
spo ken of as char ac ter ised by in vis i bil ity etc., is Pradhana, or the in di -
vid ual soul, or the Su preme Self or the High est Lord.
That which here is spo ken of as the source of all be ings
(Bhutayoni) char ac ter ised by such at trib utes as in vis i bil ity and so on,
can be the Su preme Self or Brah man only, noth ing else, be cause
qual i ties like “He is all-know ing (Sarvajna), all-per ceiv ing (Sarvavit)

which is non-in tel li gent. Cer tainly it can not re fer to the Jiva or the em -
bod ied soul as he is nar rowed by his lim it ing con di tions. The sec tion
also, in which these pas sages oc cur re lates to the High est Knowl -
edge or Para Vidya. There fore it must re fer to Brah man and not to
Pradhana or Jiva.

**{deofU^oXì`nXoemä`m§ M ZoVam¡Ÿ&**

**Viseshanabhedavyapadesabhyam cha netarau** I.2.22 (53)
The other two (viz. the individual soul and the Pradhana) are
not (the source of all beings) for distinctive attributes and
differences are stated.

**Viseshanabhedavyapadesabhyam:** on account of the mention of
distinctive attributes and differences; **Cha:** and; **Na:** not; **Itarau:** the
other two.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 21 is given.
The source of all be ings is Brah man or the Su preme Self but not
ei ther of the two oth ers viz., the in di vid ual soul for the fol low ing rea -
son also.
We read in the Mundaka Upanishad II.1, 2 “That the heav enly
per son is with out a body. He is both with out and within, is birthless,
with out breath, and with out mind, pure, higher than the high, Im per -
ish able.” The dis tinc tive at trib utes men tioned here such as “be ing of a
heav enly na ture” (Divya), ‘Birthless’, ‘Pure’, etc., can in no way be -
long to the in di vid ual soul who er ro ne ously re gards him self to be lim -
ited by name and form as pre sented by Avidya or ig no rance and
er ro ne ously con sid ers him self lim ited, im pure, cor po real, etc. There -
fore the pas sage ob vi ously re fers to the Su preme Self or Brah man
who is the sub ject of all the Upanishads.
“Higher than the high, Im per ish able (Pradhana)” in ti mates that
the source of all be ings spo ken of in the last Su tra is not the Pradhana
but some thing dif fer ent from it. Here the term im per ish able means the
Avyaktam or Avyakrita (the unmanifested or the un dif fer en ti ated)
which rep re sents the po ten ti al ity or the seed of all names and forms,
con tains the sub tle parts of the ma te rial el e ments and abides in the
Lord. As it is no ef fect of any thing, it is high when com pared to all ef -
fects. In tel lect, mind, ego ism, the Tanmatras, the or gans are all born
from it. “ _Aksharat paratah parah_ —Higher than the high, Im per ish -
able”, which ex presses a dif fer ence clearly in di cates that the Su -
preme Self or Brah man is meant here. Be yond Pradhana or
Avyaktam is Para Brah man. It is a set tled con clu sion there fore that
the source of all be ings must mean the high est Self or Brah man only.
A fur ther ar gu ment in fa vour of the same con clu sion is given in
the fol low ing Su tra.

**énmonÝ`mgmƒŸ&**

**Rupopanyasaccha** I-2-23 (54)

And on account of its form being mentioned (the passage
under discussion refers to Brahman).

**Rupa:** form; **Upanyasat:** because of the mention; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 21 is con tin ued.
Fur ther His form is de scribed in the Mundaka Upanishad II-1-4
“Fire is His head, His eyes the sun and the moon, the quar ters His
ears, His speech the Vedas, the wind His breath, His heart the uni -
verse; from His feet came the earth, He is in deed the in ner Self of all
be ings.”
This state ment of form can re fer only to the Su preme Lord or
Brah man. Such a de scrip tion is ap pro pri ate only in the case of Brah -
man, be cause the Jiva is of lim ited power and be cause Pradhana
(mat ter) can not be the Soul or in ner Self of liv ing be ings.
As the “source of all be ings” forms the gen eral topic, the whole
pas sage from “From Him is born breath” upto “He is the in ner Self of
all be ings” re fers to that same source.
“The Per son in deed is all this, sac ri fice, knowl edge etc.” Mun.
Up. II-1-10, in ti mates that the source of all be ings re ferred to in the
pas sage un der dis cus sion is none other than the Su preme Self or
Brah man, for He is the in ner Self of all be ings.

Vaisvanaradhikaranam: Topic 7 (Sutras 24-32)
Vaisvanara is Brahman.
```
**d¡ídmZa... gmYmaUeãX{deofmV² &**

**Vaisvanarah sadharanasabdaviseshat** I.2.24 (55)
Vaisvanara (is Brahman) on account of the distinction
qualifying the common terms (“Vaisvanara” and “Self”).

**Vaisvanarah:** Vaisvanara; **Sadharana sabda:** common word;
**Viseshat:** because of the distinction.

This Su tra proves that the word “Vaisvanara” used in Sruti for
wor ship in di cates Brah man.

We read in Chh. Up. V.18.1-2 “He who med i tates on the
Vaisvanara Self, ex tend ing from heaven to earth as iden ti cal with his
own Self, eats food in all be ings, in all selfs. Of that Vaisvanara Self
Sutejas (heaven) is the head, the sun the eye, the feet the earth, the
mouth the Ahavaniya fire.”
Here the doubt arises whether by the term “Vaisvanara” we
have to un der stand the gas tric fire or the el e men tal fire, or the god
pre sid ing over the el e men tal fire, or the in di vid ual soul or the Su -
preme Self (Brah man).

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 2 69
```

The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says that Vaisvanara is the
gas tric fire be cause it is said in Bri. Up. V-9 “Agni Vaisvanara is the fire
within man by which the food that is eaten is di gested. Or it may de -
note fire in gen eral or the de ity which pre sides over the el e men tal fire
or the in di vid ual soul who be ing an enjoyer is in close vi cin ity to
Vaisvanara fire.”
The Siddhantin says, here that the Su preme Self or Brah man
only is re ferred to on ac count of the qual i fy ing ad juncts to these
words. The ad juncts are “Heaven is the head of this Vaisvanara Self,
the Sun its eyes, etc.” This is pos si ble only in the case of the Su preme
Self.
Fur ther in the pas sage “He eats food in all worlds, in all be ings,
in all selfs.” This is pos si ble only if we take the term Vaisvanara to de -
note the High est Self.
The fruit of med i ta tion on this Vaisvanara Self is the at tain ment
of all de sires and de struc tion of all sins (Chh. Up. V.24.3). This can
only be true if the Su preme Self is meant. More over the chap ter be -
gins with the en quiry “What is our Self? What is Brah man?” The
words ‘Self’ and ‘Brah man’ are marks of Brah man and in di cate the
Su preme Self only. The word ‘Brah man’ is used in its pri mary sense.
There fore it is proper to think that the whole chap ter treats of Brah -
man only. More over, ety mo logi cally also the word Vaisvanara means
Brah man; be cause it is com posed of two words “Visva” mean ing “all”
and “Nara” mean ing “men” namely “He who con tains all men within
him self.” Such a be ing is Brah man only.
It is a set tled con clu sion, there fore, that only Brah man can be
meant by the term “Vaisvanara”.

**ñ_`©_mU_Zw_mZ§ ñ`m{X{VŸ&**

**Smaryamanamanumanam syaditi** I.2.25 (56)
Because that (cosmic form of the Supreme Lord) which is
described in the Smriti is an indicatory mark or inference (from
which we infer the meaning of this Sruti text under
discussion).

**Smaryamanam:** mentioned in the Smriti; **Anumanam:** indicatory
mark, inference; **Syat:** may be; **Iti:** because thus.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is given. The word ‘Iti’ de -
notes a rea son. It points to a cor rob o ra tive state ment which ex -
presses the same thing as the Sruti. The Smritis in ter pret the
pas sages of the Sruti. There fore where a doubt arises as to the sig nif -
i cance of a pas sage in the Sruti, the Smriti may be con sulted in or der
to get more light on the sub ject mat ter. The Smriti gives a de scrip tion
of the cos mic form of the High est Lord as “He whose mouth is fire,
whose head is heaven, whose na vel the ether, whose eyes the sun,
whose ears the re gions, rev er ence to Him, whose body is the world.”

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 70
```

This is in agree ment with the de scrip tion in the text un der dis cus sion.
The same Lord who is spo ken of in the Sruti is de scribed in the Smriti
also.
In the Bhagavad Gita XV-14 the word Vaisvanara is ex pressly
ap plied to the Lord—“I hav ing be come the fire of life, take pos ses sion
of the bod ies of breath ing be ings and united with the life-breaths, I di -
gest the four kinds of food.” Here a truth about the Lord is de clared in
a Smriti pas sage and from it we may in fer that the Vaisvanara Vidya
taught in the Chhandogya Upanishad also re fers to this mys tery of the
Lord. Hence Vaisvanara is the High est Lord. There fore it is a set tled
con clu sion that the Su preme Lord is re ferred to in the text.
In the fol low ing Su tra the au thor re moves the doubt that the
Vaisvanara may de note the gas tric fire.

**Sabdadibhyo’ntahpratisthanaccha neti chet na tatha
drishtyupadesat asambhavat purushamapi
chainamadhiyate** I.2.26 (57)

If it be said that (Vaisvanara is) not (Brahman) or the Highest
Lord on account of the term (viz., Vaisvanara which has a
different settled meaning viz., gastric fire) etc., and on account
of his abiding within (which is a characteristic of the gastric
fire) (we say) no, because there is the instruction to conceive
(Brahman) as such (as the gastric fire, because it is impossible
for the gastric fire to have the heaven etc., for its head and
other limbs) and also because they (the Vajasaneyins) describe
him (viz. the Vaisvanara) as man (which term cannot apply to
the gastric fire).

**Sabdadibhyah:** on account of the word; **Antah:** within;
**Pratishthanat:** because of abiding; **Cha:** and; **Na:** not; **Iti chet:** if it be
said; **Na:** not so; **Tatha:** thus, as such; **Drishtyupadesat:** on account
of the instructions to conceive it; **Asambhavat:** because of
impossibility; **Purusham:** as person; **Api:** also; **Cha:** and; **Evam:**
him; **Adhiyate:** (they) describe.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is con tin ued.
The Purvapakshin raises the fol low ing ob jec tion. The or di nary
mean ing of “Vaisvanara” is fire. More over scrip ture speaks of the
Vaisvanara as abid ing within. “He knows him abid ing within man” Sat.
Br. 10-6-1-11 which ap plies to the gas tric fire only. There fore the gas -
tric fire alone and not Brah man is re ferred to in the text un der dis cus -
sion.
This Su tra re futes this ob jec tion. The Siddhantin gives the fol -
low ing re ply. The Sruti here teaches the wor ship of Brah man in the

```

gas tric fire by way of med i ta tion (Upasana) anal o gously to such pas -
sages as “Let a man med i tate on the mind as Brah man” Chh. Up.
III-18-1.
More over the gas tric fire can not have heaven for its head, and
so on. Fur ther the Vajasaneyins con sider Vaisvanara as a man
(Purusha). “This Agni Vaisvanara is a man” Sat. Br. 10.6.1-11.
There fore “Vaisvanara” here re fers to Brah man only. In the fol -
low ing Su tra the au thor sets aside the view that Vaisvanara of this
pas sage means the Devata called Agni or the el e men tal fire.

**AV Ed Z XodVm ^yV§ MŸ&**

**Ata eva na devata bhutam cha** I.2.27 (58)
For the same reasons (the Vaisvanara) cannot be the deity (fire)
or the element (fire).

**Ata eva** : for the same reasons; **Na:** (is) not; **Devata:** the presiding
deity of fire; **Bhutam:** the element of fire; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is con tin ued.
The Purvapakshin says: the pre sid ing de ity of fire is a mighty
be ing. He is en dowed with great lord li ness and power. There fore
heaven, etc., may very ap pro pri ately be its head and other mem bers.
There fore the pas sage may very well ap ply to him.
For the same rea sons stated in Su tra 26 Vaisvanara is nei ther
the di vin ity of fire nor the el e ment of fire. The el e men tal fire is mere
heat and light. The heaven and so on can not prop erly be as cribed as
its head and so on, be cause an ef fect can not be the Self of an other ef -
fect. Again the heav enly world can not be as cribed as head, etc., to
the god of fire, be cause it is not the Su preme Cause but a mere ef fect
and its power or glory de pends on the Su preme Lord. To them the
word “At man” could not ap pro pri ately be ap pli ca ble at all.

**gmjmXß`{damoY§ O¡{_{Z...**

**Sakshadapyavirodham Jaiminih** I.2.28 (59)

Jaimini (declares that there is) no contradiction even (if by
Vaisvanara) (Brahman is) directly (taken as the object of
worship).

**Sakshat:** directly; **Api:** also, even; **Avirodham:** no objection, no
contradiction; **Jaiminih:** (so says) Jaimini.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is con tin ued.
Jaimini says that it is not nec es sary to state that what is meant
by Vaisvanara is fire as a sym bol of God and that the view that it
means Brah man di rectly and in a pri mary sense is quite con sis tent
and ap pro pri ate. The very word ‘Vaisvanara’ means the to tal ity of life
and ap plies to Brah man as he is the Soul of all (Sarvatmatvat).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 72
```

This Su tra de clares that ‘Vaisvanara’ can be taken di rectly to
mean Brah man as an ob ject of med i ta tion, be cause Vaisvanara also
means the uni ver sal man i.e., the all-per vad ing Brah man Him self. As
the word Vaisvanara lit er ally means “He to whom be long all men” or
“who is the leader (Nara) of all (Visva)” so the word Vaisvanara de -
notes ety mo logi cally the Su preme Brah man.

**A{^ì`ºo$[aË`mí_aÏ`...Ÿ&**

**Abhivyakterityasmarathyah** I.2.29 (60)

On account of the manifestation, so says Aasmarathya.

**Abhivyakteh:** because of manifestation; Iti: thus, so;
**Aasmarathyah:** (says) Asmarathya.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is con tin ued.
In the Chhandogya Upanishad un der dis cus sion Vaisvanara is
de scribed as hav ing the size of a span. How can the In fi nite Brah man
be lim ited by the mea sure of a Pradesa or a span? To this ob jec tion
the au thor gives his an swer in the fol low ing Su tra.
The sage Aasmarathya says that for the ben e fit of the wor ship -
per the In fi nite Brah man man i fests Him self in the fi nite in di vid u ally be -
ing local ised in lim ited places such as the body or the heart of the
hu man be ing. There fore there is no in con gru ity in us ing the word
“Vaisvanara” (even stand ing for the gas tric fire) to sig nify Brah man.
Even though Brah man is all-per vad ing, yet He spe cially man i fests
Him self as ex tend ing from heaven to earth or in the heart for the sake
of His dev o tees.
Asmarathya says that the In fi nite is real ised through His grace
in the lim ited space of men tal im age in the mind or a phys i cal im age
with out. The dev o tees who med i tate on Brah man in their heart as
hav ing the size of a span, see Him of that size, be cause He man i fests
Him self to them in that form.
This is the opin ion of Aasmarathya.
Hence, ac cord ing to the opin ion of the teacher Aasmarathya the
scrip tural text which speaks of Him who is mea sured by a span may
re fer to the Su preme Self or the High est Lord.

**AZwñ_¥Vo~m©X[a...Ÿ&**

**Anusmriterbadarih** I.2.30 (61)

For the sake of meditation or constant remembrance—so says
the sage Badari.

**Anusmriteh:** for the sake of meditation or constant remembrance;
**Baadarih:** (so says) the sage Baadari.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is con tin ued.
The sage Baadari is of opin ion that this mea sure of a span is a
men tal de vice to fa cil i tate med i ta tion.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 2 73
```

He says that the size of the thumb re fers to a men tal im age and
not to the ac tual size.
The Su preme Lord may be called ‘mea sured by a span’ be -
cause He is re mem bered or med i tated, by means of the mind, which
is seated in the heart which is mea sured by a span. The size of the
heart is that of a span. As Brah man is med i tated as abid ing in the lo -
tus of the heart, the as pi rant in vol un tarily as so ci ates him with the size
of a span. This men tal as so ci a tion or Anusmriti is the cause why
Brah man is called Pradesamatra, the mea sure of a span.
There fore Vaisvanara may well stand for Brah man.

**gånÎmo[a{V O¡{_{ZñVWm {h Xe©`{VŸ&**

**Sampatteriti jaiministatha hi darsayati** I.2.31 (62)

Because of imaginary identity the Supreme Lord may be called
Pradesamatra (span long). So says Jaimini because so (the
Sruti) declares.

**Sampatteh:** because of imaginary identity; **Iti:** thus, so; **Jaimini:**
(says) Jaimini; **Tatha:** in this way; **Hi:** because; **Darsayati:** (the Sruti)
declares.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is con tin ued.
Jaimini says that the de scrip tion re fers to a state of reali sa tion of
form be tween the crown of the head and the chin in your body. The
cos mic be ing is wor shipped through the iden ti fi ca tion of dif fer ent
parts of His with the dif fer ent parts of the wor ship per’s body from the
top of head to the chin. The head of the meditator or wor ship per is
heaven, the eyes the sun and the moon, and so on. In this med i ta tion
the cos mic be ing is lim ited to the size of a span, the dis tance from the
crown of the head to the chin. Hence Jaimini says that the High est
Lord in the pas sage un der dis cus sion is con sid ered as of the size of a
span.
The Sruti also de clares “The teacher said, point ing to his own
head. ‘This is the High est Vaisvanara’ i.e. the head of the
Vaisvanara”—Vajasaneyi Brahmana.

**Am_ZpÝV M¡Z_pñ_Z² &**

**Amananti chainamasmin** I.2.32 (63)

Moreover they (the Jabalas) teach that this (Supreme Lord is to
be meditated upon) in this (the space between the head and
the chin).

**Amananti:** (they) speak, teach, recite, declare; **Cha:** moreover, also,
and; **Enam:** this; **Asmin:** in this.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is con cluded.
More over the Jabalas speak in their text of the Su preme Lord in
the in ter me di ate space be tween the top of the head and the chin.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 74
```

Jabala Sruti also says so. It says that He is to be real ised
Avimukta (full lib er a tion) be tween Varana (sin preventor) and Nasi
(sin de stroyer).
Jabala Upanishad says “What is the place? The place where
the eye-brows and the nose join. That is the join ing place of the heav -
enly world rep re sented by the up per part of the head and of the other
i.e. the earthly world rep re sented by the chin.”
Sutras 27 to 32 de clare that the ref er ence to the Su preme Lord
by the term “Pradesamatra as ex tend ing from heaven to the earth or
as mea sured by a span” is quite ap pro pri ate.
By all this it is proved that Vaisvanara is the Su preme Lord.

**SYNOPSIS**
Some other pas sages pre scribed for med i ta tion in dif fer ent
Srutis, not al ready dis cussed in Sec tion-2 are now taken up for dis -
cus sion to prove that they all in di cate the same In fi nite,
Satchidananda, all-per vad ing, eter nal, Im mor tal Brah man.
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-7) proves that that within which the
heaven, the earth etc., are wo ven (Mun. Up. II-2-5) is Brah man.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Sutras 8-9) shows that the Bhuma re ferred to in
Chh. Up. VII-23 is Brah man.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 10-12) teaches that the Akshara (the Im -
per ish able one) of Bri. Up. III-8-8 in which the ether is wo ven is Brah -
man.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Su tra 13) de cides that the High est Per son who
is to be med i tated upon with the syl la ble OM ac cord ing to Prasna Up.
V-5 is not the lower but the higher Brah man.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 14-21) shows that the small ether
(Daharakasa) within the lo tus of the heart men tioned in Chh. Up.
VIII-1 is Brah man.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 22-23) proves that he af ter whom ev ery -
thing shines, by whose light all this is lighted—Katha Up. II-2-15—is
not some ma te rial lu mi nous body, but Brah man it self.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 24-25) de cides that the per son of the
size of a thumb men tioned in Katha Up. II-1-12 is not the in di vid ual
soul but Brah man.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Sutras 26-33) The next two Adhikaranas are
of the na ture of a di gres sion. They raise a side is sue and de cide that
de i ties are equally en ti tled to prac tise Brahma Vidya as pre scribed in
the Vedas. Sutras 29 and 30 es tab lish the con clu sion that the Vedas
are eter nal.
_Adhikarana IX:_ (Sutras 34-38) ex plains that Sudras are al to -
gether not en ti tled for Brahma Vidya.
_Adhikarana X:_ (Su tra 39) proves that the Prana in which ev ery -
thing trem bles ac cord ing to Katha Up. II-3-2 is Brah man.
_Adhikarana XI:_ (Su tra 40) proves that the ‘light’ (Jyoti) men -
tioned in Chh. Up. VIII-12-3 is the High est Brah man.
_Adhikarana XII:_ (Su tra 41) de cides that the ether which re veals
names and forms (Chh. Up. VIII-14) is not the el e men tal ether but
Brah man.
_Adhikarana XIII:_ (Sutras 42-43) teaches that the
Vijnanamaya—he who con sists of knowl edge of Bri. Up. IV-3-7 is not
the in di vid ual soul but Brah man.

**Dyubhvadyayatanam svasabdat** I.3.1 (64)

The abode of heaven, earth, etc., (is Brahman) on account of

the term, ‘own’ i.e., ‘Self’.

**Dyu:** heaven; **Bhu:** earth; **Adi:** and the rest; **Ayatanam:** abode; **Sva:**

own; **Sabdat:** from the word ( **Sva sabdat:** on account of the word

‘Self’).

An ex pres sion from the Mundaka Upanishad is taken up for dis -
cus sion.
Para Brah man is the ba sis or rest ing place of heaven, earth etc.,
as the term At man in dic a tive of Him is found in the pas sage. We read
in Mundaka Upanishad II-2-5 “He in whom the heaven, the earth, and
the sky are wo ven, as also the mind with all the senses, know Him
alone as the Self, and leave off other talk! He is the bridge of im mor tal -
ity.”
Here the doubt arises whether the abode is the Su preme Brah -
man or some thing else.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent holds that the abode is
some thing else on ac count of the ex pres sion “He is the bridge of im -
mor tal ity”. He says: it is known from daily ex pe ri ence that a bridge
takes one to some fur ther bank. It is im pos si ble to as sume some thing
be yond the Su preme Brah man, be cause the Srutis de clare, “Brah -
man is end less with out a shore” Bri. Up. II-4-12. As the Pradhana is
the gen eral cause, it may be called the gen eral abode. Or the
Sutratman may be the abode. The Srutis say “Air is that thread, O
Gautama! By air as by a thread O Gautama! this world and the other
world and all be ings are strung to gether” Bri. Up. III-7-2. So the air
sup ports all things. Or else the Jiva may be the abode with ref er ence
to the ob jects of en joy ment as he is the enjoyer.
He who is spo ken of as the abode, in whom the earth, heaven
etc., are wo ven is Brah man only, on ac count of the term ‘Own’ or ‘Self’
which is ap pro pri ate only if Brah man is re ferred to in the text and not
Pradhana or Sutratman. (We meet with the word ‘Self’ in the pas -
sage—“Know him alone as the Self”).
Brah man is spo ken of in the Sruti as the gen eral abode by its
own terms i.e. by terms prop erly des ig nat ing Brah man as, for in -
stance, “All these crea tures, my dear, have their root in the be ing,
their abode in the be ing, their rest in the be ing” (Chh. Up. VI-8-4).
In the texts pre ced ing and fol low ing this one, i.e. in Mun. Up.
II-1-10 and II-2-11 Brah man is spo ken of. There fore it is only proper to
in fer that Brah man only is re ferred to in the in ter ven ing texts which is

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 78
```

un der dis cus sion. In the texts cited above men tion is made of an
abode and that which abides. In Mundaka Upanishad II-2-11 we read:
“Brah man in deed is all this.” From this a doubt may arise that Brah -
man is of a man i fold var ie gated na ture, just as in the case of a tree
con sist ing of leaves, branches, stem, root etc. In or der to re move this
doubt the text de clares in the pas sage un der dis cus sion “Know Him
alone as the Self” i.e. know the Self alone and not that which is merely
a prod uct of Avidya (ig no rance) and is false or il lu sory. An other scrip -
tural text re proves the man who thinks that this world is real. “From
death to death goes he who be holds any dif fer ence here” (Katha Up.
II-4-11).
The state ment “All is Brah man” aims at dis solv ing the wrong
con cep tion of the re al ity of the world. It does not in ti mate that Brah -
man is of man i fold, var ie gated na ture. The ho mo ge neous na ture of
Brah man is clearly stated in the Srutis. “As a mass of salt has nei ther
in side nor out side, but is al to gether a mass of taste, thus in deed has
that Self (Brah man) nei ther in side nor out side, but is al to gether a
mass of knowl edge” (Bri. Up. IV-5-13). For all these rea sons the
abode of heaven, earth etc., is the Su preme Brah man.
The word Setu (bridge) in the words ‘ _Amritasyaisa Setuh_ ’ (He is
the bridge of im mor tal ity) merely re fers to His be ing the ba sis of ev ery
cre ated ob ject and the means of im mor tal ity. The word ‘bridge’ is
meant to in ti mate only that which is called a bridge that sup ports, not
that it has a fur ther bank. You should not think that the bridge meant is
like an or di nary bridge made of wood or stone. Be cause the word
‘Setu’ is de rived from the root ‘Si’ which means to bind. The word con -
veys the idea of hold ing to gether or sup port ing.

**Muktopasripyavyapadesat** I.3.2 (65)

Because of the declaration (in the scriptures) that that is to be
attained by the liberated.

**Mukta upasripya:** to be attained by the liberated; **Vyapadesat:**
because of declaration.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra I is given.
The above word “Dyubhvadyayatanam” re fers to Para Brah -
man, also be cause He is de scribed as at tained by the eman ci pated
soul.
A fur ther rea son is given to in ti mate that Brah man is meant in
the pas sage un der dis cus sion. Brah man is the goal of the eman ci -
pated. That Brah man is that which is to be re sorted to by the lib er ated
is known from other scrip tural pas sages such as “The fet ter of the
heart is bro ken, all doubts are solved, all his works per ish when He
who is the higher and the lower has been be held” Mun. Up. II-2-8.
“The wise man freed from name and form goes to the di vine Per son

who is greater than the great” (Mun. Up. III.2-8). “When all de sires
which once en tered his heart are de stroyed then does the mor tal be -
come im mor tal, then he ob tains Brah man” (Bri. Up. IV-4-7).
No where you will find that the Pradhana and sim i lar en ti ties are
to be re sorted to by the eman ci pated.
We read in the Bri. Up. IV-4-21, “Let a wise Brahmana af ter he
has dis cov ered Him, prac tise wis dom. Let him not seek af ter many
words, be cause that is mere wea ri ness of the tongue.” For this rea -
son also the abode of heaven, earth, etc., is the Su preme Brah man.

**ZmZw_mZ_VÀN>ãXmV²Ÿ&**

**Nanumanamatacchabdat** I.3.3 (66)

(The abode of heaven etc.) is not that which is inferred i.e.
Pradhana because there is no term indicating it.

**Na:** not; **Anumanam:** that which is inferred i.e. **Pradhana; Atad
sabdat:** because there is no word denoting it.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
The abode re ferred to in Su tra 1 does not in di cate Pradhana be -
cause there is no such ex pres sion in the said Mundaka Upanishad as
can be con strued to in di cate Pradhana or mat ter. On the con trary
such terms as “He who knows all (Sarvajna) un der stands all
(Sarvavit)” (Mun. Up. I-1-9) in ti mate an in tel li gent be ing op posed to
Pradhana in na ture. For the same rea son the air (Sutratman) can not
be ac cepted as the abode of heaven, earth etc.

**Pranabhriccha** I.3.4 (67)

(Nor) also the individual soul.

The word ‘not’ is un der stood here from the pre ced ing Su tra.
Al though the in di vid ual soul is an in tel li gent be ing and can

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
In the text un der dis cus sion viz., “Know him alone as the Self
(At man)” (Mun. Up. II-2-5), there is a dec la ra tion of dif fer ence. The in -
di vid ual soul who is de sir ous of eman ci pa tion is the Knower and
abode of heaven is the thing to be known. Brah man which is de noted
by the word ‘Self’ and rep re sented as the ob ject of knowl edge is un -
der stood to be the abode of heaven, earth and so on.
For the fol low ing rea son also the in di vid ual soul can not be ac -

**Prakaranat** I.3.6 (69)

On account of the subject matter.

**Prakaranat:** On account of the subject matter, from the context.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
The Su preme Brah man is the sub ject mat ter of the en tire chap -
ter. You can un der stand this from the pas sage “Sir, what is that
through which when it is known, ev ery thing else be comes known?”
Mun. Up. I-1-3. Here the knowl edge of ev ery thing is said to be de -
pend ent on the knowl edge of one thing. Be cause all this i.e. the whole
uni verse be comes known if Brah man the Self of all is known, but not if
only the in di vid ual soul is known.
The Mundaka Upanishad be gins with ‘what is that through
which’ and con cludes by say ing “The knower of the Brah man be -
comes Brah man” III-2-9. This clearly in ti mates that the sub ject mat ter
of the whole Upanishad from the be gin ning to the end is Brah man
only. Hence it is the same Brah man which is spo ken of as the rest ing
place of heaven, earth and so on.
An other rea son against the in di vid ual soul is given in the fol low -
ing Su tra.

**Sthityadanabhyam cha** I.3.7 (70)

And on account of the two conditions of remaining unattached

**Sthiti:** abiding, existence; **Adanabhyam:** eating; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con cluded.
We read in Mundakopanishad III-1-1. “Two birds, in sep a ra ble
friends cling to the same tree. One of them eats the sweet fruit, the
other looks on (re mains as a wit ness).” The pas sage re fers to Brah -
man as Self-poised bliss and to the in di vid ual soul as eat ing the sweet
and bit ter fruits of ac tions. Here Brah man is de scribed as the si lent

wit ness. The pas sage de scribes the con di tion of mere in ac tive pres -
ence of Brah man. The in di vid ual soul eats the fruits of his works viz.
plea sure and pain and there fore he is dif fer ent from Brah man. The
two states viz. mere pres ence and the en joy ment in di cate that Brah -
man and the in di vid ual soul are re ferred to. This de scrip tion which
dis tin guishes the two can be apt only if the abode of heaven etc. is
Brah man. Oth er wise there will be no con ti nu ity of topic.
It can not be said that the pas sage merely de scribes the na ture
of the in di vid ual soul, be cause it is no where the pur pose of the scrip -
ture to de scribe the in di vid ual soul. The in di vid ual soul is known to ev -
ery one as agent and enjoyer. Or di nary ex pe ri ence tells us noth ing of
Brah man. Brah man is the spe cial topic of all scrip tural texts. The pur -
pose of the scrip tures is al ways to de scribe and es tab lish Brah man
which is not well known.

Bhumadhikaranam: Topic 2 (Sutras 8-9)
Bhuma is Brahman
```
**^y_mgåàgmXmXÜ`wnXoemV²Ÿ&**

**Bhuma samprasadadadhyupadesat** I.3.8 (71)
Bhuma (is Brahman) because it is taught after the state of
deep sleep (i.e. after Prana or the vital air which remains awake
even in that state).

**Bhuma:** the vast, the Infinite, the full; **Samprasadat adhi:** beyond the
state of deep sleep (here the vital principle or Prana); **Upadesat:**
because of the teaching.

The term ‘Bhuma’ does not de note nu mer i cal large ness but per -
va sion in the shape of fulness. Samprasada means the un dis turbed
place or bliss hence the state of deep sleep, when that bliss is en -
joyed. ‘Adhi’ means above, be yond.
Bhuma de notes Brah man, be cause it is de scribed in Sruti to be
above Prana, which is here rep re sented by the bliss en joyed dur ing
deep sleep. Bhuma re fers to Brah man as the pas sage teaches an en -
tity higher than Samprasada i.e. Prana or vi tal air which is awake and
ac tive even in deep sleep.
An ex pres sion from the Chhandogya Upanishad is now taken
up for dis cus sion. In the sev enth chap ter of the Chhandogya
Upanishad Sanatkumara gives in struc tions to Narada. He be gins
with ‘name’ and takes the stu dent step by step. He goes higher and
higher and ul ti mately teaches the high est truth which is Bhuma or the
In fi nite. Sanatkumara says to Narada “Bhuma is Bliss. You should de -
sire to un der stand where one sees noth ing else, hears noth ing else,
un der stands noth ing else, that is Bhuma.” VIII-22-24.
Here the doubt arises whether Bhuma is the vi tal air or Brah man
(the Su preme Self).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 82
```

The Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains that the vi tal air is
Bhuma. He says: Narada ap proaches Sanatkumara for ini ti a tion into
the mys ter ies of At man. We meet with a se ries of ques tions and an -
swers such as “Is there any thing greater than a name? Speech is
greater than name. Is there any thing greater than speech? Mind is
greater than speech which ex tends from name up to vi tal air”. Then
Narada does not ask whether there is any higher truth. But still
Sanatkumara gives an ex po si tion on Bhuma. This in ti mates that
Bhuma is not dif fer ent from the vi tal air taught al ready.
Fur ther he calls the knower of the vi tal air an Ativadin i.e., one
who makes a state ment sur pass ing pre ced ing state ments. This
clearly shows that the vi tal air is the high est Truth.
This Su tra re futes the ar gu ment and says that Bhuma is Brah -
man. Sanatkumara dis tinctly says to Narada—“But ver ily he is an
Ativadin who de clares the high est Be ing to be the True (Satya)” Chh.
Up. VII-16-1. This clearly in di cates that it re fers to some thing higher
than Prana or the vi tal air. One can be come truly an Ativadin by know -
ing this Su preme Truth only.
Though Narada does not ask Sanatkumara “Is there any thing
greater than the vi tal air?”, a new topic about Brah man (Bhuma)
which is the Su preme Truth is be gun. Narada said to Sanatkumara
“Sir, may I be come an Ativadin through the Truth.” Sanatkumara
leads Narada step by step, stage by stage to the knowl edge of Brah -
man or Bhuma and in structs him that this Bhuma is Brah man.
Narada at first lis tens to the in struc tion given by Sanatkumara
on var i ous mat ters, the last of which is Prana and then be comes si -
lent. There upon the wise Sanatkumara ex plains to him spon ta ne -
ously with out be ing asked that he only is an Ativadin who has
knowl edge of the High est Truth, and that the knowl edge of vi tal air
which is an un real prod uct is des ti tute of sub stance. By the term “The
True” is meant the Su preme Brah man, be cause Brah man is the only
Re al ity. Sanatkumara there upon leads Narada by a se ries of steps
be gin ning with un der stand ing up to the knowl edge of Bhuma. We,
there fore, con clude that the Bhuma is the Su preme Brah man, and
that it is dif fer ent from Prana or the vi tal air.
If Prana or the vi tal air were the Bhuma then Sanatkumara
would not have con tin ued his in struc tions. He would have stopped his
in struc tions af ter say ing “Prana is greater than hope” (VII-15-1). But
he gives a clear de scrip tion of the na ture of Bhuma in Sec tions 23, 24,
25 of the same chap ter. There fore Bhuma alone is Brah man or the
High est Truth.
Self hood does not be long to Prana. More over one can free him -
self from grief only by knowl edge of the Su preme Brah man. Brah man
only is All Full. Bhuma means also fulness. The qual ity of the Bhuma
agrees best with the Su preme Brah man which is the cause, source,
sup port and sub stra tum for ev ery thing. Bhuma is taught as the last of
the se ries. It is In fi nite Bliss. There fore it is the high est of all.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 3 83
```

The med i ta tion on Prana is higher than med i ta tion on Name up
to hope. There fore he who thus med i tates on Prana is called an
Ativadin. He is an Ativadin com pared with those be low him. But the
med i ta tion on the Su preme Brah man is su pe rior even to that on
Prana. Hence he who med i tates on Brah man or the Bhuma is the real
Ativadin.
Narada thought that the in struc tion about the At man is now
com pleted. There fore he did not ask any fur ther ques tion.
Sanatkumara knew that the knowl edge of Prana is not the high est
knowl edge. There fore he spon ta ne ously con tin ues his teach ing to
Narada and tells him that the knowl edge of Brah man or the Bhuma is
the high est knowl edge. The Srutis say that Prana springs from Brah -
man. There fore Prana is in fe rior to Brah man. Brah man alone is the
Bhuma of the pas sage of the Chhandogya Upanishad un der dis cus -
sion.

**Y_m}nnÎmoüŸ&**

**Dharmopapattescha** I.3.9 (72)

And because the attributes (declared in the scriptural passage
to Bhuma) apply appropriately only to Para Brahman.

**Dharma:** qualities, attributes; **Upapatteh:** because of the suitability;
**Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 8 is given.
The at trib utes which the scrip ture at trib utes to the Bhuma agree
well with Brah man. In the Bhuman the or di nary ac tiv i ties of see ing
etc. are ab sent. The Sruti de clares “where one sees noth ing else,
hears noth ing else, un der stands noth ing else, that is the Bhuma”. We
know from an other text that this is the char ac ter is tic of the Su preme
Self. “But when the At man only is all this, how could he see an other?”
Bri. Up. IV-5-15.
The qual i ties of be ing the True, rest ing on its own great ness,
non-du al ity, bliss, In fi nite ness, the self of ev ery thing, Om ni pres ence,
Im mor tal ity etc., men tioned in the text un der dis cus sion can be long to
the Su preme only, not to Prana which is an ef fect and as such can not
pos sess any of these at trib utes.
By all this it is proved that the Bhuma is the Su preme Self or
Brah man.

Aksharadhikaranam: Topic 3 (Sutras 10-12)
Akshara is Brahman
```
**Aja_å~amÝVY¥Vo...Ÿ&**

**Aksharamambarantadhriteh** I.3.10 (73)

The Imperishable (is Brahman) on account of (its) supporting
everything up to Akasa (ether).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 84
```

**Aksharam:** the Imperishable; **Ambaranta dhriteh:** because it

supports all up to Akasa.
An ex pres sion from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is now
taken up for dis cus sion. We read in Bri. Up. III-8-7, “In what then is the
ether wo ven like warp and woof?” Gargi put this ques tion to sage
Yajnavalkya. He re plied: “O Gargi, the Brahmanas call this Akshara
(the Im per ish able). It is nei ther coarse nor fine, nei ther short nor long
etc.” Bri. Up. III-8-8. Here the doubt arises whether the word ‘Akshara’
means syl la ble ‘OM’ or Brah man. The Purvapakshin or the op po nent
main tains that ‘Akshara’ ety mo logi cally means a syl la ble and there -
fore gen er ally rep re sents the syl la ble OM, which is also an ob ject of
med i ta tion. We have no right to dis re gard the set tled mean ing of a
word.
This Su tra re futes the above view and says that ‘Akshara here
stands for Brah man only’. Why? Be cause the Akshara is said to sup -
port ev ery thing from earth up to ether. The text says “In that Akshara,
Gargi! is the ether wo ven like warp and woof” Bri. UP. III-8-11. Now
the at trib ute of sup port ing ev ery thing up to ether can not be as cribed
to any be ing but Brah man.
More over “It is nei ther coarse nor fine, nei ther short nor long”
etc., in di cates that rel a tive qual i ties are ab sent in it. There fore the
‘Akshara’ is Brah man. The ob jec tor says: But even Pradhana sup -
ports ev ery thing up to ether, be cause it is the cause of all the mod i fied
ob jects in the uni verse and so the Akshara or the Im per ish able may
be Pradhana. To this doubt the fol low ing Su tra gives an an swer.

**gm M àemgZmV²Ÿ&**

**Sa cha prasasanat** I.3. 1 1 (74)

This (supporting) on account of the command (attributed to
the Imperishable, can be the work of the Supreme Self only
and not of the Pradhana).

**Sa:** this (the quality of supporting everything up to ether); **Cha:** and,

also; **Prasasanat:** because of the command.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 10 is given.
The sup port ing of all things up to ether is the work of the High est
Self only. Why? On ac count of the com mand. The text speaks of a
com mand “By the com mand of that Akshara O Gargi! the sun and the
moon stand apart” Bri. Up. III-8-9.
This com mand or rul er ship can be the work of the high est Lord
only, not of the non-in tel li gent Pradhana. Be cause non-in tel li gent
causes such as clay and the like can not com mand their ef fects such
as jars and the like. There fore the Pradhana can not be the ‘Akshara’
which sup ports ev ery thing up to Akasa or ether.

**AÝ`^mdì`md¥ÎmoüŸ&**

**Anyabhavavyavrittescha** I.3.12 (75)

And on account of (the Sruti) separating (the Akshara) from

that nature is different (from Brahman).

**Anya:** another; **Bhava:** nature; **Vyavritteh:** on account of the
exclusion; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 10 is con cluded.
The Im per ish able (Akshara) is not Pradhana or Jiva, be cause in
the same text we find de scrip tion of at trib utes which would ex clude
an other na ture than Brah man. In a sup ple men tary pas sage in the
same Upanishad we find de scrip tion of this Akshara which ex cludes
Pradhana and Jiva, be cause they do not pos sess that na ture.
The qual i ties re ferred to in the text namely, see ing, hear ing,
think ing, know ing etc., “That Akshara, O Gargi! is un seen but see ing,
un heard but hear ing, un per ceived but per ceiv ing, un known but know -
ing. There is no other seer but He, no other hearer but He, no other
thinker but He, no other knower but He. In that Im per ish able O Gargi!
the ether is wo ven warp and woof” (Bri. Up. III-8-11), point to an in tel li -

The word ‘Akshara’ can not de note the in di vid ual soul as he is
not free from lim it ing ad juncts, from which Akshara is free. The Srutis
say “Akshara is with out eyes, with out ears, with out speech, with out
mind etc.” (Bri. Up. III-8-8).
There fore it is a set tled con clu sion that the Akshara or the im -

The Highest person to be meditated upon is the Highest Brahman

**B©j{VH$_©ì`nXoemËg...Ÿ&**

**Ikshatikarmavyapadesat sah** I.3.13 (76)

Because of His being mentioned as the object of sight, He (who

is to be meditated upon is Brahman).

**Ikshati:** seeing, realising; **Karma:** object; **Vyapadesat:** because of
his being mentioned; **Sah:** he.

An ex pres sion from the Prasnopanishad is taken up now for dis -
cus sion.
The High est Brah man is de scribed as He is stated to be the ob -
ject of Ikshana (reali sa tion by vi sion). The ref er ence is clearly to the
Su preme Self as the ob ject of Ikshana.
We read in Prasna Upanishad V-2 “O Satyakama, the syl la ble
OM is the high est and also the other Brah man; there fore he who

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 86

knows it ar rives by the same means at one of the two”. The text then
goes on “Again he who med i tates with the syl la ble Om of three
Matras (A-U-M) on the High est Per son” Prasna Up. V-5. A doubt
arises whether the ob ject of med i ta tion is the High est Brah man or the
lower Brah man, be cause in V-2 both are men tioned, and also be -
cause Brahmaloka is de scribed as the fruit by the wor ship of this
High est Per son.
The Su tra says: What is here taught as the ob ject of med i ta tion
is the High est Brah man and not Hiranyagarbha (the lower Brah man).
Why? On ac count of its be ing spo ken of as the ob ject of sight—“He
sees the High est Per son”. This in ti mates that he ac tu ally real ises or
gets him self iden ti fied with the High est Per son. Hiranyagarbha also is
un real from the high est or tran scen den tal view point. He is within the
realm of Maya. He is as so ci ated with Maya. There fore the High est
Per son means the High est Brah man only which is the only Re al ity.
This very Brah man is taught at the be gin ning of the pas sage as the
ob ject of med i ta tion.
The Sruti de clares that the re lease from evil is the fruit of med i -
ta tion “As a snake is freed from its skin, so is he freed from evil”. This
clearly in di cates that the Su preme con sti tutes the ob ject of med i ta -
tion.
The at tain ment of Brahmaloka by the wor ship per should not be
con sid ered as an in ap pro pri ate or in sig nif i cant fruit of the wor ship of
the High est Per son, be cause it is a step in grad ual lib er a tion or eman -
ci pa tion by de grees (Krama Mukti). He who med i tates on the Su -
preme Self by means of the syl la ble OM as con sist ing of the Matras,
ob tains for his first re ward Brahmaloka and af ter that Kaivalya
Moksha or one ness with Su preme Brah man.
In Prasna Upanishad we read “He ar rives at this by means of
the Omkara; the wise ar rives at that which is at rest, free from de cay,
from death, from fear, the High est”. Free from de cay, free from death,
free from fear, the High est can ap ply only to the Su preme Brah man
and not to the lower Brah man.
The word Brahmaloka does not mean the Loka of Brah man but
the Loka or con di tion which is Brah man Him self, just as we ex plain
the com pound word Nishadasthapati, not as the head man of the
Nishadas but a head man who at the same time is a Nishada. It is a
Karmadharaya com pound which does not mean the “world of Brah -
man, but that world which is Brah man.”

Daharadhikaranam: Topic 5 (Sutras 14-21)
The Dahara or the ‘Small Akasa’ is Brahman
```
**Xha CÎmaoä`...Ÿ&**

**Dahara uttarebhyah** I.3.14 (77)

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 3 87
```

The small (ether, Akasa, is Brahman) on account of the

subsequent arguments or expression).

**Daharah:** the small; **Uttarebhyah:** from subsequent texts or

expressions or arguments.

An other ex pres sion from the Chhandogya Upanishad is taken
up for dis cus sion.
‘Dahara’ re fers to Brah man, be cause the rea son stated in the
later por tions of the pas sage show this clearly.
We read in Chhandogya Upanishad VIII-1-1 “Now there is this
city of Brah man (the body), and in it the place, the small lo tus (the
heart) and in it that small ether (Akasa)”. Now what ex ists within that
small ether is to be sought, that is to be un der stood.
Here the doubt arises whether the small ether within the small
lo tus of the heart, which the Sruti speaks, is the el e men tal ether, or
the in di vid ual soul, or the Su preme Soul.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: By the small ether we
have to un der stand the el e men tal ether which is the or di nary mean ing
of the word. It is here called small with ref er ence to its small abode,
the heart. Or else the ‘small one’ may be taken to mean the in di vid ual
soul on ac count of the term the city of Brah man (Brahmapuri). The
body is here called the city of Brah man be cause the in di vid ual soul
has his abode in the body, and has ac quired this by his deeds. The in -
di vid ual soul is here called Brah man in a met a phor i cal sense. The Su -
preme Brah man can not be meant, be cause He is not linked with the
body as its Lord. The Lord of the city i.e., the in di vid ual soul re sides in
one spot of the city viz., the heart, just as a King dwells in one spot of
his King dom. Fur ther the mind, the lim it ing ad junct of the in di vid ual
soul, abides in the heart. Only the in di vid ual soul is com pared in the
Sruti in size to the point of a goad.
Here the ‘small Akasa’ is Brah man and does not mean el e men -
tal ether, al though there is the qual i fi ca tion ‘small’ which may in di cate
that he is a lim ited some thing. Why? Be cause the na ture of Brah man
is de scribed later on in the text “As large as this (ex ter nal) ether is, so
large is that Akasa within the heart. Both heaven and earth are con -
tained within it.” Chh. Up. VIII 1-3. This clearly in ti mates that it is not
ac tu ally small.
Akasa can not be com pared with it self. The fi nite in di vid ual soul
also with its lim it ing ad juncts can not be com pared with the all-per vad -
ing Akasa or ether. The Sruti de clares “Both the earth and heaven are
con tained in it”. This in di cates that this Akasa is the sup port of the
whole world. From this it is man i fest that the ether is the Su preme
Self.
We read in the Chhandogya Upanishad VIII-1-5 “The Self or At -
man is sin less, age less, death less, griefless, free from old age, hun -

ger, thirst, with true de sire (Satkama), true thought (Satsankalpa) that
ever co mes true”. This can not ap ply to mere phys i cal ether. These
are all dis tinct qual i ties of the Su preme Brah man. The de scrip tion
can not re fer to the in di vid ual soul, be cause the com par i son to the in fi -
nite ether and the state ment that heaven and earth are con tained in it
can not ap ply to the fi nite in di vid ual soul.
The word ‘Brahma’ in Brahmapuri shows the ref er ence to Brah -
man only. Even if you take the word as re fer ring to Jiva the teach ing
re lates to Brah man who is real ised in the heart which is the
Brahmapuri (the city of soul or Brah man). More over the prom ise of In -
fi nite Bliss to the knower of Dahara Akasa in ti mates that the ref er ence
is only to the Su preme Brah man.
For all the rea sons ex plained, that ether is the High est Self or
Su preme Brah man.

**Gatisabdabhyam tatha hi drishtam lingam cha** I.3.15 (78)

The small Akasa (ether) is Brahman on account of the action of
going (into Brahman) and of the word (Brahmaloka); because
thus it is seen (i.e. the individual souls go into Brahman) is
seen elsewhere in other Sruti texts; and this daily going of the
souls into Brahman (during deep sleep) is an inferential sign
by means of which we may properly interpret the word
‘Brahmaloka’).

**Gatisabdabhyam:** on account of the going and of the word; **Tatha hi:**
thus, like; **Drishtam:** it is seen; **Lingam:** mark, sign from which
something may be inferred; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 14 is given.
It has been said in the pre ced ing Su tra that the small ether is
Brah man on ac count of the rea sons given in the sub se quent pas -
sages. These sub se quent pas sages are now de scribed.
The men tion of ‘go ing’ and a ‘word’ re fers to Brah man. We read
in Chhandogya Upanishad VIII-3-2 “All these crea tures day af ter day
go into this Brahmaloka (i.e. they are merged in Brah man dur ing deep
sleep) and yet do not dis cover it” etc. This pas sage shows that all
Jivas or in di vid ual souls go daily into the ‘small Akasa’ called here
Brahmaloka. This in ti mates that the ‘small Akasa’ is Brah man.
This go ing of the in di vid ual souls into Brah man which oc curs
daily in the deep sleep is men tioned in the other Sruti text: “He be -
comes united with the true (Sat), he is merged in his own Self” Chh.
Up. VI-8-1.
In com mon par lance or or di nary life also we say of a man who is
in deep sleep “He has be come Brah man”. “He is gone into the state of
Brah man”.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 3 89
```

The word ‘Brahmaloka’ is to be in ter preted as Brah man Him self,
and not as the world of Brah man (Satya Loka) be cause there is the
indicatory sign in the pas sage. What is that indicatory sign or Lin gam?
It is said in the text that the soul goes to this world daily. It is cer tainly

im pos si ble for the Jiva to go to the world of Brah man daily. Hence the
term ‘Brahmaloka’ means here Brah man Him self.

**Y¥Voü _{håZmo@ñ`mpñ_ÞwnbãYo...Ÿ&**

**Dhritescha mahimno’syasminnupalabdheh** I.3.16 (79)
Moreover on account of the supporting also (attributed to it)
the small ether must be Brahman, because this greatness is
observed in this (Brahman only according to other scriptural
passages).

**Dhriteh:** on account of supporting (of the world by the Akasa or
ether); **Cha:** and, moreover, also; **Asya mahimnah:** this greatness;
**Asmin:** in Brahman; **Upalabdheh:** on account of being observed or
found.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 14 is con tin ued.
Daharakasa or the small ether re ferred to in Su tra 14 in di cates
Brah man, as the glory of sup port ing all the worlds can be rea son ably

true only in re spect of Brah man. And also on ac count of the ‘sup port -
ing’ the small ether can be the Su preme Brah man only. How? To be -
gin with the text in tro duces the gen eral sub ject of dis cus sion in the

pas sage “In it is that small ether”. Then the small ether is to be com -
pared with the uni ver sal ether. Ev ery thing is con tained in it. Then the
term Self is ap plied to it. Then it is stated that it is free from sin etc. Fi -

nally it is said “That Self is a bank, a lim it ing sup port (Vidhriti) so that
these worlds may not be con founded” (Chh. Up. VIII-4-1). In this pas -
sage the glory of small ether by way of sup port ing the worlds is seen.

Just as a dam stores the wa ter so that the bound aries of the fields are
not con founded, so also that Self serves like a dam in or der that the
world and all the dif fer ent castes and Asramas may not be con -

founded.
Other texts de clare that this great ness of sup port ing be longs to

Brah man alone. “By the com mand of that Im per ish able (Akshara) O
Gargi, the sun and moon are held in their po si tions” Bri. Up. III-8-9.
“He is the lord of all, the king of all kings, the pro tec tor of all things. He

is a bank and a lim it ing sup port, so that these worlds may not be con -
founded” Bri. Up. IV-4-22. This also shows that to be a bound ary and
sup port of the worlds is the dis tinc tive at trib ute of Brah man only.

There fore, on ac count of the ‘sup port ing’ also, the small (ether) is
noth ing else but Brah man.

Also because of the well-known meaning (of Akasa as

**Prasiddheh:** of the well-known (meaning); **Cha:** also

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 14 is con tin ued.
Akasa has the set tled mean ing of Brah man. It is a well-known
fact in Sruti that Brah man is in di cated by the term Akasa. There fore
‘Daharakasa’ also stands for Brah man.
We read in Chh. Up. VIII-14-1 “Akasa is the revealer of all
names and forms”. “All these be ings take their or i gin from Akasa
alone” Chh. Up. I-9-1. “For who could breathe if that Akasa (ether)
were not bliss” Tait. Up. II-7. In all these texts ‘Akasa’ stands for Brah -
man.

**Itaraparamarsat sa iti chen nasambhavat** I.3.18 (81)

If it is said that the other one (i.e. the individual soul) is meant

on account of a reference to it (made in a complementary

passage) (we say) no, on account of the impossibility.

**Itara:** the other one, that is the Jiva; **Paramarsat:** on account of
reference; **Sa:** he (the individual soul); **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not;
**Asambhavat:** on account of impossibility.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 14 is con tin ued. We read in
the Chhandogya Upanishad—“Now that se rene be ing, the in di vid ual
soul (Jiva) in deed which hav ing risen above this earthly body, and
hav ing reached the high est light, ap pears in its true form, that is the
Self: thus he spoke.”
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: As in the com ple men -
tary pas sage the in di vid ual soul is re ferred to, the small Akasa of Chh.
Up. VIII-1-1 is also the in di vid ual soul. “The word ‘se ren ity’
(Samprasada) which de notes the state of deep sleep con veys the
idea of the in di vid ual soul only. The ‘ris ing from the body’ also can be
spo ken of the in di vid ual soul only whose abode is there fore ‘the small
Akasa’; this de notes in the pas sage un der dis cus sion only the in di vid -
ual soul, on ac count of ref er ence to the ether.”
This can not be. In the first place the in di vid ual soul which is lim -
ited by the in ter nal or gan and its other ad juncts, can not be com pared
with the all-per vad ing ether.
In the sec ond place, the at trib utes like ‘free dom from evil’ and
the likes of this Akasa, re ferred to in the pas sage un der dis cus sion,
can not be true of the in di vid ual soul. Hence Brah man is meant in that
pas sage.

**Uttaracchedavirbhutasvarupastu** I.3.19 (82)

If it be said that for subsequent texts (it appears that the
individual soul is meant, we say that what is there referred to
is) rather (the individual soul in so far) as its real nature has
become manifest (i.e. as it is non-different from Brahman).

**Uttarat:** from the subsequent texts of the Sruti; **Chet:** if;
**Avirbhuta-svarupat:** with its true nature made manifest; **Tu:** but.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 14 is con tin ued.
An ob jec tion is again raised by the Purvapakshin to jus tify that
the ‘small Akasa’ (Dahara) re fers to the in di vid ual soul. Prajapati at
the out set de clares that the Self, which is free from sin and the like is
that which we must try to un der stand Chh. Up. VIII-7-1. Af ter that he
points out that the seer within the eye i.e. ‘the in di vid ual soul is the
Self’, Chh. Up. VIII-7-3. He again ex plains the na ture of the same in di -
vid ual soul in its dif fer ent states. “He who moves about happy in
dreams is the Self” Chh. Up. VIII-10-1. “When a man be ing asleep, re -
pos ing, and at per fect rest sees no dreams, that is the Self” Chh. Up.
VIII-1l-1. The qual i fy ing terms ‘Im mor tal, fear less’ used in each of
these de scrip tions of the self show that the in di vid ual soul is free from
sin or evil and the like. Ob vi ously the in di vid ual soul is meant here be -
cause Brah man is free from the three states viz. wak ing, dream and
deep sleep. It is also said to be free from evil. There fore ‘small Akasa’
re fers to the in di vid ual soul or Jiva and not to Brah man.
The Su tra re futes this. The Su tra uses the ex pres sion “He
whose na ture has be come man i fest”. Prajapati fi nally ex plains the in -
di vid ual soul in its true na ture as iden ti cal with Brah man. The ref er -
ence is to the in di vid ual soul in its true na ture as iden ti cal with
Brah man or, in other words, who has real ised his one ness with Brah -
man and not to the in di vid ual soul as such. “As soon as it has ap -
proached the high est light it ap pears in its own form. Then It is the
High est Purusha” Chh. Up. VIII-12-3. The in di vid ual soul is free from
evil etc., when it be comes iden ti cal with Brah man and not when it is
en vel oped by lim it ing ad juncts and re mains as the fi nite Jiva or em -
bod ied soul. Agency (Kartritva), en joy ing (Bhoktritva), like and dis like
(Raga-dvesha) in di cate Jivahood. If these are re moved the in di vid ual
soul shines as Brah man.
As long as the in di vid ual soul does not free it self from Avidya (ig -
no rance) in the form of du al ity and does not rise to the knowl edge of
the Self or Brah man, whose na ture is un change able and
Satchidananda which ex presses it self in the form ‘I am Brah man’, so
long it re mains as an in di vid ual soul. The ig no rance of the Jiva may be
com pared to the mis take of a man who in the twi light mis takes a post
for a man, a rope for a ser pent.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 92
```

When it gives up the iden ti fi ca tion with the body, sense or gans
and mind, when it real ises its iden tity with the Su preme Brah man it
be comes Brah man it self whose na ture is un change able and
Satchidananda, as is de clared in Mun. Up. III-2-9 “He who knows the
high est Brah man be comes even Brah man”. This is the real na ture of
the in di vid ual soul by means of which it arises from the body and ap -
pears in its own real form.
Why a ref er ence has at all been made to Jiva in this Sec tion
treat ing of Dahara, you will find an an swer in the fol low ing Su tra.

**AÝ`mW©ü nam_e©...**

**Anyarthascha paramarsah** I.3.20 (83)
And the reference (to the individual soul) is for a different
purpose.

**Anyarthah:** for a different purpose; **Cha:** and; **Paramarsah:**
reference.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 14 is con tin ued.
The ref er ence to the in di vid ual soul has a dif fer ent mean ing.
The ref er ence to the in di vid ual soul is not meant to de ter mine the na -
ture of the in di vid ual soul, but rather the na ture of the Su preme Brah -
man. The ref er ence to the three states of the in di vid ual soul is meant
not to es tab lish the na ture of Jiva as such, but to show fi nally its real
na ture (Svarupa) which is not dif fer ent from Brah man.
An other ob jec tion is raised. The text de scribes this ‘Dahara’ as
oc cu py ing a very small space in the heart, and be cause ‘Dahara’ is so
small and Jiva is also small, there fore, ‘Dahara’ must be Jiva men -
tioned sub se quently. The fol low ing Su tra gives a suit able an swer.

**Alpasruteriti chet taduktam** I.3.21 (84)

**Alpasruteh:** because of the Sruti declaring its smallness; **Iti:** thus;
**Chet:** if; **Tat:** that; **Uktam:** has already been explained.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 14 is con cluded.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor has stated that the small ness
of the ether stated by the Sruti “In it is that small ether” does not agree
with Brah man, that it may how ever re fer to the Jiva or the in di vid ual
soul which is com pared to the point of a goad. This has al ready been
re futed. It has al ready been shown un der I.2.7 that small ness may be
at trib uted to Brah man for the pur pose of med i ta tion (Upasana). The
same ref u ta tion is to be ap plied here also. That small ness is con tra -
dicted by that Sruti text which com pares the ether within the heart with

Everything shines after Brahman
```
**AZwH¥$VoñVñ` MŸ&**

**Anukritestasya cha** I.3.22 (85)

On account of the acting after (i.e. the shining after) (that after
which sun, moon, etc. are said to shine is the Supreme Self)
and (because by the light) of Him (everything else is lighted).

**Anukriteh** : because of the acting after, from imitation, from the
following; **Tasya:** its; **Cha:** and.

A pas sage from the Mundaka Upanishad is taken now for dis -
cus sion.
We read in Mundaka Upanishad II-2-10 and Kathopanisad
II-ii-15 “The Sun does not shine there nor the moon and the stars, nor
these lightnings, much less the fire. Af ter him when he shines ev ery -
thing shines; by the light of him all this is lighted.”
Now a doubt arises whether “he af ter whom when he shines ev -
ery thing shines, and by whose light all this is lighted” is some ef ful gent
sub stance, or the Su preme Self.
The ‘shin ing af ter’ men tioned in the text “Af ter him when he
shines ev ery thing shines” is pos si ble only if the Su preme Self or
Brah man is un der stood. An other Sruti de clares of that Su preme Self,
“His form is light, his thoughts are true” Chh. Up. III-14-2. “Him the
gods wor ship as the light of lights, as im mor tal time” Bri. Up. IV-4-16.
The clause “On ac count of the act ing af ter” points to the ‘shin ing
af ter’ men tioned in the text un der dis cus sion.
That the light of the Sun etc., should shine by some other ma te -
rial light is not known. It is ab surd to say that one light is lighted by an -
other. We do not know of any phys i cal light, ex cept the sun, that can
light Brah man.
The man i fes ta tion of this whole uni verse has for its cause the
ex is tence of the light of Brah man, just as the ex is tence of the light of
the sun is the cause of the man i fes ta tion of all form and colours. Brah -
man is self-lu mi nous. It re mains in Its own glory. It il lu mines the sun,
the moon, the stars, the light ning, the fire, the senses, the mind and
the in tel lect and all ob jects. It does not need any other light to il lu mine
it. Sruti texts like “Brah man is the light of lights ( _Jyotisham Jyotih_ )”
clearly in ti mate that Brah man is Self-ef ful gent. It is quite pos si ble to
deny the shin ing of sun, moon etc., with ref er ence to Brah man, be -
cause what ever is seen is seen by the light of Brah man only. As Brah -
man is Self-ef ful gent, it is not seen by means of any other light.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 94
```

Brah man man i fests ev ery thing else but is not man i fested by
any thing else. We read in Bri. Up. “By the Self alone as his light man
sits” IV-3-6. The word ‘Sarvam’ de notes that the en tire world of names
and forms is de pend ent on the glory of Brah man. The word ‘anu’ in ti -
mates that the ref er ence is to Brah man be cause it is from Him that all
ef ful gence is de rived.

**A{n M ñ_`©VoŸ&**

**Api cha smaryate** I.3.23 (86)

Moreover the Smriti also speaks of him i.e. Brahman to be the
universal light.

**Api cha:** moreover, also; **Smaryate:** the Smriti states.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 22 is given.
The Smriti or Gita also says so. In Gita, Chap ter XV-6 we read
“Nei ther the sun, nor the moon, nor the fire il lu mines that, hav ing gone
into which men do not re turn, that is My high est seat.” And “The light
which abid ing in the sun il lu mines the whole world and that which is in

Pramitadhikaranam: Topic 7 (Sutras 24-25)
The person of the size of a thumb is Brahman
```
**eãXmXod à{_V...Ÿ&**

**Sabdadeva pramitah** I.3.24 (87)
From the very word (viz., the term Lord applied to it) the
(person) measured (by the size of the thumb) (is Brahman).

**Sabdat** : from the very word; **Eva:** even, only, itself; **Pramitah:**
measured, i.e., described as having the size of the thumb.

An ex pres sion from the Kathopanishad is taken up for dis cus -
sion.
We read in Kathopanishad II-4-12, “The per son of the size of a
thumb re sides in the mid dle or cen tre of the body etc.” and in II-4-13
“That per son, of the size of a thumb is like a light with out smoke, lord
of the past and of the fu ture, he is the same to day and to mor row.
Know ing Him one does not seek to hide one self any more. This is
That.”
A doubt arises now whether the per son of the size of a thumb
men tioned in the text is the in di vid ual soul or the Su preme Self (Brah -
man).
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent holds that on ac count of the
state ment of the per son’s size of thumb the in di vid ual soul is meant,
be cause to the Su preme Self which is In fi nite the Sruti text would not
as cribe the mea sure of a thumb.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 3 95
```

To this we re ply that the per son of the size of a thumb can only
be Brah man. Why? On ac count of the term ‘Isana’, ‘Lord of the past
and of the fu ture.’ The high est Lord only is the ab so lute ruler of the
past and the fu ture. Fur ther the clause “This is that” con nects the pas -
sage with that which had been en quired about, and there fore forms
the topic of dis cus sion. What had been en quired about by Nachiketas
is Brah man. Nachiketas asks Lord Yama, “That which thou seest as
nei ther this nor that, as nei ther ef fect nor cause, as nei ther past nor
fu ture, tell me that” (Katha Up. I-2-14). Yama re fers to this per son of
the size of a thumb thus “That which you wanted to know is this.”
Brah man is said to be of the size of a thumb, though He is
all-per vad ing, be cause He is reali sable in the lim ited cham ber of the
heart of a man.
The ep i thet ‘The Lord of the past and the fu ture’, can not be ap -
plied to Jiva at all, whose past and the fu ture is bound by his Kar mas
and who is not free to pos sess so much glory.
But how the all-per vad ing Lord can be said to be lim ited by the
mea sure of a thumb? The fol low ing Su tra gives a suit able an swer.

**öÚnoj`m Vw _Zwî`m{YH$maËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Hridyapekshaya tu manushyadhikaratvat** I.3.25 (88)

But with reference to the heart (the highest Brahman is said to
be of the size of a thumb) as man alone is entitled (to the study
of the Vedas, to practise meditation and attain
Self-realisation).

**Hridi:** in the heart, with reference to the heart; **Apekshaya:** by
reference to, in consideration of; **Tu:** but; **Manushyadhikaratvat:**
because of the privilege of men.

A qual i fy ing ex pla na tion of Su tra 24 is given, and the priv i lege
for Upasana or med i ta tion is dis cussed.
The mea sure of a thumb is as cribed to Brah man, al though
all-per vad ing, which with ref er ence to his re sid ing within the heart
which is gen er ally as big as the thumb. Brah man dwells within the
heart of all liv ing be ings. The hearts dif fer ac cord ing to the an i mals,
some have larger hearts, some have smaller, some are more than a
thumb, some are less than a thumb. Why is the ‘thumb’ used as a
stan dard? Why a man’s heart only and not that of any other an i mal,
also? The sec ond half of the Su tra gives an an swer—‘on ac count of
man only be ing en ti tled’. Man only is en ti tled to the study of the Vedas
and prac tice of med i ta tion and dif fer ent Upasanas of Brah man pre -
scribed in them. There fore the thumb is used as the stan dard of mea -
sure ment with ref er ence to him alone.
The aim here is to show the iden tity of in di vid ual soul with Brah -
man which is in side the body and is of the size of a thumb. The
Vedanta pas sages have two fold pur port. Some of them aim in giv ing

a de scrip tion of the na ture of Brah man, some in teach ing the unity of
the in di vid ual soul with the Su preme Soul. Our pas sage teaches the
unity of the in di vid ual soul with the Su preme Soul or Brah man, not the
size of any thing. This point is ren dered quite clear fur ther on in the
Upanishad. “The per son of the size of a thumb, the in ner Self, al ways
abides in the heart of men. Let a man draw that Self forth from his
body with steadi ness, as one draws the pith from a reed. Let him

Also (beings) above them (viz., men) (are entitled for the study
and practice of the Vedas) on account of the possibility (of it)
according to Baadarayana.

**Tad upari:** above them i.e. higher than men namely Devas; **Api:** also,
even; **Baadarayanah:** the sage Baadarayana is of opinion;
**Sambhavat:** because (it is) possible.

The de scrip tion of the priv i lege of study of Vedas and med i ta tion
is con tin ued.
There is a di gres sion from the main topic in this Sec tion in
Sutras 26 to 38. The Purvapakshin or the op po nent holds that such
med i ta tion is not pos si ble in the case of the Devas, be cause they are
not en dowed with the sense or gans. Hence they have got no ca pa bil -
ity to med i tate. The Devas like Indra and the rest are mere thought
forms cre ated by the chant ing of Mantras. They have no de sire for the
pos ses sion of Vairagya (dispassion), Viveka (dis crim i na tion) etc. To
this the au thor gives a re ply in this Su tra. A doubt may arise from the
pre vi ous Su tra that as it is stated that men alone have the priv i lege to
the study of the Vedas, the gods are thereby de barred. This Su tra re -
moves this doubt.
The teacher Baadarayana thinks that the Su tra en ti tles gods
also who are above men for the study of Vedas, prac tice of med i ta tion
and at tain ment of knowl edge of Brah man. How? Be cause it is pos si -
ble for them also as they too are cor po real be ings. The Upanishads,
the Man tra por tion of the Vedas, the Itihasas and the Puranas all
unan i mously de scribe that the Devas have bod ies. They may have
the de sire of fi nal re lease caused by the re flec tion that all ef fects, ob -
jects and power are non-per ma nent. They may have the de sire to
pos sess the four fold qual i fi ca tion which is nec es sary for at tain ing the
knowl edge of Brah man. The gods un dergo dis ci ple ship in or der to at -
tain knowl edge. We read in Chh. Up. VIII-7-11 “Indra lived as a dis ci -

ple with Prajapati for one hun dred and one years”; “Bhrigu Varuni
went to his fa ther Varuna, say ing, sir, teach me Brah man” Tait. Up.
III-1. The god Varuna pos sessed the knowl edge of Brah man which he
teaches to his son Bhrigu.
The gods also pos sess all the req ui sites for prac tis ing med i ta -
tion. There fore they are also en ti tled for the study of the Vedas and at -
tain ing Self-reali sa tion. Even with out Upanayana and study the Veda
is man i fest of it self to the gods.
The pas sage about that which is of the size of a thumb is equally
valid when the right of the gods is ac cepted. In their case the Sruti de -
scrib ing the Lord of the size of a thumb re fers to the size of their
thumbs.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says if we ad mit that Devas
have bod ies, then there would arise dif fi cul ties with re gard to sac ri -
fices, be cause it is not pos si ble for one fi nite cor po real be ing like
Indra to be si mul ta neously pres ent at many places of sac ri fices, when
he is in voked si mul ta neously by all his wor ship pers. There fore sac ri -
fices will be come use less. To this ob jec tion the au thor gives a suit able
re ply in the fol low ing Su tra.

**Virodhah karmaniti chet na
anekapratipatterdarsanat** I.3.27 (90)
If it be said that (the corporeality of the gods involves) a
contradiction to sacrifices; (we say) no, because we find (in the
scriptures) the assumption (by the gods) of many (forms at one
and the same time).

**Virodhah:** contradiction; **Karmani:** In the sacrifices; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:**
if; **Na:** not; **Aneka:** many (bodies); **Pratipatteh:** because of the
assumption; **Darsanat:** because it is found (in the scriptures).

An ob jec tion against Su tra 26 is raised and re futed.
It is pos si ble for a Devata to as sume sev eral forms at the same
time. He can ap pear in sac ri fices per formed si mul ta neously at dif fer -
ent places. Smriti also states “A Yogin, O hero of the Bharatas, may by
his power mul ti ply his self in many thou sand forms and in them walk
about on earth. In some he may en joy the ob jects, in oth ers he may
un dergo dire pen ance, and fi nally he may again with draw them all,
just as the sun with draws its many rays”. If such Smriti pas sage de -
clares that even Yogins, who have merely ac quired var i ous ex traor di -
nary pow ers, such as sub tlety of body and the like may as sume
sev eral bod ies at the same time, how much more ca pa ble of such
feats must the gods be, who nat u rally pos sess all su per nat u ral pow -
ers. A god may di vide him self into many forms and pres ent him self in
many sac ri fices at the same time. He can re main all the while un seen
by oth ers, in con se quence of his power to make him self in vis i ble.

More over, why can not the same god be the ob ject of many sac ri fices,
just as the same man can be the ob ject of sal u ta tion of many per -
sons?

**Sabda iti chet na atah prabhavat
pratyakshanumanabhyam** I.3.28 (91)

If it be said (that a contradiction will result) in respect of the
word (we say) no, because (the world) originates from the word,
as is known from direct perception (Sruti) and inference
(Smriti).

**Sabda:** regarding Vedic words; **Iti:** thus; **Chet** : if; **Na:** no; **Atah:** from
this, from these words; **Prabhavat:** because of the creation;
**Pratyakshanumanabhyam:** from direct perception (Sruti) and
inference (Smriti).

An other ob jec tion against Su tra 26 (with re spect to the cor po re -
al ity of the gods) is raised and re futed.
The Purvapakshin main tains: The Ve dic words have been
proved in the Purvamimamsa phi los o phy to be per ma nent, i.e. with -
out be gin ning or end. Now if gods are said to have bod ies they must
have births and deaths, which all em bod ied be ings are sub ject to.
There fore the Ve dic words for in di vid ual de i ties can not ex ist be fore
their birth, nor can those words sig nify any de i ties, when they have
ceased to ex ist dur ing dis so lu tion. Hence the per ma nency of Ve dic
words fails.
To this ob jec tion the an swer is that there can not be any such in -
con gru ity with re gard to Ve dic words, be cause both Sruti and Smriti
main tain that in di vid ual gods owe their or i gin to Ve dic words.
The Ve dic words ex ist from eter nity. They have got their set tled
mean ing. The Ve dic names for gods sig nify their types and not the in -
di vid u als. There fore the births or deaths of in di vid ual gods can not af -
fect the types, much less the per ma nent char ac ter of Ve dic words.
Cows are in nu mer a ble but it is with the type that the word ‘cow’
is in sep a ra bly con nected. The word ‘cow’ is eter nal. It does not de -
pend on the birth and death of in di vid u als be long ing to that type.
Words rep re sent ing the gods have for their coun ter part ob jects that
are types and not in di vid u als. Indra re fers to a di vine func tion like the
of fice of the Vice roy and who ever is called to that func tion is called
Indra. There fore here is no non-eternality with ref er ence to the Vedas.
The word, in clud ing even the gods, is cre ated from scrip tural
words. The scrip tural words are the source for the world and the gods.
If you ob ject to this and say that this con flicts with the Su tra I-1-2,
which says that Brah man is the cause of the world, we re ply: Brah -
man is the Upadanakarana (ma te rial cause). The Veda is not such

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 3 99
```

ma te rial cause. The cre ator ut ters the Ve dic words and cre ates. He
says earth and cre ates the earth and so on.
The cre ation of ev ery em bod ied be ing, whether Indra or a cow,
pro ceeds from re mem brance of the form and its char ac ter is tics by
Lord Brahma. When he ut ters these words, which by as so ci a tion al -
ways sug gest the par tic u lar form and the char ac ter is tics of that form.
When a spe cial in di vid ual of the class called Indra has per ished, the
cre ator, know ing from the Ve dic word ‘Indra’ which is pres ent in his
mind as the class char ac ter is tics of the be ing de noted by the word,
cre ates an other Indra pos sess ing those very same char ac ter is tics,
just as the pot ter fash ions a new jar on the ba sis of the word ‘jar’ which
is re volv ing in his mind.
Ev ery Ve dic word al ways ex presses a par tic u lar type form and
does not ex press any in di vid ual. Brah man cre ates the world by re -
mem ber ing the par tic u lar type forms de noted by those words. Forms
(Akritis) are eter nal and ex ist in the ar che typal plane from eter nity be -
fore they be come con crete in any in di vid ual form. Brahma, the cre -
ator cre ated the Devas by re flect ing on the word ‘Ete’ (these). He
cre ated the men by the word ‘Asrigram’; the Pitris by the word
‘Indavah’ (drops); the plan ets by the word ‘Tiras pavitram’; the songs
by the word ‘Asuva’; the Mantras by the word ‘Visvani’ and he cre ated
all other crea tures by the word ‘Abhisaubhaga’.
The word ‘etad’ (this) re minds Brahma the cre ator of the Devas
pre sid ing over the senses; the word ‘Asrigra’ mean ing blood, re minds
him of those crea tures in which blood is the chief life-el e ment, namely
men; the word‘Indu’ de not ing moon, re minds him of the fa thers, who
live in the Chandraloka; the word ‘Tiras pavitram’ mean ing ‘hold ing of
the pure am bro sia’ re minds of the plan ets where the Soma fluid ex -
ists; the word ‘Asuva’ (flow ing) re minds him of the sweet flow of mu -
sic; the word ‘Visva’ re minds him of the hymns sa cred to the
Visvedevas; the word ‘Abhisubhaga’, mean ing ‘great pros per ity’, re -
minds him of all crea tures. We read in Bri. Up. “He with his mind
united him self with speech” i.e. the word of the Veda.
Ev ery word has for its coun ter part a form or an ob ject which it
de notes. Name and form are in sep a ra ble. When ever you think of a
form its name co mes be fore your mind at once. When ever you ut ter a
name the ob ject co mes be fore your mind. The re la tion be tween a
name or word and form (the ob ject) is eter nal.
The Veda is not the ma te rial cause of the uni verse. If you say
that the Veda re fers to Vasus, Rudras, Adityas and other gods who
are born and are there fore non-eter nal and, hence, the Vedas also
must be non-eter nal, we re ply that what are born are the in di vid ual
man i fes ta tions of Dravya (sub stance), Guna (qual ity) and Karma (ac -
tions) but not the Akritis, spe cies. The orig i na tion of the uni verse from

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 100
```

the ‘word’ is not to be un der stood in the sense that the word con sti -
tutes the ma te rial cause of the world as Brah man does.
“The sev eral names, ac tions, and con di tions of all things He
shaped in the be gin ning from the words of the Vedas” Manu I-21.
Thought first man i fests as a word and then as the more con crete
form. You can not sep a rate the thought from name and form. If you
wish to do a thing you first re mem ber the word de not ing the thing and
then you start the work. The Ve dic words man i fested in the mind of
Prajapati, the cre ator be fore the cre ation. Af ter that he cre ated the
things cor re spond ing to those words. “Ut ter ing ‘Bhur’ he cre ated the
earth” etc. Taittiriya Brahmana II-2-4-2.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains that the uni verse
can not be born of let ters which are per ish able, that there is an eter nal
Sphota (causal form of sound) of which ut tered sounds are man i fes ta -
tions and that such Sphota is the cause of the uni verse. Sphota is that
which causes the con cep tion of the sense of a word (Arthadhiketu).
Sphota is a supersensuous en tity which is man i fested by the let ters of
the word and if com pre hended by the mind it self man i fests the sense
of the word.
This state ment of the Purvapakshin is re ally un ten a ble. This is
cer tainly not our ac tual ex pe ri ence. The ut tered sounds do not per ish,
for at the end of their ut ter ance we real ise their iden tity when we ut ter
them again. It is said that there might be a dif fer ence of in to na tion
when ut ter ing the same word twice; this does not ne gate the iden tity,
for the dif fer ence is only a dif fer ence of the in stru ment of man i fes ta -
tion. Al beit the let ters are many, their group can be the sub ject of a
con cep tion (e.g. ten, hun dred etc). The Sphota the ory is there fore
quite un nec es sary.
It is there fore quite clear that the Ve dic sounds are eter nal and
that there is no log i cal fal lacy in the doc trine that through them has
been cre ated the en tire uni verse in clud ing the gods.

**AV Ed M {ZË`Ëd_²Ÿ&**

**Ata eva cha nityatvam** I.3.29 (92)
From this very reason also there follows the eternity of the
Vedas.

**Ata eva:** therefore, from this very reason; **Cha:** also; **Nityatvam:** The
eternity of the Vedas.

A side is sue is de duced from Su tra 28.
The eter nal na ture of Ve dic words is also es tab lished from the
same rea sons ad duced in Su tra 28 i.e. be cause those words sig nify
per ma nent types.
This Su tra now con firms the al ready es tab lished eter nity of the
Vedas. The uni verse with its def i nite eter nal types or spheres such as

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 3 101
```

gods and so on orig i nates from the word of the Veda. For this very
rea son the eter nity of the word of the Veda must be ac cepted. As
gods etc., as types are eter nal, the Ve dic words are also eter nal.
The Vedas were not writ ten by any body. They are the very
breath of the Lord. They are eter nal. The Rishis were not the au thors
of the Vedas. They only dis cov ered them. “By means of their past
good deeds the priests were able to un der stand the Vedas. They
found them dwell ing in the Rishis.” The Man tra “By means of sac ri fice
they fol lowed the trace of speech; they found it dwell ing in the Rishis”
in Rigveda Samhita X-71-3 shows that the speech found by the Rishis
was per ma nent. Veda Vyasa also says “For merly the great Rishis,
be ing al lowed to do so by Svayambhu, ob tained through their pen -
ance the Vedas to gether with the Itihasas, which had been hid den at
the end of the Yuga.”

**Samananamarupatvat cha avrittavapyavirodho
darsanat smritescha** I.3.30 (93)

And on account of the sameness of names and forms in every
fresh cycle there is no contradiction (to the eternity of the
words of the Vedas) even in the revolving of the world cycles, as
is seen from the Sruti and Smriti.

**Samananamarupatvat:** on account of similar names and forms;
**Cha:** and; **Avrittau:** in the cycles of creation; **Api:** even, also;
**Avirodhah:** no inconsistency or contradiction; **Darsanat:** from the
Sruti; **Smriteh:** from the Smriti, **Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in fa vour of Su tra 29 is given in this Su tra.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: At the end of a cy cle
ev ery thing is to tally an ni hi lated. There is new cre ation at the be gin -
ning of the next cy cle. There is a break in the con ti nu ity of ex is tence.
Hence even as types, the gods are not eter nal and the eter nal re la tion
of Ve dic words and the ob jects they de note does not re main. Con se -
quently there is con tra dic tion to the eter nity and the au thor ity of the
Vedas.
We say it is not so. Just as a man who rises from sleep con tin -
ues the same form of ex is tence which he en joyed pre vi ously to his
sleep, so also the world is a la tent or po ten tial state (in seed form) in
Pralaya or dis so lu tion; it is again pro jected with all the pre vi ous va ri -
ety of names and forms at the be gin ning of the next cy cle. There fore
the eter nity of the re la tion be tween Ve dic words and their ob jects is
not at all con tra dicted. Con se quently the au thor i ta tive ness of the
Vedas re mains. This is sup ported by Sruti and Smriti. We read in
Rigveda X-190-3 “As for merly the Lord or dered the sun and the
moon, heaven, earth, the sky etc.” We read in the Smriti “As the same

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 102
```

signs of sea sons ap pear again and again in their due course, so do
be ings ap pear and re ap pear in suc ces sive cy cles”.
The word ‘Cha’ in the Su tra is used to re move the doubt raised.
Even af ter a great Pralaya there is no con tra dic tion with re gard to the
eter nity of Ve dic words, be cause the new cre ation pro ceeds on the
same ness of names and forms etc., in the pre ced ing cre ation. In a
Mahapralaya the Vedas and the types de noted by the words of the
Vedas merge in the Lord and be come one with Him. They re main in
Him in a state of la tency. When the Lord de sires to cre ate they come
out from Him again and be come man i fest. The cre ation of in di vid u als
is al ways pre ceded by a re flec tion on the words of the Vedas and the
types de noted by them.
Af ter the Mahapralaya the Lord cre ates the Vedas in ex actly the
same or der and ar range ments as they had been be fore. He re flects
on the words and types and pro jects the whole uni verse. A sub se -
quent cre ation is sim i lar to the past cre ation. The Lord cre ates the
world just as a pot ter who makes a pot by re mem ber ing the word ‘pot’
and the form which the word calls up in his mind.
Af ter a Mahapralaya the Lord Him self cre ates all el e ments from
Mahat down wards up to Brahmanda. He pro jects Brahma from His
body and teaches him the Vedas men tally (not orally) and en trusts
him with the work of fur ther cre ation. In mi nor Pralaya Brahma does
not cease to ex ist, nor do the el e ments. Brahma him self cre ates the
world af ter ev ery mi nor Pralaya.
It may be ob jected that when we sleep and then wake up we can
re call the al ready ex pe ri enced ex ter nal uni verse and that such a thing
is not pos si ble in the case of the dis so lu tion of the world. But our an -
swer is that by the grace of the Su preme Lord, Hiranyagarbha or
Brahma can rec ol lect the state of the world as it was be fore the dis so -
lu tion. We read in the Svetasvatara Upanishad “Dur ing Pralaya all
forms van ish but Sakti re mains. The next cre ation takes place
through it alone”. Oth er wise you would have to pos tu late a cre ation
out of noth ing.

**Madhu adishu:** in Madhu Vidya etc.; **Asambhavat:** on account of the
impossibility; **Anadhikaram:** disqualification; **Jaiminih:** Jaimini is of

An other ob jec tion to Su tra 26 is raised.
```
```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 3 103
```

For Madhu Vidya vide Chh. Up. III-1-11, the sage Jaimini, the
au thor of Purvamimamsa, says that as the sun and the other gods are
the de i ties to be wor shipped in Madhu Vidya and the like, it is im pos si -
ble that they should also be the wor ship pers. Hence they are not en ti -
tled for the Upasana pre scribed in Sruti, be cause ob vi ously they
can not wor ship them selves. In Madhu Vidya one is to med i tate on the
Sun as honey (ben e fi cial). Such a med i ta tion is not pos si ble for Surya
or the Sun-god be cause one and the same per son can not be both the
ob ject of med i ta tion as well as the per son med i tat ing.
Fur ther the Devas like Vasu etc., al ready be long to the class of
Vasus etc. There fore in their case the med i ta tion is use less as the fruit
is al ready ac com plished. The Devas have noth ing to gain by such
med i ta tion. So they have no de sire for this med i ta tion, be cause they
al ready are in pos ses sion of that which is the fruit of such med i ta tion.

**Á`mo{V{f ^mdmƒŸ&**

**Jyotishi bhavaccha** I.3.32 (95)
And (the gods are not qualified for Vidyas) because (the words
‘sun, moon’ etc., spoken of as gods) are used in the sense of
mere spheres of light.

**Jyotishi:** as mere spheres of light; **Bhavat:** because used in the
sense; **Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in sup port of the ob jec tion raised in Su tra 31 is
given.
The Purvapakshin raises an other ob jec tion: The lu mi nous orbs
can not pos si bly do acts of med i ta tion. Such and other lu mi nary ob -
jects as Agni etc., can not have a bodily form with hands, heart or in tel -
li gence. They are ma te rial in ert ob jects. They can not have wishes.
We can not place faith on Itihasas and Puranas, as they are of hu man
or i gin and as they them selves stand in need of other means of knowl -
edge on which to base. The Mantras do not form an in de pend ent
means of au thor i ta tive knowl edge. The Arthavada pas sages can not
be re garded to con sti tute by them selves rea sons for the ex is tence of
the per son al ity of the gods. Con se quently the gods are not qual i fied
for any kind of Vidya or knowl edge of Brah man.

**^md§ Vw ~mXam`Umo@pñV {hŸ&**

**Bhavam tu Baadarayano’sti hi** I.3.33 (96)
But Baadarayana, on the other hand (maintains) the existence
(of qualification on the part of the gods for Brahma Vidya); for
there are (passages indicatory of that; body, desires etc., which
qualify one for such knowledge do exist in the case of the gods).

**Bhavam:** the existence (of the qualification to practise the meditation
like Madhu Vidya etc.); **Tu:** but; **Baadarayanah:** the sage
Baadarayana (maintains); **Asti:** does exist; **Hi** : because.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 104
```

This Su tra re futes the ar gu ments in the pre vi ous two Sutras and
con cludes the dis cus sion.
But Baadarayana holds that the gods too have the right to prac -
tise Upasana as med i ta tion and Brahma Vidya, be cause there are in -
di ca tions in Sruti to that ef fect. He main tains that each lu mi nary orb
has a pre sid ing de ity with body, in tel li gence, de sires etc. The gods
can as sume any form at will. Indra as sumed the form of a ram and
car ried off Medhatithi. Surya as sumed the form of a man and came to
Kunti. We read in Chh. Up. VIII-12-6 “The gods in deed do wor ship the
At man.” The sun-god may be dis qual i fied for a par tic u lar form of med -
i ta tion—Madhu Vidya, as he can not med i tate on the sun him self, but
that is no rea son why he should be dis qual i fied for other med i ta tions
or for Brahma Vidya or the knowl edge of Brah man. Sim i lar is the case
with other gods.
The ex pres sion ‘Tu’ (but, on the other hand) is meant to re but
the Purvapakshin.
Scrip ture de clares that the Devas are qual i fied. “What ever Deva
was awak ened so to know Brah man he in deed be came that” Bri. Up.
1-4-10. Indra went to Prajapati say ing “well, let us search for that Self
by which if one has searched it out, all worlds and all de sires are ob -
tained” Chh. Up. VIII-7.
The de scrip tion of the forms of gods is real. How can un real
forms of gods be con ceived by our minds for our of fer ing sac ri fices to
them? Or di nary peo ple are not able to be hold their forms. But sages
like Vyasa have seen them. They spoke to the gods. The Yoga Sutras
say “By Svadhyaya one can be in com mu nion with the de ity which we
wor ship.” How can you deny the pow ers of Yoga? Rishis had mar vel -
lous pow ers.
There fore gods have forms and are el i gi ble for Brahma Vidya.

CHAPTER I—SECTION 3 105
```

The dis cus sion on the priv i lege of di vine med i ta tion be gun in
Su tra 25 is con tin ued.
The whole of this Adhikarana about Sudras to gether with the
pre ced ing one about the Devas ap pears to be an in ter po la tion of
some later au thor.
In the pre vi ous Su tra it has been shown that the gods are en ti -
tled to the study of Vedas and Brahma Vidya. This Su tra dis cusses
whether the Sudras are en ti tled to them or not.
The Purvapakshin says: The Sudras also have got bod ies and
de sires. Hence they are also en ti tled. Raikva re fers to Janasruti who
wishes to learn from him by the name of Sudra. “Fie, neck lace and
car riage be thine, O Sudra, to gether with the cows” Chh. Up. IV-2 & 3.
But when he ap pears a sec ond time, Raikva ac cepts his pres ents and
teaches him. Smriti speaks of Vidura and oth ers who were born from
Sudra moth ers as pos sess ing high est knowl edge. There fore the
Sudra has a claim to Brahma Vidya or knowl edge of Brah man.
This Su tra re futes the view and de nies the right to the study of
the Vedas for Sudra. The word ‘Sudra’ does not de note a Sudra by
birth which is its con ven tional mean ing, be cause Janasruti was a
Kshatriya king. Here we will have to take the et y mo log i cal mean ing of
the word which is, “He rushed into grief ( _Sukam abhi dudrava_ ) or as
“grief rushed on him” or as “he in his grief rushed to Raikva”. The fol -

**Kshatriyatvavagateschottaratra chaitrarathena lingat** I.3.35 (98)

And because the Kshatriyahood (of Janasruti) is known from
the inferential mark (supplied by his being mentioned) later on
with Chaitraratha (who was a Kshatriya himself).

**Kshatriyatva:** the state of his being a Kshatriya; **Avagateh:** on
account of being known or understood; **Cha:** and; **Uttaratra:** latter on
in a subsequent part of the text; **Chaitrarathena:** with Chaitraratha;
**Lingat:** because of the indicatory sign or the inferential mark.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 34 is given.
Janasruti is men tioned with the Kshatriya Chaitraratha
Abhipratarin in con nec tion with the same Vidya. Hence we can in fer
that Janasruti also was a Kshatriya be cause, as a rule, equals are
men tioned to gether with equals. Hence the Sudras are not qual i fied
for the knowl edge of Brah man.

**g§ñH$manam_em©V² VX^mdm{^bmnmƒŸ&**

**Samskaraparamarsat tadabhavabhilapaccha** (I.3.36) (99)

Because purificatory ceremonies are mentioned (in the case of
the twice-born) and their absence is declared (in the case of the
Sudra).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 106
```

**Samskara:** the purificatory ceremonies, the investiture with sacred

thread; **Paramarsat:** because of the reference; **Tat:** that ceremony;

**Abhava:** absence; **Abhilapat:** because of the declaration; **Cha:** and.

The dis cus sion on the priv i lege of Brahma Vidya on the part of
Sudras is con tin ued.
In dif fer ent places of the Vidyas the Upanayana cer e mony is re -
ferred to. The Upanayana cer e mony is de clared by the scrip tures to
be a nec es sary con di tion for the study of all kinds of knowl edge or
Vidya. We read in Prasna Up. I-1 “De voted to Brah man, firm in Brah -
man, seek ing for the high est Brah man they, car ry ing fuel in their
hands, ap proached the ven er a ble Pippalada, think ing that he would
teach them all that.” Upanayana cer e mony is meant for the higher
castes. With ref er ence to the Sudras on the other hand, the ab sence
of cer e mo nies is fre quently men tioned in the scrip tures. “In the Sudra
there is not any sin by eat ing pro hib ited food, and he is not fit for any
cer e mony” Manu X-12-6. A Sudra by birth can not have Upanayana
and other Samskaras with out which the Vedas can not be stud ied.
Hence the Sudras are not en ti tled to the study of the Vedas.
The next Su tra fur ther strength ens the view that a Sudra can
have no Samskara.

**VX^md{ZYm©aUo M àd¥Îmo...Ÿ&**

**Tadabhavanirdharane cha pravritteh** I.3.37 (100)

And because the inclination (on the part of Gautama to impart

Sudrahood (in Jabala Satyakama).

**Tad:** that, namely the Sudrahood; **Abhava:** absence; **Nirdharane:** in

ascertainment; **Cha:** and; **Pravritteh:** from inclination.

The same dis cus sion on the Sudras’ right is con tin ued.
Gautama, hav ing as cer tained Jabala not to be a Sudra from his

**Sravana:** hearing; **Adhyayana:** studying; **Artha:** understanding;

**Pratishedhat:** on account of the prohibition; **Smriteh:** in the Smriti;

The same dis cus sion on the Sudras’ right is con cluded here.
The Smriti pro hib its their hear ing the Veda, their study ing and
un der stand ing the Veda and their per form ing Ve dic rites. “The ears of
him who hears the Veda are to be filled with mol ten lead and lac.” For
a Sudra is like a cem e tery. There fore the Veda is not to be read in the
vi cin ity of a Sudra. “His tongue is to be slit if he pro nounces it; his body
is to be cut through if he pre serves it.” Sudras like Vidura and the re li -
gious hunter Dharma Vyadha ac quired knowl edge ow ing to the af ter
ef fects of for mer deeds in past births. It is pos si ble for the Sudras to
at tain that knowl edge through the Puranas, Gita and the ep ics,
Ramayana and Mahabharata which con tain the quin tes sence of the
Vedas.
It is a set tled point that the Sudras do not pos sess any such
qual i fi ca tion with re gard to the Veda.

Kampanadhikaranam: Topic 10
The Prana in which everything trembles is Brahman
```
**H$ånZmV²Ÿ&**

**Kampanat** I.3.39 (102)

(Prana is Brahman) on account of the vibration or trembling
(spoken of the whole world).

**Kampanat:** on account of shaking or vibration.

Af ter dis cuss ing the side is sues in Su tra 25-38 the Sutrakara or
the au thor of the Sutras re sumes the ex am i na tion of the main is sue.
An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is given here.
The dis cus sion of qual i fi ca tion for Brahma Vidya or knowl edge
of Brah man is over. We re turn to our chief topic i.e., the en quiry into
the pur port of the Vedanta texts.
We read in Kathopanishad II-3-2 “What ever there is in the whole
world has come out of Prana and trem bles in the Prana. The Prana is
a great ter ror, a raised thun der bolt. Those who know it be come im -
mor tal.”
The Purvapakshin main tains that the term Prana de notes the air
or the vi tal force with its five mod i fi ca tions. The Siddhantin says: Here
Prana is Brah man and not the vi tal force, be cause Brah man only is
spo ken of in the pre ced ing as well as in the sub se quent part of the
chap ter. How then can it be sup posed that all at once the vi tal force
should be re ferred to in the in ter me di ate part?

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 108
```

“The whole world trem bles in Prana.” We find here a qual ity of
Brah man viz., its con sti tut ing the abode of the whole world. That the
word ‘Prana’ de notes the high est Self ap pears from such pas sages
as ‘the Prana of Prana’ Bri. Up. IV-4-18. The scrip ture de clares “No
mor tal lives by the Prana and the breath that goes down. We live by
an other in whom these two re pose” (Katha Up. II-5-5). In the pas sage
sub se quent to the one un der dis cus sion “From ter ror of it fire burns,
from ter ror the sun shines, from ter ror Indra and Vayu and Death as
the fifth run away.” Brah man and not the vi tal force is spo ken of as the
sub ject of that pas sage, which is rep re sented as the cause of fear on
the part of the en tire uni verse in clu sive of the Prana it self. Brah man
only is the cause of the life of the en tire uni verse in clud ing the vi tal
force.
Brah man is com pared to a thun der bolt be cause he in spires fear
in fire, air, sun, Indra and Yama. Fur ther Im mor tal ity is de clared to him
who knows this Prana. “A man who knows him only passes over
death, there is no other path to go.” (Svet. Up. VI-15). Prana is also of -
ten used to de note Brah man in the Sruti.

Jyotiradhikaranam: Topic 1 1
The ‘light’ is Brahman

**Á`mo{VX©e©ZmV²Ÿ&**

**Jyotirdarsanat** I.3.40 (103)

The light (is Brahman) on account of that (Brahman) being
seen (in the scriptural passage).

**Jyotih:** light; **Darsanat:** on account of (Brahman) being seen.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is con tin ued.
We read in the Sruti “Thus does that se rene be ing aris ing from
this body, ap pear in its own form as soon as it has ap proached the
High est Light” (Chh. Up. VIII-12-3).
Here the doubt arises whether the word ‘light’ de notes the phys -
i cal light which is the ob ject of sight and dis pels dark ness, or the High -
est Brah man.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: The word light de notes
the well-known phys i cal light be cause that is the con ven tional sense
of the word.
To this we have the fol low ing re ply. The word ‘light’ can de note
the High est Brah man only. Why? Be cause in the whole chap ter Brah -
man is the topic of dis cus sion. The High est Light is also called the
‘High est Per son’ in that text it self later on. Free dom from body is said
to be long to that be ing which is one with this light. Sruti de clares
“When he is free from the body then nei ther plea sure nor pain
touches him” (Chh. Up. VIII-12.1). Free dom from body is not pos si ble

Arthantaratvadivyapadesadhikaranam: Topic 12
The Akasa is Brahman

**AmH$memo@Wm©ÝVaËdm{Xì`nXoemV²Ÿ&**

**Akaso’rthantaratvadivyapadesat** I.3.41 (104)
Akasa (is Brahman) because it is declared to be something
different etc., (from names and forms).

**Akasah:** Akasa; **Arthantaratvadi-vyapadesat:** because it is
declared to be something different; **Artha:** with a meaning;
**Antaratva:** differentness. **Adi:** etc.; **Vyapadesat:** from statement on
account of designation.

An other ex pres sion from the Chhandogya Upanishad is now
taken up for dis cus sion. We read in Chhandogya Upanishad VIII-14-1
“That which is called Akasa is the revealer of all names and forms.

That within which these names and forms are con tained is Brah man,
the Im mor tal, the Self.”
Here a doubt arises whether that which here is called Akasa is
the High est Brah man or the or di nary el e men tal ether.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor says that Akasa means here
the el e men tal ether, be cause this is the con ven tional mean ing of the
word.
To this the Siddhantin gives the fol low ing re ply. Here ‘Akasa’ is
Brah man only, be cause it is des ig nated as a dif fer ent thing etc.
Names and forms are said to be within this Akasa, which is there fore

dif fer ent from these.
The term Akasa sig ni fies Brah man be cause it is stated to be the
source of all names and forms, also be cause it is qual i fied by such ep -
i thets as ‘In fi nite’ ‘Im mor tal’ ‘Self’. The word Akasa, re fers to Brah man
be cause the de scrip tion “be yond name and form” ap plies only to
Brah man.

```

An ex pres sion from the sixth chap ter of the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad is now taken up for dis cus sion.
In the sixth Prapathaka or chap ter of the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad, in re ply to the ques tion—“Who is that Self?” (IV-3-7), a
lengthy ex po si tion of the na ture of the Self is given. “He who is within
the heart, among the Pranas, the per son of light, con sist ing of knowl -
edge”.
Here a doubt arises whether the Self is the High est Self or the
in di vid ual soul.
The Su tra de clares that it is the High est Self. Why? Be cause it is
shown to be dif fer ent from the in di vid ual soul in the state of deep
sleep and at the time of death. “This per son em braced by the High est
in tel li gent Self knows noth ing that is with out or within” Bri. Up.
IV-3-21. This clearly in di cates that in deep sleep the ‘per son’ or the in -
di vid ual soul is dif fer ent from the High est in tel li gent Self or Brah man.
Here the term “the per son” must mean the Jiva or the em bod ied
soul, be cause the ab sence of the knowl edge of what is within and
with out in deep sleep can be pred i cated only of the in di vid ual soul.
The Su preme in tel li gent Self is Brah man be cause such in tel li gence
can be pred i cated of Brah man only. Brah man is never dis so ci ated
from all-em brac ing knowl edge. Sim i larly the pas sage that treats of
de par ture i.e. death (this bodily Self mounted by the in tel li gent self
moves along groan ing) re fers to the Su preme Lord as dif fer ent from
the in di vid ual soul. The Jiva who casts off this mor tal body is dif fer ent
from Su preme Self or Brah man. The Jiva alone passes through the
stages of sound-sleep and death. Brah man has nei ther sleep nor
death. He is wide awake al ways.
There fore Brah man is the chief topic in this Sec tion. The Chap -
ter ex clu sively aims at de scrib ing the na ture of Brah man. The lengthy
dis course on the in di vid ual soul in this Sec tion is to show that he is in
es sence iden ti cal with Brah man.

INTRODUCTION
```
In Topic 5, Sec tion 1, it has been shown that as the Pradhana of
the Sankhyas is not based on the au thor ity of the scrip tures and that
as all the Sruti texts re fer to an in tel li gent prin ci ple as the first cause,
Brah man is the first cause.
The na ture of Brah man has been de fined in I.1.2. It has been
shown that the pur port of all Vedanta texts is to set forth the doc trine
that Brah man and not the Pradhana, is the cause of the world.
The Sankhyas say that it has not been sat is fac to rily proved that
there is no scrip tural au thor ity for the Pradhana, be cause some
Sakhas con tain ex pres sion which seem to con vey the idea of the
Pradhana.
This Pada or Sec tion pro ceeds to deal with the con sid er ation of
other Ve dic texts which are as serted by the Sankhyas to de clare that
the Pradhana is the cause of the uni verse.
The whole of Sec tion 4 gives suit able and co gent an swers to all
ob jec tions raised by the Sankhyas.

**SYNOPSIS**
The fourth Pada or Sec tion of the first Chap ter is spe cially di -
rected against the Sankhyas. This Sec tion ex am ines some pas sages
from the Upanishads where terms oc cur which may be mis taken for
the names of the in sen tient mat ter of Sankhyas. It de clares au thor i ta -
tively that the Vedanta texts lend no sup port what so ever to the
Sankhya the ory of cre ation or the doc trine of Pradhana. This Sec tion
proves that Brah man is the ma te rial as well as the ef fi cient cause of
the uni verse.
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-7) dis cusses the pas sage in Katha
Upanishad I-3-10, 11 where men tion is made of the great (Mahat) and
the un de vel oped (Avyaktam). Avyakta is a syn onym for Pradhana in
the Sankhya Sastra. ‘Mahat’ means in tel lect in Sankhya phi los o phy.
Sri Sankaracharya shows that the term Avyakta de notes the sub tle
body or Sukshma Sarira as well as the gross body also and the term
Mahat Brah man or the Su preme Self.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Sutras 8-10) shows that ac cord ing to Sankara
the tri-col oured ‘Aja’ spo ken of in the Svetasvatara Upanishad IV.5 is
not the Pradhana of the Sankhyas but ei ther that power of the Lord
from which the world takes its or i gin or the pri mary causal mat ter first
pro duced by that power.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 11-13) shows that the
‘Pancha-pancha-janah’ men tioned in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
IV-4-17 are not the twenty-five prin ci ples of the Sankhyas.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Sutras 14-15) shows that al though there is con -
flict as re gards the or der of cre ation, scrip ture does not con tra dict it -
self on the all-im por tant point of Brah man i.e., a Be ing whose
es sence is in tel li gence, which is the cause of this uni verse.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 16-18) proves that “He who is the maker
of those per sons, of whom this is the work” men tioned in Kau. Up.
IV-1-19 is not ei ther the Prana (the vi tal air) or the in di vid ual soul, but
Brah man.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 19-22) de cides that the “Self to be seen,
to be heard” etc. (Bri. Up. II-4-5) is the Su preme Self, but not the in di -
vid ual soul. The views of Jaimini, Asmarathya, Audulomi and
Kasakritsna are ex pressed.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 23-27) teaches that Brah man is not only
the ef fi cient or op er a tive cause (Nimitta) of the world, but its ma te rial
cause as well. The world springs from Brah man by way of mod i fi ca -
tion (Parinama Su tra 26).

```
114
```

_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Su tra 28) shows that the ref u ta tion of the
Sankhya views is ap pli ca ble to other the o ries also such as the atomic
the ory which says that the world has orig i nated from at oms, etc.

Anumanikadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-7)
The Mahat and Avyakta of the Kathopanishad

Anumanikamapyekeshamiti chet na
sarirarupakavinyastagrihiter darsayati cha** I.4.1 (107)
If it be said that in some (recensions of the Vedas) that which is
inferred (i.e. the Pradhana) (is) also (mentioned), (we say) no,
because (the word ‘Avyakta’ occurring in the Katha
Upanishad) is mentioned in a simile referred to the body (and
means the body itself and not the Pradhana of the (Sankhyas);
(the Sruti) also explains (it).

**Anumanikam:** that which is inferred (i.e., the Pradhana); **Api:** also;
**Ekesham:** of some branches or school of Srutis or recensions of the
text; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** No; **Sarirarupakavinyastagrihiteh:**
because it is mentioned in a simile referring to the body ( **Sarira:** body,
**Rupaka:** simile, **Vinyasta:** contained, **Grihiteh:** because of the
reference); **Darsayati:** (the Srutis) explain; **Cha:** also, too, and.

The Sankhyas again raise an ob jec tion. They say that the
Pradhana is also based on scrip tural au thor ity, be cause some
Sakhas like the Katha Sakha (school) con tain ex pres sions wherein
the Pradhana seems to be re ferred to “Be yond the Mahat there is the
Avyakta (the unmanifested or the un de vel oped), be yond the Avyakta
is the Purusha (Be ing or Per son)” Katha Up. 1-3-11.
The Sankhyas say that the word ‘Avyakta’ here re fers to the
Pradhana be cause the words ‘Mahat’, ‘Avyakta’ and ‘Purusha’ which
oc cur in the same or der in the Sankhya phi los o phy, oc cur in the Sruti
text. Hence they are re cog nised to be the same cat e go ries of the
Sankhyas. The Pradhana is called ‘un de vel oped’ be cause it is des ti -
tute of sound and other qual i ties. It can not there fore be said that there
is no scrip tural au thor ity for the Pradhana. We de clare that this
Pradhana is the cause of the world on the strength of Sruti, Smriti and
ra ti o ci na tion.

This Su tra re futes it thus. The word ‘Avyakta’ does not re fer to
the Pradhana. It is used in con nec tion with a sim ile re fer ring to the
body. The im me di ately pre ced ing part of the Chap ter ex hib its the sim -
ile in which the Self, the body, and so on, are com pared to the Lord of
a char iot, a char i o teer etc. “Know the soul to be the Lord of the char -
iot, the body to be the char iot, the in tel lect the char i o teer and the mind
the reins. The senses they call the horses, the ob jects of the senses
their roads. When the Self is in un ion with the body, the senses and
the mind, then wise peo ple call him the enjoyer” Katha Up. I.3.3-4.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 116
```

All these things that are re ferred to in these verses are found in
the fol low ing: “Be yond the senses there are the ob jects, be yond the
ob jects there is mind, be yond the mind there is the in tel lect, the great
Self (Mahat) is be yond the in tel lect. Be yond the great (Mahat) is the
Avyakta (the un de vel oped), be yond the Avyakta there is the Purusha.
Be yond the Purusha there is noth ing—this is the goal, the high est
path” Katha Up. I.3.10-11.
Now com pare these two quo ta tions. In this pas sage we re cog -
nise the senses etc. which in the pre ced ing sim ile had been com -
pared to horses and so on. The senses, the in tel lect and the mind are
re ferred to in both pas sages un der the same names. The ob jects in
the sec ond pas sage are the ob jects which are in the for mer pas sage
des ig nated as the roads of the senses. The Mahat of the later text
means the cos mic in tel lect. In the ear lier pas sage in tel lect is the char -
i o teer. It in cludes the in di vid ual and cos mic in tel lect. The At man of the
ear lier text cor re sponds to the Purusha of the later text and body of
the ear lier text cor re sponds to Avyakta in the later text. There fore
Avyakta means the body here and not the Pradhana. There re mains
now the body only which had be fore been com pared to the char iot in
the ear lier text.
Now an ob jec tion is raised. How can the body which is man i fest,
gross and vis i ble (Vyakta) be said to be unmanifest and un evolved?
The fol low ing Su tra gives a suit able an swer.

**gyú_§ Vw VXh©ËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Sukshmam tu tadarhatvat** I.4.2 (108)

But the subtle (body is meant by the term Avyakta) on account
of its capability (of being so designated).

**Sukshmam:** the subtle, the permanent atoms, the causal body; **Tu:**
but; **Tad arhatvat:** because it can be properly so termed.

An ob jec tion to Su tra 1 is re futed.
The Su tra re plies that what the term ‘Avyakta’ de notes is the
sub tle causal body. Any thing sub tle may be spo ken of as ‘un de vel -
oped’ or ‘unmanifested’. The sub tle parts of the el e ments, the causal
sub stance, i.e., the five un com pounded el e ments out of which the
body is formed may be called so. As they are sub tle and not man i fest,
and as they also tran scend sense per cep tion, they can be prop erly
des ig nated by the term ‘Avyakta’.
It is also a mat ter of com mon oc cur rence to de note the ef fect by
the cause. There fore the gross body is re ferred to here in di rectly.
Com pare for in stance the phrase “Mix the Soma with the cow (i.e.,
milk)” Rigveda IX.40.4. An other scrip tural pas sage also de clares
“Now all this, i.e., this de vel oped world with names and forms is ca pa -
ble of be ing des ig nated ‘un de vel oped’ in so far as in a pre vi ous state it

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 4 117

was in a merely sem i nal or po ten tial state des ti tute of names and
forms”.
In Brihadaranyaka Upanishad I-4-7, the Ka ra na Sarira is called
by the term un evolved or Avyakta. Be fore the world came into man i -
fes ta tion it was in the form of a seed or causal body.
An ob jec tion is raised. If the Avyakta is taken to be mat ter in its
sub tle state con sist ing of the causal body, what ob jec tion is there to
in ter pret it as the Pradhana of the Sankhya sys tem, be cause there
also Avyakta means mat ter in sub tle state. The fol low ing Su tra gives
a suit able an swer to this ob jec tion.

**VXYrZËdmXW©dV²Ÿ&**

**Tadadhinatvat arthavat** I.4.3 (109)

On account of its dependence (on the Lord, such a previous
seminal condition of the world may be admitted, because such
an admission is) reasonable.

**Tad:** its; **Adhinatvat:** on account of dependence; **Arthavat:** having a
sense or a meaning subserving an end or purpose; is fitting.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
The op po nent says. If a suit able causal state of the gross world
is ad mit ted it is as good as ac cept ing the Pradhana, for we Sankhyas
un der stand by the term Pradhana, noth ing but the an te ced ent con di -
tion of the uni verse.
The Siddhantin gives the fol low ing re ply. The Pradhana of the
Sankhyas is an in de pend ent en tity. The sub tle causal state ad mit ted
here is de pend ent on the High est Lord. A pre vi ous sub tle stage of the
uni verse must nec es sar ily be ad mit ted. It is quite rea son able. For
with out it the Lord can not cre ate. It is the po ten tial power of Brah man.
The whole Lila is kept up through this power. He could not be come
ac tive if he were des ti tute of this po ten tial power. It is the causal po -
ten ti al ity in her ent in Brah man. That causal po ten ti al ity is of the na ture
of ne science.
The ex is tence of such a causal po ten ti al ity ren ders it pos si ble
that the Jivanmuktas or lib er ated souls do not take fur ther birth as it is
de stroyed by per fect knowl edge. It is rightly de noted by the term ‘un -
de vel oped’ (Avyakta). It has the Su preme Lord for its sub stra tum. It is
of the na ture of an il lu sion. It is Anirvachaniya or in de scrib able. You
can nei ther say that it is nor that it is not.
This un de vel oped prin ci ple is some times de noted by the term
‘Akasa’, ether. “In that Im per ish able then, O Gargi, the ether is wo ven
like warp and woof” Bri. Up. III-8-11. Some times, again, it is de noted
by the term Akshara, the Im per ish able. “Higher than the high, Im per -
ish able” Mun. Up. II-1-2.

Just as the il lu sion of a snake in a rope is not pos si ble merely
through ig no rance with out the sub stra tum—rope, so also the world
can not be cre ated merely by ig no rance with out the sub stra tum, the
Lord. There fore the sub tle causal con di tion is de pend ent on the Lord,
and yet the Lord is not in the least af fected by this ig no rance, just as
the snake is not af fected by the poi son. “Know that the Prakriti is
Maya and the great Lord the ruler of Maya” Svet. Up. IV-10.
So the Avyakta is a helper (Sahakari) to the Lord in His cre ation.
The Lord cre ates the uni verse us ing it as a means. It is de pend ent on
the Lord. It is not like the Pradhana of the Sankhyas which is an in de -
pend ent en tity.
The Lord looks on Maya and energises her. Then she has the
power of pro duc ing the world. In her own na ture she is Jada or in sen -
tient.
In the next Su tra the au thor gives an other rea son for hold ing
that the ‘Avyakta’ of the Katha Upanishad is not to be in ter preted as
Pradhana.

**ko`ËdmdMZmƒŸ&**

**Jneyatvavachanaccha** I.4.4 (110)
And because it is not mentioned (that the Avyakta) is to be
known (it cannot be the Pradhana of the Sankhyas).

**Jneyatva:** that is the object to be known; **Avachanat:** because of
non-mention; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
Ac cord ing to the Sankhyas, eman ci pa tion re sults when the dif -
fer ence be tween the Purusha and the Avyakta (Prakriti) is known. For
with out a knowl edge of the na ture of the con sti tu tive el e ments of
Pradhana it is im pos si ble to re cog nise the dif fer ence of the soul from
them. Hence the Avyakta is to be known ac cord ing to the Sankhyas.
But here there is no ques tion of know ing the Avyakta. Hence it can not
be the Pradhana of the Sankhyas.
It is im pos si ble to hold that knowl edge of things which is not
taught in the text is of any use to man. For this rea son also we hold
that the word ‘Avyakta’ can not de note the Pradhana.
The Sankhyas call Avyakta or Pradhana the first cause. But the
first cause has been stated in the Sruti as the ob ject to be known. In
the Sruti ‘Avyakta’ is not stated to be an ob ject of pur suit. Hence it is
not the first cause and con se quently, can not be mis taken for the mat -
ter of Sankhyas.
Ac cord ing to the Sankhyas, lib er a tion is at tained by know ing
that Purusha is dif fer ent from Prakriti. The knowl edge of Prakriti is
thus an es sen tial of re lease. But the Katha Upanishad no where men -
tions that the knowl edge of ‘Avyakta’ is nec es sary for the fi nal eman -
ci pa tion. There fore the Avyakta of the Katha Upanishad is not the
Prakriti of the Sankhyas.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 4 119
```

No where does the scrip ture de clare that Pradhana (Mat ter) is
Jneya (to be known) or Upasya (to be wor shipped). What is aimed at
as the ob ject of knowl edge of ad o ra tion in the Srutis is the Su preme
seat of Vishnu ( _Tad Vishnoh paramam padam_ ).

**dXVr{V MoÞ àmkmo {h àH$aUmV² &**

**Vadatiti chet na prajno hi prakaranat** I.4.5 ( 11 1)
And if you maintain that the text does speak (of the Pradhana
as an object of knowledge) we deny that; because the
intelligent (supreme) Self is meant on account of the general
subject matter.

**Vadati:** the verse or the text states; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if. **Na:** no;
**Prajnah:** the intellect supreme; **Hi:** because; **Prakaranat:** from the
context, because of the general subject-matter of the Chapter.

An ob jec tion to Su tra 4 is raised and re futed.
The Sruti says, “He who has per ceived that which is with out
sound, with out touch, with out form, de cay, with out taste, eter nal, with -
out smell, with out be gin ning, with out end, be yond the great (Mahat)
and un change able, is freed from the jaws of death” Katha Up. II-3-15.
The Sankhyas says that the Pradhana has to be known to at tain
the fi nal re lease, be cause the de scrip tion given of the en tity to be

known agrees with the Pradhana, which is also be yond the Mahat
(great). Hence we con clude that the Pradhana is de noted by the term
‘Avyaktam’.
This Su tra re futes this. It says that by Avyakta, the one be yond
Mahat (great) etc., the in tel li gent Su preme Self is meant, as that is the
sub ject-mat ter of that Sec tion.
Fur ther the high est Self is spo ken of in all Vedantic texts as pos -
sess ing just those qual i ties which are men tioned in the pas sage
quoted above viz., ab sence of sound etc.
Hence it fol lows that the Pradhana in the text is nei ther spo ken

of as the ob ject of knowl edge nor de noted by the term ‘Avyaktam’.
Even the propounders of the Sankhya phi los o phy do not state
that lib er a tion or re lease from death is the re sult of the knowl edge of
Pradhana. They state that it is due to the knowl edge of the sen tient
Purusha.
The au thor gives an other rea son for hold ing that Pradhana is
not meant in the pas sage of the Katha Upanishad.

**Ì`mUm_od M¡d_wnÝ`mg... àíZüŸ&**

**Trayanameva chaivamupanyasah prasnascha** I.4.6 (112)
And there is question and explanation relating to three things
only (not to the Pradhana).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 120
```

**Trayanam:** of the three, namely three boons asked by Nachiketas;
**Eva:** only; **Cha:** and; **Evam:** thus; **Upanyasah:** mentioned,

(presentation by way of answer); **Prasnat:** question; **Cha:** and.

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 5 is fur ther re futed.
In the Katha Upanishad Nachiketas asks Yama three ques tions
only viz., about the fire sac ri fice, the in di vid ual soul and the Su preme
Self. These three things only Yama ex plains and to them only the
ques tions of Nachiketas re fer. Pradhana is not men tioned. Noth ing
else is men tioned or en quired about. There is no ques tion rel a tive to
the Pradhana and hence no scope for any re marks on it. We can not
ex pect Yama to speak of the Pradhana which has not been en quired
into. So Pradhana has no place in the dis course.

**_hÛƒŸ&**

**Mahadvaccha** I.4.7 (113)

And (the case of the term Avyakta) is like that of the term
Mahat.

**Mahadvat:** like the Mahat; **Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is given. Just as in the case of
Mahat, Avyakta also is used in the Vedas in a sense dif fer ent from that
at tached to it in the Sankhya.
The Sankhyas use the term ‘Mahat’ (the great one) to de note
the first born en tity, the in tel lect. The term has a dif fer ent mean ing in
the Ve dic texts. In the Ve dic texts it is con nected with the word Self.
Thus we see in such pas sages as the fol low ing—“The great Self is
be yond the in tel lect” (Katha Up. I-3-10), “The great Om ni pres ent Self”
(Katha Up. I-2-22), “I know the great per son” (Svet. Up. III-8). We
there fore, con clude that the term ‘Avyakta’ also where it oc curs in the
Srutis, can not de note the Pradhana. Though the Avyakta may mean
the Pradhana or Prakriti in the Sankhya phi los o phy, it means some -
thing dif fer ent in the Sruti texts. So the Pradhana is not based on
scrip tural au thor ity, but is a mere con clu sion of in fer ence.
Mahat is the Buddhi of the Sankhyas. But in the Katha
Upanishad the Mahat is said to be higher than Buddhi. “ _Buddheratma
mahan parah_ .” So the Mahat of the Kathopanishad is dif fer ent from
the Mahat of the Sankhyas.

The Aja of Svetasvatara Upanishad does not mean Pradhana
```
**M_gdX{deofmV² &**

**Chamasavadaviseshat** I.4.8 (114)

(It cannot be maintained that ‘Aja’ means the Pradhana)
because no special characteristic is stated, as in the case of the
cup.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 4 121
```

**Chamasavat:** like a cup; **Aviseshat:** because there is no special

characteristic.

An ex pres sion from the Svetasvatara Upanishad is now taken
up for dis cus sion in sup port of Su tra 1.
The au thor next re futes an other wrong in ter pre ta tion given by
the Sankhyas of a verse from the Svetasvatara Upanishad.
We find in the Svetasvatara Upanishad IV-5, “There is one ‘Aja’
red, white and black in col our, pro duc ing man i fold off spring of the
same na ture.”
Here a doubt arises whether this ‘Aja’ re fers to the Pradhana of
the Sankhyas or to the sub tle el e ments fire, wa ter, earth. The
Sankhyas main tain that ‘Aja’ here means the Pradhana, the un born.
The words red, white and black re fer to its three con stit u ents, the
Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. She is called ‘un born’. She is not
an ef fect. She is said to pro duce man i fold off spring by her own un -
aided ef fort.
This Su tra re futes this. The Man tra taken by it self is not able to
give as ser tion what the Sankhya doc trine is meant. There is no ba sis
for such a spe cial as ser tion in the ab sence of spe cial char ac ter is tics.
The case is anal o gous to that of the cup men tioned in the Man tra,
“There is a cup hav ing its mouth be low and its bot tom above” Bri. Up.
II-2-3. It is im pos si ble to de cide from the text it self what kind of cup is
meant. Sim i larly it is not pos si ble to fix the mean ing of ‘Aja’ from the
text alone.
But in con nec tion with the Man tra about the cup we have a sup -
ple men tary pas sage from which we learn what kind of cup is meant.
“What is called the cup hav ing its mouth be low and its bot tom above is
the skull.” Sim i larly, here we have to re fer this pas sage to sup ple men -
tary texts to fix the mean ing of Aja. We should not as sert that it means
the Pradhana.
Where can we learn what spe cial be ing is meant by the word
‘Aja’ of the Svetasvatara Upanishad? To this ques tion the fol low ing
Su tra gives a suit able an swer.

**Á`mo{VénH«$_m Vw VWm øYr`V EHo$Ÿ&**

**Jyotirupakrama tu tatha hyadhiyata eke** I.4.9 (115)

But (the elements) beginning with light (are meant by the term
Aja), because some read so in their text.

**Jyotirupakrama:** elements beginning with light; **Tu:** but; **Tatha:** thus;

**Hi:** because; **Adhiyate:** some read, some recensions have a reading;

**Eke:** some.

This is ex plan a tory to Su tra 8.
By the term ‘Aja’ we have to un der stand the causal mat ter from
which fire, wa ter and earth have sprung. The mat ter be gins with light

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 122
```

i.e., com prises fire, wa ter and earth. The word ‘tu’ (but) gives em pha -
sis to the as ser tion. One Sakha as signs to them red col our etc. “The
red col our is the col our of fire, white col our is the col our of wa ter, black
col our is the col our of earth” Chh. Up. VI-2-4, 4-1.
This pas sage fixes the mean ing of the word ‘Aja’. It re fers to fire,
earth and wa ter from which the world has been cre ated. It is not the
Pradhana of the Sankhyas which con sists of the three Gunas. The
words red, white, black pri mar ily de note spe cial colours. They can be
ap plied to the three Gunas of the Sankhyas in a sec ond ary sense
only. When doubt ful pas sages have to be in ter preted, the pas sages
whose sense is be yond doubt are to be used. This is gen er ally a re -
cog nised rule.
In the Svetasvatara Upanishad in Chap ter I we find that Aja is
used along with the word “ _Devatma Sakti_ —the di vine power.” There -
fore Aja does not mean Pradhana.
The cre ative power is Brah man’s in her ent en ergy, which em a -
nates from Him dur ing the pe riod of cre ation. Prakriti her self is born of
Brah man. There fore Aja in its lit eral sense of ‘un born’ can not ap ply to
Prakriti or Pradhana. Lord Krishna says, “ _Mama yonir mahad
Brahma_ —My womb is the great Brah man, in that I place the germ
thence com eth forth the birth of all be ings, O Bharata.” This shows
that Prakriti her self is pro duced from the Lord.

**H$ënZmonXoemƒ _Üdm{XdX{damoY...Ÿ&**

**Kalpanopadesaccha madhvadivadavirodhah** I.4.10 (116)

And on account of the statement of the assumption (of a
metaphor) there is nothing contrary to reason (in Aja denoting
the causal matter) as in the case of honey (denoting the sun in
Madhu Vidya for the sake of meditation) and similar cases.

**Kalpana:** the creative power of thought; **Upadesat:** from teaching;
**Cha:** and; **Madhvadivat:** as in the case of honey etc.; **Avirodhah:** no
incongruity.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 8 is con tin ued.
The Purvapakshin says, “The term Aja de notes some thing un -
born. How can it re fer to the three causal el e ments of the
Chhandogya Upanishad, which are some thing cre ated? This is con -
trary to rea son.”
The Su tra says: There is no in con gru ity. The source of all be ings
viz., fire, wa ter and earth is com pared to a she-goat by way of met a -
phor. Some she-goat might be partly red, partly white and partly
black. She might have many young goats re sem bling her in col our.
Some he-goat might love her and lie by her side, while some other
he-goat might aban don her af ter hav ing en joyed her. Sim i larly the uni -
ver sal causal mat ter which is tri-col oured on ac count of its com pris ing
fire, wa ter and earth pro duces many in an i mate and an i mate be ings

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 4 123
```

like unto it self and is en joyed by the souls who are bound by Avidya or
ig no rance, while it is re nounced by those souls who have at tained
true knowl edge of the Brah man.
The words ‘like honey’ in the Su tra mean that just as the sun al -
though not be ing honey is rep re sented as honey (Chh. Up. III.1), and
speech as cow (Bri. Up. V-8), and the heav enly world etc., as the fires
(Bri. Up. VI-2.9). So here the causal mat ter though not be ing a tri-col -
oured she-goat, is met a phor i cally or fig u ra tively rep re sented as one.
Hence there is noth ing in con gru ous in us ing the term ‘Aja’ to de note
the ag gre gate of fire, wa ter and earth. ‘Aja’ does not mean ‘un born’.
The de scrip tion of Na ture as an Aja is an imag i na tive way of teach ing
a Truth. The sun is the honey of the gods, though the sun is not mere
honey.

Sankhyopasangrahadhikaranam: Topic 3
The five-fold-five (Pancha-panchajanah) does not
refer to the twenty-five Sankhyan categories

**Z g§»`mong§J«hmX{n ZmZm^mdmX{VaoH$mƒŸ&**

**Na sankhyopasangrahadapi nanabhavadatirekaccha** I.4. 1 1 (117)

Even from the statement of the number (five-fold-five i.e.,
twenty-five categories by the Sruti it is) not (to be understood
that the Sruti refers to the Pradhana) on account of the
differences (in the categories and the excess over the number
of the Sankhyan categories).

**Na:** not; **Sankhya:** number; **Upasangrahat:** from statement; **Api:**
even; **Nanabhavat:** on account of the differences; **Atirekat:** on
account of excess; **Cha:** and.

This Su tra dis cusses whether the twenty-five prin ci ples of the
Sankhyan phi los o phy are ad mit ted by the Sruti.
The Sankhya or Purvapakshin failed in his at tempt to base his
doc trine on the text which speaks of the ‘Aja’. He again co mes for -
ward and points to an other text. “He in whom the five groups of five
and the ether rest, Him alone I be lieve to be the Self; I who know be -
lieve Him to be Brah man” (Bri. Up. IV-4-17). Now five-times-five
makes twenty-five. This is ex actly the num ber of the Sankhya Tattvas
or prin ci ples. The doc trine of Pradhana rests on a scrip tural ba sis.
Here is the scrip tural au thor ity for our phi los o phy.
This Su tra re futes such an as sump tion. Panchapanchajanah,
five-five-peo ple can not de note the twenty-five cat e go ries of the
Sankhyas. The Sankhya cat e go ries have each their in di vid ual dif fer -
ence. There are no at trib utes in com mon to each pentad. The
Sankhya cat e go ries can not be di vided into groups of five of any ba sis
of sim i lar ity, be cause all the twenty-five prin ci ples or Tattvas dif fer
from each other.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 124
```

This is fur ther not pos si ble ‘on ac count of the ex cess’. The ether
is men tioned as a sep a rate cat e gory. This will make the num ber
twenty-six in all. This is not in ac cor dance with the the ory of the
Sankhyas.
From the mere enu mer a tion of the num ber 25 we can not say
that the ref er ence is to the twenty-five Sankhya cat e go ries and that
hence the Sankhya doc trine has the sanc tion of the Vedas.
The pas sage re fers to At man also. Then the to tal num ber will be
twenty-seven. At man is de scribed as the ba sis of the oth ers. There -
fore it can not be one of the twenty-five prin ci ples.
The prin ci ples of Sankhya phi los o phy are pro pounded as in de -
pend ent of Purusha. But here the cat e go ries are known to be en tirely
de pend ent on Brah man or At man who is said to be the main stay of
them all. So they can not be ac cepted as the in de pend ent prin ci ples of
Sankhya.
The word Panchajanah is a group de not ing term. It is the spe cial
name be long ing to all the mem bers of that group. The group con sists
of five mem bers, each of whom is called a Panchajanah. There fore
the phrase ‘Pancha-panchajanah’ does not mean five times five be -
ings but five be ings. Ev ery one of whom is called a Panchajanah. It is
just like the phrase Saptarshi, which de notes the con stel la tion Ursa
Ma jor, con sist ing of seven stars. The word Saptarshi is a spe cial
name of ev ery one of these stars. When we say seven Saptarshis we
do not mean seven times-seven stars but seven stars each one of
whom is called a Saptarshi. There fore ‘Pancha-panchajanah’ does
not mean five times five prod ucts, but five peo ple ev ery one of whom
is called a Panchajanah. The twenty-five Tattvas of the Sankhyas are
these: 1, Prakriti; 2-8, seven mod i fi ca tions of Prakriti viz., Mahat etc.,
which are causal sub stances, as well as ef fects; 9-24 six teen ef fects;
the 25 is the soul which is nei ther a causal sub stance nor an ef fect.
Who then are these be ings called Panchajanah? The fol low ing
Su tra gives the re ply.

**àmUmX`mo dmŠ`eofmV² &**

**Pranadayo vakyaseshat** I.4.12 (118)
(The Panchajanah or the five people referred to are) the vital
force etc., (as is seen) from the complementary passage.

**Pranadayah:** the Prana and the rest; **Vakyaseshat:** because of the
complementary passage.

The Su tra is ex plan a tory to Su tra 11.
The text in which the Panchajanah are men tioned is fol lowed by
an other one in which the vi tal force and four other things are men -
tioned in or der to de scribe the na ture of Brah man. “They who know
the Prana of Prana (the breath of breath), the eye of the eye, the ear

```

of the ear, the food of the food, the mind of mind etc.” (Bri. Madhya.
IV-4-21).
The five peo ple re fer to the Prana and the other four of the text
and are men tioned for the pur pose of de scrib ing the na ture of Brah -
man.
The Sankhya asks how can the word ‘peo ple’ be ap plied to the
breath, the eye, the ear and so on? How we ask in re turn, can it be ap -
plied to your cat e go ries? In both cases the com mon mean ing of the
term ‘peo ple’ is ap plied to the Pranas in the text, “These are the five
per sons of Brah man” (Chh. Up. III-13-6). “Breath is fa ther, breath is
mother” (Chh. Up. VII-15-1).
The ob jec tor says. This is pos si ble only in the recension of the
Madhyandinas, who read the ad di tional word ‘Annasya Annam’. But
in Kanva recension that phrase ‘annasya annam’ is omit ted. We have
only four. This ob jec tion is an swered by the au thor in the fol low ing Su -
tra.

**Á`mo{Vf¡Ho$fm_gË`ÞoŸ&**

**Jyotishaikeshamasatyanne** I.4.13 (119)

In the text of some (the Kanva recension) where food is not
mentioned (the number five is made up) by ‘light’ (mentioned
in the previous verse).

**Jyotisha:** by light; **Ekesham:** of some texts or recensions, i.e., of the
Kanvas; **Asati:** in the absence of; **Anne:** food.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 11 is con tin ued.
“The im mor tal light of lights the gods wor ship as lon gev ity” Bri.
Up. IV-4-10. Al though food is not men tioned in the text cited in the last
Su tra, ac cord ing to the Kanva recension of the Satapatha Brahmana,
yet the four of that verse, to gether with ‘light’ men tioned in the text
quoted above, would make the five peo ple.
We have proved here with that scrip tures of fer no ba sis for the
doc trine of the Pradhana. It will be shown later on that this doc trine
can not be proved ei ther by Smriti or by ra ti o ci na tion.

**Karanatvena chakasadishu yathavyapadishtokteh** I.4.14 (120)
Although there is a conflict of the Vedanta texts as regards the
things created such as ether and so on, there is no such
conflict with respect to Brahman as the First Cause, on
account of His being represented in one text as described in
other texts.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 126
```

**Karanatvena:** as the (First) cause; **Cha:** and; **Akasadishu:** with

reference to Akasa and the rest; **Yatha:** as; **Vyapadishta:** taught in

different Srutis; **Ukteh:** because of the statement.

The doubt that may arise from Su tra 13 that dif fer ent Srutis may
draw dif fer ent con clu sions as to the cause of the uni verse is re moved
by this Su tra.
In the pre ced ing part of the work the proper def i ni tion of Brah -
man has been given. It has been shown that all the Vedanta texts
have Brah man for their com mon topic. It has been proved also that
there is no scrip tural au thor ity for the doc trine of the Pradhana. But
now the Sankhya raises a new ob jec tion.
He says: It is not pos si ble to prove ei ther that Brah man is the
cause of the or i gin etc., of the uni verse or that all the Vedanta texts re -
fer to Brah man; be cause the Vedanta pas sages con tra dict one an -
other. All the Vedanta texts speak of the suc ces sive steps of the
cre ation in dif fer ent or der. In re al ity they speak of dif fer ent cre ations.
Thus in Tait. Up. II-1-1 we find that cre ation pro ceeds from Self or
Brah man “From the Self sprang Akasa, from Akasa air” etc. This pas -
sage shows that the cause of cre ation is At man. In an other place it is
said that the cre ation be gan with fire (Chh. Up. VI-2-3). In an other
place, again, it is said “The per son cre ated breath and from breath
faith” (Pras. Up. IV-4); in an other place, again, that the Self cre ated
these worlds, the wa ter above the heaven, light, the mor tal (earth)
and the wa ter be low the earth (Aitareya Aranyaka II-4-1-2, 3). There
no or der is stated at all. Some where it is said that the cre ation orig i -
nated from the non-ex is tent (Asat). “In the be gin ning there was the
non-ex is tent (Asat); from it was born what ex ists” (Tait. Up. II-7). “In
the be gin ning there was the non-ex is tent; it be came ex is tent; it grew”
(Chh. Up. III-19-1). In an other place it is said “Oth ers say, in the be gin -
ning there was that only which is not; but how could it be thus, my
dear? How could that which is to be born of that which is not” (Chh.
Up. VI-2-1, 2).
In an other place Sat is said to be the cause of the uni verse “Sat
alone was in the be gin ning” Chh. Up. VI-2-1. In an other place, again,
the cre ation of the world is spo ken of as hav ing taken place spon ta ne -
ously. Again we find that Avyakta is said to be the cause of the world
“Now all this was then Avyakrita (un de vel oped). It be came de vel oped
by name and form” Bri. Up. 1-4-7. Thus the Upanishads are not con -
sis tent, as re gards the cause of the uni verse. Thus it is not pos si ble to
as cer tain that Brah man alone is taught in the Upanishads as the
cause of the world. As many dis crep an cies are ob served, the
Vedanta texts can not be ac cepted as au thor i ties for de ter min ing the
cause of the uni verse. We must ac cept some other cause of the world
rest ing on the au thor ity of Sruti and rea son ing.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 4 127
```

It is pos si ble to say that Pradhana alone is taught to be the
cause of the world as we find from the pas sage of the Bri. Up. al ready
quoted above. Fur ther the words Sat, Asat, Prana, Akasa and
Avyakrita can very well be ap plied to Pradhana, be cause some of
them such as Akasa, Prana are the ef fects of Pradhana, while oth ers
are the names of Pradhana it self. All these terms can not be ap plied to
Brah man.
In some pas sages we find that At man and Brah man are also
said to be the cause of the world; but these two terms can be ap plied
to Pradhana also. The lit eral mean ing of the word ‘At man’ is all-per -
vad ing. Pradhana is all-per vad ing. Brah man lit er ally means that
which is pre-em i nently great (Brihat). Pradhana may be called Brah -
man also. Pradhana is called Asat in its as pect of mod i fied things and
it is called Sat or be ing in its causal or eter nal as pect. Pradhana is
called Prana as it is an el e ment pro duced from it. Think ing etc., may
also ap ply to Pradhana in a met a phor i cal sense, mean ing the com -
mence ment of ac tion. So when the Upanishad says “It thought, let me
be come many”, it means, that Pradhana started the ac tion of mul ti pli -
ca tion. There fore all the Upanishad pas sages re lat ing to cre ation har -
mo nise better with the the ory of Pradhana be ing the cre ator than of
Brah man.
The Siddhantin gives the fol low ing re ply. Al though the Vedanta
texts may be con flict ing with re gard to the or der of the things cre ated
such as ether and so on, yet they uni formly de clare that Brah man is
the First Cause. The Vedantic pas sages which are con cerned with
set ting forth the cause of the world are in har mony through out. It can -
not be said that the con flict of state ments re gard ing the uni verse af -
fects the state ments re gard ing the cause i.e., Brah man. It is not the
main ob ject of the Vedanta texts to teach about cre ation. There fore it
would not even mat ter greatly. The chief pur pose of the Srutis is to
teach that Brah man is the First Cause. There is no con flict re gard ing
this.
The teacher will rec on cile later on these con flict ing pas sages
also which re fer to the uni verse.

Non-existence)

**Samakarshat:** from its connection with a distant expression.

Some texts from the Taittiriya, the Chhandogya and

The Sankhyas raise an other ob jec tion. They say: There is a

that the Self cre ated these worlds (Ait. Ar. II-4-1-2-3). Some Vedanta
pas sages de clare that cre ation orig i nated from non-ex is tence (Tait.
II-7). Again in some pas sages ex is tence is taught as the First Cause
(Chh. Up. VI-1-2). Some Srutis speak of spon ta ne ous cre ation. It can -
not be said that the Srutis re fer to Brah man uni formly as the First
Cause ow ing to the con flict ing state ments of the Vedanta texts.
The Siddhantin gives the fol low ing re ply. We read in the Tait. Up.
II-7 “This was in deed non-ex is tence in the be gin ning.” Non-ex is tence
here does not mean ab so lute non-ex is tence. It means un dif fer en ti -
ated ex is tence. In the be gin ning ex is tence was un dif fer en ti ated into
name and form. Taittriya Upanishad says “He who knows Brah man
as non-ex ist ing be comes him self non-ex ist ing. He who knows Brah -
man as ex ist ing, him we know him self as ex ist ing” Tait. Up. II-6. It is
fur ther elab o rated by means of the se ries of sheaths viz., the sheath
of food etc. rep re sented as the in ner self of ev ery thing. This same
Brah man is again re ferred to in the clause. He wished ‘May I be
many’. This clearly in ti mates that Brah man cre ated the whole uni -
verse.
The term ‘Be ing’ or di narily de notes that which is dif fer en ti ated
by names and forms. The term ‘Non-be ing’ de notes the same sub -
stance pre vi ous to its dif fer en ti a tion. Brah man is called ‘Non-be ing’
pre vi ously to the orig i na tion of the world in a sec ond ary sense.
We read in Chh. Up. VI-2-2 “How can that which is cre ated from
non-ex is tence be?” This clearly de nies such a pos si bil ity.
“Now this was then un de vel oped” (Bri. Up. I-4-7) does not by
any means as sert that the evo lu tion of the world took place with out a
ruler, be cause it is con nected with an other pas sage where it is said,
“He has en tered here to the very tips of the fin ger-nails” (Bri. Up.
I-4-7). ‘He’ re fers to the Ruler. There fore we have to take that the
Lord, the Ruler, de vel oped what was un de vel oped.
An other scrip tural text also de scribes that the evo lu tion of the
world took place un der the su per in ten dence of a Ruler. “Let me now
en ter these be ings with this lov ing Self, and let me then evolve names
and forms” Chh. Up. VI-3-2.
Al though there is a reaper it is said “The corn-field reaps it self.”
It is said also “The vil lage is be ing ap proached.” Here we have to sup -
ply “by Devadatta or some body else.”
Brah man is de scribed in one place as ex is tence. In an other
place it is de scribed as the Self of all. There fore it is a set tled con clu -
sion that all Vedanta texts uni formly point to Brah man as the First
Cause. Cer tainly there is no con flict on this point.
Even in the pas sage that de clares Asat i.e. non-be ing to be the
cause there is a ref er ence to Sat i.e. Be ing. Even the text that de -
scribes Asat as the Causal force ends by re fer ring to Sat.

The doubt about the mean ing of a word or pas sage can be re -
moved by ref er ence to its con nec tion with a dis tant pas sage in the
same text, for such con nec tion is found to ex ist in the dif fer ent pas -
sages of Sruti. The ex act mean ing of such words as ‘Asat’ which
means non-en tity, ap par ently, ‘Avyakrita’ which means ap par ently
non-man i fest Pradhana of Sankhya, is thus as cer tained to be Brah -

man. Com pare the Srutis: gmo@H$m_`V ~hþñ`m§àOm`o`o{V “He de sired, I will be

many I will man i fest my self” Tait. Up. II-6-2. AgÛm BX_J« AmgrV² “This was at
first Asat”—ap par ently a non-en tity. Tait. II-7-1. The mean ing of the
word Asat of the sec ond pas sage is as cer tained to be Brah man by
ref er ence to the first pas sage where the same ques tion namely the

state of the uni verse be fore cre ation is an swered in a clearer way.
The mean ing of the word Avyakrita in the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad I-4-7 in the pas sage VÛoX§ Vø©ì`mH¥$V_mgrV² & (thus there fore, that
was the un dif fer en ti ated) is as cer tained to be the Brah man as still un -
de vel oped by a ref er ence to the pas sage g Ef Bh à{dï> AmZImJ«oä`... (the same
is per vad ing all through and through down to the tips of the nails of the
fin gers and toes). Avyakta is re cog nised in the last pas sage more
clearly by the words ‘Sa esha’ (the self-same one).
The Pradhana of the Sankhyas does not find a place any where
in the pas sages which treat about the cause of the world. The words
‘Asat’ ‘Avyakrita’ also de note Brah man only.
The word ‘Asat’ re fers to Brah man which is the sub ject un der
dis cus sion in the pre vi ous verse. Be fore the cre ation, the dis tinc tion
of names and forms did not ex ist. Brah man also then did not ex ist in
the sense that He was not con nected with names and forms. As he
has then no name and form, he is said to be Asat or non-ex is tent.
The word ‘Asat’ can not mean mat ter or non-be ing, be cause in
this very pas sage we find that the de scrip tion given of it can ap ply
only to Brah man.
Brah man is not ‘Asat’ in the lit eral mean ing of that word. The
seer of the Upanishad uses it in a sense to tally dis tinct from its or di -
nary de no ta tion.

BRAHMA SUTRAS 130

A pas sage from the Kaushitaki Upanishad is now taken up for
dis cus sion.
In the Kaushitaki Brahmana the sage Balaki prom ises to teach
Brah man by say ing “I shall tell you Brah man”, and he goes on to de -
scribe six teen things as Brah man, be gin ning with the Sun. All these
are set aside by the King Ajatasatru who says, none of them is Brah -
man. When Balaki is si lenced, Ajatasatru gives the teach ing about
Brah man in these words: “O Balaki! He who is the maker of those per -
sons whom you men tioned and whose work is the vis i ble uni -
verse—is alone to be known.”
We read in the Kaushitaki Upanishad in the di a logue be tween
Balaki and Ajatasatru “O Balaki, He who is the maker of those per -
sons whom you men tioned, and whose work is this (vis i ble uni verse)
is alone to be known” (Kau. Up. IV-19).
A doubt arises now whether what is here said as the ob ject of
knowl edge is the in di vid ual soul or the Prana or Brah man, the Su -
preme Self. The Purvapakshin holds that the vi tal force or Prana is
meant, be cause he says the clause “of whom this is the work” points
to the ac tiv ity of mo tion and that ac tiv ity rests on Prana. Sec ondly, we
meet with the term ‘Prana’ in a com ple men tary pas sage. “Then he be -
comes one with the Prana alone” Kau. Up. IV-20. The word ‘Prana’
de notes the vi tal force. This is well known. Thirdly, Prana is the maker
of all the per sons, the per son in the Sun, the per son in the moon etc.
We know from an other scrip tural text that the Sun and other de i ties
are only dif fer en ti a tions of Prana, “Who is that one God in whom all
other gods are con tained? Prana and he is Brah man, and they call
him That” (Bri. Up. III-9-9).
Or the pas sage re fers to the in di vid ual soul as the ob ject of
knowl edge. A sub se quent pas sage con tains an in fer en tial mark of the
in di vid ual soul, “As the mas ter feeds with his peo ple, nay as his peo -
ple feed on the mas ter, thus does this con scious Self feed with the
other selfs” Kau. Up. IV-20. As the in di vid ual soul is the sup port of the
Prana, it may it self be called Prana. We thus con clude that the pas -
sage un der dis cus sion re fers ei ther to the in di vid ual soul or to the
chief Prana but not to the Lord of whom it does not con tain any in fer -
en tial marks what so ever.
The Su tra re futes all these and says it is Brah man that is re -
ferred to the maker in the text; be cause Brah man is taught here “I
shall teach you Brah man.” Again ‘this’ which means the world, is his
‘work.’ This clearly points out that the ‘he’ is Brah man only.
The ref er ence in the Kaushitaki Brahmana pas sage is to the Su -
preme Lord be cause of the ref er ence to the world. The ac tiv ity re -
ferred to is the world of which the Lord is the Cre ator.

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 4 131
```

There fore the maker is nei ther Prana nor the in di vid ual soul, but
the High est Lord. It is af firmed in all Vedanta texts that the Maker of
the world is the Su preme Lord.

If it be said that on account of the inferential marks of the
individual soul and the chief Prana (Brahman is) not (referred
to by the word ‘matter’ in the passage quoted), (we reply) that
has already been explained.

**Jiva:** the individual soul; **Mukhyaprana:** the chief vital air; **Lingat:**
because of the inferential marks; **Na iti:** not thus; **Chet:** if; **Tat:** that;
**Yyakhyatam:** has already been explained.

An ob jec tion to Su tra 16 is raised and re futed. The ob jec tion has
al ready been dis posed of un der I-1-31.
In the Su tra I-1-31 which dealt with the topic of the di a logue be -
tween Indra and Pratardana, this ob jec tion was raised and an swered.
All those ar gu ments would ap ply here also. It was shown there that
when a text is in ter preted as re fer ring to Brah man on the ground of a
com pre hen sive sur vey of its ini tial and con clud ing clauses, all other
in fer en tial marks which point to other top ics, such as Jiva or Prana
etc., must be so in ter preted that they may be in har mony with the
main topic.
Here also the ini tial clause re fers to Brah man in the sen tence
“Shall I tell you Brah man?” The con clud ing clause is “Hav ing over -
come all evils, he ob tains pre-em i nence among all be ings, sov er -
eignty and su prem acy, yea, he who knows this”. Thus the ini tial and
con clud ing clauses here also re fer to Brah man. If in the mid dle of this
text we find any mark from which Jiva or any other topic may be in -
ferred, we must so in ter pret the pas sage as to re fer to Brah man, in or -
der to avoid con tra dic tion.
This topic is not re dun dant as it is al ready taught in Su tra I-1-31,
be cause the chief point dis cussed here is the word ‘Karma’ which is li -
a ble to mis in ter pre ta tion. There fore this Adhikarana cer tainly teaches
some thing new.
The word Prana oc curs in the sense of Brah man in the pas sage
“The mind set tles down on Prana” Chh. Up. VI-8-2.

**Anyartham:** for another purpose; **Tu:** but; **Jaiminih:** Jaimini;
**Prasna-vyakhyanabhyam:** from the question and the reply; **Api:**
also; **Cha:** and; **Evam:** in this way; **Eke:** others, other Srutis.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 16 is given.
Even the ref er ence to the in di vid ual soul has a dif fer ent pur pose
i.e. aims at in ti mat ing Brah man.
Af ter Ajatasatru has taught Balaki by wak ing the sleep ing man,
that the soul is dif fer ent from the Prana or the vi tal air, he asks the fol -
low ing ques tion: “Balaki, where did the per son here sleep? Where
was he? Whence came he thus back?” Kau. Up. IV. 19. These ques -
tions clearly re fer to some thing dif fer ent from the in di vid ual soul. And
so like wise does the an swer (Kau. Up. IV.20) say that the in di vid ual
soul is merged in Brah man in deep sleep.
When sleep ing he sees no dream, then he be comes one with
that Prana alone, and ‘from that Self all Pranas pro ceed, each to -
wards its place, from the Pranas the gods, from the gods the worlds”.
This con ver sa tion oc curs in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. It
clearly re fers to the in di vid ual soul by means of the term “the per son
con sist ing of cog ni tion” (Vijnanamaya) and dis tin guishes from it the
High est Self. “Where was then the per son con sist ing of cog ni tion?
and from whence did he thus come back?” (Bri. Up. II-1-16) and later
on, in the re ply to the above ques tion, de clares that ‘the per son con -
sist ing of cog ni tion lies in the ether within the heart’. We al ready know
that the word ‘ether’ de notes the su preme seat for in stance in the pas -
sage above the “small ether within the lo tus of the heart” (Chh. Up.
VIII-1-1).

A pas sage from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is now taken up
for dis cus sion.
From the syn thetic study of the con text it is clear that the ref er -
ence is to the Su preme Self.
We read in the Maitreyi-Brahmana of the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad the fol low ing pas sage: “Ver ily a hus band is not dear that
you may love the hus band etc., but that you may love the Self, there -
fore ev ery thing is dear. Ver ily the Self is to be seen, to be heard, to be

```
CHAPTER I—SECTION 4 133
```

re flected and to be med i tated upon, O Maitreyi! When the Self has
been seen, heard, re flected and real ised or known, then all this is
known” Bri. Up. IV-5-6.
Here a doubt arises whether that which is rep re sented as the
ob ject to be seen, to be heard and so on is the in di vid ual soul or the
Su preme Self.
The Purvapakshin says: The Self is by the men tion of dear
things such as hus band and so on, in di cated as the enjoyer. From this
it ap pears that the text re fers to the in di vid ual soul.
This Su tra re futes this and says that in this pas sage the high est
Self is re ferred to, and not the in di vid ual soul. In the whole Sec tion
Brah man is treated. Maitreyi says to her hus band Yajnavalkya: “What
should I do with the wealth by which I do not be come im mor tal? What
my Lord knoweth tell that to me.” There upon Yajnavalkya ex pounds
to her the knowl edge of the Self. Scrip ture and Smriti de clare that im -
mor tal ity can be at tained only by the knowl edge of the Su preme Self.
Then Yajnavalkya teaches her the knowl edge of the Self. Fi nally the
Sec tion con cludes with “Thus far goes im mor tal ity.”
Im mor tal ity can not be at tained by the knowl edge of the in di vid -
ual soul, but only by the knowl edge of the High est Self or Brah man.
There fore Brah man alone is the sub ject mat ter of the pas sage un der
dis cus sion. Brah man alone is to be seen or real ised through hear ing,
re flec tion and med i ta tion.
Yajnavalkya de clares that the Self is the cen tre of the whole
world with the ob jects, the senses and the mind, that it has nei ther in -
side nor out side, that it is al to gether a mass of knowl edge. It fol lows
from all this that what the text rep re sents as the ob ject of sight and so
on is the Su preme Self.
Fur ther it is said in the text that by the knowl edge of the Self ev -
ery thing is known. This clearly in ti mates that the Self is Brah man only
be cause how can the knowl edge of fi nite Jiva or in di vid ual soul give
us knowl edge of ev ery thing?

**Pratijnasiddherlingamasmarathyah** I.4.20 (126)
(The fact that the individual soul is taught as the object of

proposition; so Asmarathya thinks.

**Pratijnasiddheh:** because of the proof of the proposition; **Lingam:**
indicatory mark; **Asmarathyah:** the sage Asmarathya.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 19 is given. The in di ca tion is
that the in di vid ual soul is not dif fer ent from Brah man, the Ul ti mate
Cause, of which it is a ray. Hence to know Brah man, the Cause, is to
know all that.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 134
```

If the in di vid ual were quite dif fer ent from Brah man, then by the
knowl edge of Brah man ev ery thing else would not be known. The ini -
tial state ment aims at rep re sent ing the in di vid ual soul or Jiva and the
Su preme Self as non-dif fer ent for the pur pose of ful fill ing the prom ise
made. The non-dif fer ence be tween Brah man and the in di vid ual soul
es tab lishes the prop o si tion, “When the Self is known all this is
known”, “All this is that Self”.
Asmarathya is of opin ion that the pas sages ‘ _Atmani vijnate
sarvamidam vijnatam bhavati_ ’ and ‘ _Idam sarvam yadayamatma_ ’
prove the as pect of iden tity of the in di vid ual soul and the Su preme
Self, be cause only then can be at tained what is prom ised i.e., that by
the knowl edge of Brah man ev ery thing can be at tained. I-4-20.
The sparks that pro ceed from a fire are not ab so lutely dif fer ent
from the fire as they are of the na ture of the fire. They are not ab so -
lutely non-dif fer ent from the fire, be cause in that case they could be

in di vid ual souls also, which are the ef fects of Brah man, are nei ther
ab so lutely dif fer ent from Brah man, be cause that would mean that
they are not of the na ture of in tel li gence; nor ab so lutely non-dif fer ent
from Brah man, be cause in that case they could not be dis tin guished
from each other; and be cause if they were iden ti cal with Brah man,
and there fore Om ni scient, it would be use less to give them any in -
struc tion. There fore the in di vid ual souls are some how dif fer ent from
Brah man and some how non-dif fer ent. This doc trine of Asmarathya is

Asmarathya.

**Utkramishyata evambhavadityaudulomih** I.4.21 (127)

Jiva or the in di vid ual soul which is as so ci ated with its dif fer ent

free and has no body-con scious ness, it real ises that it is iden ti cal with
Brah man. There fore it is rep re sented as non-dif fer ent from the Su -
preme Self. This is the opin ion of the teacher Audulomi.
We read in the Srutis also “that se rene be ing aris ing from this

est Light” Chh. Up. VIII-12-3. Mundakopanishad says “As the flow ing
rivers van ish in the sea, hav ing lost their name and form, so also the
sage, freed from name and form, goes to the Di vine Per son who is
greater than the great” Mun. Up. III-2-8.
The in di vid ual soul is ab so lutely dif fer ent from the Su preme
Self. It is con di tioned by the dif fer ent lim it ing ad juncts viz., body,
senses, mind and in tel lect. But it is spo ken of in the Upanishads as
non-dif fer ent from the Su preme Self be cause it may pass out of the
body and be come one with the Su preme Self, af ter hav ing pu ri fied it -
self by means of med i ta tion and knowl edge. The text of the
Upanishad thus trans fers a fu ture state of non-dif fer ence to that time
when dif fer ence ac tu ally ex ists. This doc trine ad vo cated by
Audulomi—which holds that dif fer ence be tween the in di vid ual soul

**Avasthiteriti Kasakritsnah** I.4.22 (128)

(The initial statement is made) because (the Supreme Self)
exists in the condition (of the individual soul); so the Sage
Kasakritsna thinks.

**Avasthiteh:** because of the existence; **Iti:** thus (holds);
**Kasakritsnah:** the sage Kasakritsna.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 19 is con tin ued.
The in di vid ual soul or Jiva is quite dif fer ent in na ture from Brah -
man or the Su preme Self. It is not pos si ble for the in di vid ual soul to be
one with Brah man in the state of eman ci pa tion. There fore the teacher
Kasakritsna thinks that the High est Self It self ex ists as the in di vid ual
soul. As the Su preme Self ex ists also in the con di tion of the in di vid ual
soul, the Sage Kasakritsna is of opin ion that the ini tial state ment
which aims at in ti mat ing the non-dif fer ence of the two is pos si ble.
Brah man or the Su preme Self and the in di vid ual soul are ab so -
lutely non-dif fer ent. The ap par ent dif fer ence is due to Upadhis or lim -
it ing ve hi cles or ad juncts which are only prod ucts of Avidya or
ig no rance. The dif fer ence is il lu sory or un real from the ab so lute or
tran scen den tal view point. There fore it fol lows that ev ery thing else is
known by the knowl edge of the Self or Brahmajnana.
That the Su preme Self only is that which ap pears as the in di vid -
ual soul is ob vi ous from the Brahmana-pas sage “Let me en ter into
them with this liv ing Self and evolve names and forms.”
Su tra 20 means that, the af fir ma tion that “by know ing It ev ery -
thing is known”, shows the in di vid ual soul and the Su preme Self are
non-dif fer ent. Su tra 21 means the iden tity of the soul and the Su -
preme Self, re fers to the state of at tain ment of the Su preme Self by
the pu ri fied and per fected soul. Su tra 22 means that even now the

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 136
```

Su preme Self is the in di vid ual soul. It is not that the in di vid ual soul is
dis solved or merged in the Su preme Self. Our er ro ne ous sense of di -
ver sity and sep a rate ness is lost or dis solved but the soul, which is in
re al ity the Su preme Self (or the one At man which alone ex ists), ex ists
for ever.
Of these three opin ions, the one held by Kasakritsna is in ac cor -
dance with the Scrip ture, be cause it agrees with what all the Vedanta
texts teach.
Ac cord ing to the state ment of Asmarathya, the soul is not ab so -
lutely dif fer ent from the Su preme Self. His dec la ra tion in di cates by the
ex pres sion “Ow ing to the ful fil ment of the prom ise”, that there is a cer -
tain re la tion of cause and ef fect be tween the Su preme Self and the in -
di vid ual soul. The prom ise is made in the two pas sages “when the
Self is known, all this is known” and “all this is that Self.” Ac cord ing to
Asmarathya the in di vid ual soul is a prod uct of the High est Self. There -
fore the knowl edge of the cause gives rise to the knowl edge of ev ery -
thing. If the Soul and the Su preme Self are non-dif fer ent, the prom ise
that through the “knowl edge of one ev ery thing be comes known” can
be ful filled.
Ac cord ing to the view of Audulomi the dif fer ence and non-dif fer -
ence of the two de pend on dif fer ence of con di tion; the in di vid ual soul
is only a state of the high est Self or Brah man. The view of
Asmarathya and Audulomi can not stand.
Jivahood is an un re al ity. It is a cre ation of Avidya or ne science.
The in di vid ual soul is iden ti cal with Brah man in es sence. On ac count
of ig no rance we feel that we are con di tioned or lim ited by the false, il -
lu sory Upadhis and that we are dif fer ent from Brah man. Re ally the in -
di vid ual soul is nei ther cre ated nor de stroyed. If the Jivahood is a
re al ity it can never be de stroyed and lib er a tion would be im pos si ble. If
the in di vid ual soul be comes one with Brah man or the High est Self
when it at tains free dom or the fi nal eman ci pa tion, then Jivahood is il -
lu sory. The or i gin of the souls from the Su preme Self like sparks from
the fire is not real cre ation. It must be viewed only with ref er ence to
the lim it ing ad juncts.
The ob jec tor says: the pas sage, ‘Ris ing from out of these el e -
ments he van ishes again af ter them. When he has de parted there is
no more knowl edge’, in di cates the fi nal an ni hi la tion of the soul, but
not its one ness with the Su preme Self.
We re ply, this is in cor rect. The pas sage means to say only that
all sense per cep tion ceases when the soul de parts from the body, not
that the Self is an ni hi lated. The pas sage in ti mates that the eter nally
un chang ing Self which is one mass of knowl edge or con scious ness
can not cer tainly per ish but by means of true knowl edge of the Self,
dis con nec tion with the el e ments and the sense or gans, which are the
prod ucts of ig no rance, has taken place.

The in di vid ual soul and the Su preme Self dif fer in name only. It
is a set tled con clu sion that per fect knowl edge pro duces ab so lute
one ness of the two. The Self is called by many dif fer ent names but it is
One only. Per fect knowl edge is the door to Moksha or the fi nal eman -
ci pa tion. Moksha is not some thing ef fected and non-eter nal, It is eter -
nal and is not dif fer ent from the eter nally un chang ing, im mor tal, pure
Brah man who is One with out a sec ond. Those who state that there is
dis tinc tion be tween the in di vid ual and the Su preme Self are not in
har mony with the true sense of the Vedanta texts.

Prakrityadhikaranam: Topic7 (Sutra 23-27)
Brahman is both the efficient and the material cause
```
**àH¥${Vü à{VkmÑï>mÝVmZwnamoYmV²Ÿ&**

**Prakritischa pratijna drishtantanuparodhat** I.4.23 (129)
(Brahman is) the material cause also on account of (this view)
not being in conflict with the proposition and the illustrations
(quoted in the Sruti).

**Prakritih:** the material cause; **Cha:** also; **Pratijna:** the proposition;
**Drishtanta:** illustrations; **Anuparodhat:** on account of this not being
in conflict.

This Su tra states that Brah man is the ef fi cient as well as the ma -
te rial cause of the uni verse.
Brah man has been de fined as that from which pro ceed the or i -
gin, sus te nance and dis so lu tion of this uni verse. Now a doubt arises
whether Brah man is the ma te rial cause like clay or gold, or the ef fi -
cient or op er a tive cau sal ity like pot ter or gold smith.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor holds that Brah man is the only
op er a tive or the ef fi cient cause of the world, as in texts like, “He re -
flected, he cre ated Prana” Pras. Up. VI.3 & 4. Ob ser va tion and ex pe -
ri ence in ti mate that the ac tion of op er a tive causes only such as
pot ters and the like is pre ceded by think ing or re flec tion. It is, there -
fore, quite cor rect that we should re gard the cre ator also in the same
light. The cre ator is de clared as the ‘Lord’. Lords such as kings are
known only as op er a tive causes. The Su preme Lord must be re -
garded as an op er a tive cause.
This Su tra re futes this _prima_ fa cie view of the Purvapakshin.
Brah man is also the ma te rial cause of this uni verse. The term ‘cha’
(also) in di cates that Brah man is the ef fi cient cause as well. Only if
Brah man is the ma te rial cause of the uni verse it is pos si ble to know
ev ery thing through the knowl edge of Brah man. “Have you ever asked
for that in struc tion by which that which is not heard be comes heard;
that which is not per ceived, per ceived; that which is not known,
known?” (Chh. Up. IV.1-2), which de clare that the ef fects are not dif -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 138
```

fer ent from their ma te rial cause, be cause we know from or di nary ex -
pe ri ence that the car pen ter is dif fer ent from the house he has built.
The il lus tra tions re ferred to here are “My dear, as by one lump of
clay all that is made of clay is known, the mod i fi ca tion i.e., the ef fect

be ing a name merely which has its or i gin in speech, while the truth is
that it is clay merely” etc. (Chh. Up. VI-1-14). These texts clearly in di -
cate that Brah man is the ma te rial cause of the uni verse, oth er wise
they would be mean ing less.
Prom is ing state ments are made in other places also. For in -

stance “What is that through which if it is known ev ery thing else be -
comes known,” Mun. Up. I.1.3. “When the Self has been seen, heard,
per ceived and known then all this is known” (Bri. Up. IV-5-6). All these
prom is sory state ments and il lus tra tive in stances which are to be

found in all Vedanta texts prove that Brah man is also the ma te rial
cause.
There is no other guid ing be ing than Brah man. We have to con -
clude from this that Brah man is the ef fi cient cause at the same time.
Lumps of clay and pieces of gold are de pend ent on ex tra ne ous op er -

a tive causes such as pot ters and gold smiths in or der to shape them -
selves into ves sels and or na ments; but out side Brah man as ma te rial
cause there is no other op er a tive or ef fi cient cause to which the ma te -
rial cause could look, be cause the scrip ture says that Brah man was

One with out a sec ond pre vi ous to cre ation. Who else could be an ef fi -
cient or op er a tive cause when there was noth ing else?
If that were ad mit ted that there is a guid ing prin ci ple dif fer ent
from the ma te rial cause, in that case ev ery thing can not be known

through one thing. Con se quently the prom is sory state ments and the
il lus tra tions would be stul ti fied.
There fore Brah man is the ef fi cient cause, be cause there is no
other rul ing prin ci ple. He is the ma te rial cause as well be cause there
is no other sub stance from which the uni verse can take its or i gin.
For the sake of har mony be tween the prop o si tion to be es tab -

lished and il lus tra tions given therein, we con clude that Brah man is
the ma te rial cause of the world. The text ex pressly de clares Him to be
the ef fi cient or op er a tive cause as well.

“May I be many” shows that Brah man Him self be came many.
There fore He is the ma te rial cause as well.
He willed to man i fest Him self as many i.e., as the uni verse.
He willed to evolve the uni verse out of Him self. This in ti mates
that He is at once the ma te rial and the ef fi cient cause of cre ation.

And because the Sruti states that both (the origin and the

**Sakshat:** direct; **Cha:** also; **Ubhayamnanat:** because the Sruti
states both.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 23 is con tin ued.
This Su tra pro vides a fur ther ar gu ment for Brah man’s be ing the
gen eral ma te rial cause.
That from which a thing takes its or i gin and into which it is with -
drawn, and ab sorbed is its ma te rial cause. This is well known. Thus
the earth, for in stance, is the ma te rial cause of rice, bar ley and the
like. “All these things take their or i gin from the Akasa (Brah man)
alone and re turn into the Akasa” Chh. Up. I-9-1.
“That from which these things are pro duced, by which, when
pro duced they live, and into which they en ter at their dis so lu tion—try
to know that. That is Brah man” Tait. Up. III.1. These Upanishadic pas -
sages in di cate clearly that Brah man is the ma te rial cause also.
The word ‘Sakshat’ (di rect) in the Su tra shows that there is no
other ma te rial cause, but that all this orig i nated from the Akasa (Brah -
man) only. Ob ser va tion and ex pe ri ence teach that ef fects are not
re-ab sorbed into any thing else but their ma te rial cause.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 23 is con tin ued.
We read in the Tait. Up. II-7 “That It self man i fested It self.” This
in ti mates that Brah man alone cre ated the world out of It self, which is
pos si ble only by un der go ing mod i fi ca tion. This rep re sents the Self as
the ob ject of ac tion as well as the agent. So He is the Karta (cre -

means of Parinama (evo lu tion or mod i fi ca tion).
The word ‘It self’ in ti mates the ab sence of any other op er a tive
cause but the Self. The mod i fi ca tion is ap par ent (Vivarta), ac cord ing
to Sri Sankaracharya. It is real, ac cord ing to Sri Ramanujacharya.
The world is un real in the sense that it is not per ma nent. It is an il lu -
sion in the sense it has only a phe nom e nal ex is tence, it has no ex is -
tence sep a rate from Brah man.

**`mo{Zü {h Jr`VoŸ&**

**Yonischa hi giyate** I.4.27 (133)

And because (Brahman) is called the source.

**Yoni:** the womb, the source, the origin; **Cha:** and; **Hi:** because;
**Giyate:** is called.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 23 is con tin ued.
Brah man is the ma te rial cause of the uni verse, also be cause He
is stated in Sruti to be the source of the uni verse.
We read in Mundaka Upanishad III-1-3, “The Maker, the Lord,
the Per son, who has his source in Brah man” and “that which the wise
re gard as the Source of all be ings” Mun. Up. I-1-6.
_Achintyam-avyaktam-ananta rupam, sivam, prasantam
amritam brahmayonim; Tamadimadhyantavihinam-ekam vibhum

the uni verse, with out be gin ning, mid dle and end, with out ri val, all-per -
vad ing, all-con scious ness, all-bliss, in vis i ble, and in scru ta ble
(Kaivalya Up. 6)—this in di cates that Brah man is the ma te rial cause of
the world.
The word Yoni or womb al ways de notes the ma te rial cause, as
in the sen tence “the earth is the Yoni or womb of herbs and trees.”
It is thus proved or es tab lished that Brah man is the ma te rial
cause of the uni verse.

By what has been said in the fore go ing Sutras it is to be un der -

dis cussed points to Brah man, the only cause of the world.
By thus dis prov ing the doc trine of Pradhana be ing the cause of
the world all have been re futed. By over throw ing the chief dis pu tant
oth ers are over thrown just as by de feat ing the com mander all the oth -
ers are also de feated. Thus those who at trib ute cre ation to at oms and
other the o rists are all de feated.
All doc trines that speak of two sep a rate causes are re futed. The
atomic the ory and other the o ries are not based on scrip tural au thor ity.
They con tra dict many scrip tural texts.
The Sankhya doc trine ac cord ing to which the Pradhana is the
cause of the uni verse, has in the Sutras be gin ning with I.1.5 been
again and again brought for ward and re futed.
The doc trine of Pradhana stands some what near to the Vedanta
doc trine as it ad mits the non-dif fer ence of cause and ef fect like the
Vedanta doc trine. Fur ther, it has been ac cepted by some of the au -
thors of the Dharma Sutras such as Devala and oth ers. More over the
Vedanta texts con tain some pas sages which to some peo ple who are
en dowed with dull in tel lect may ap pear to con tain in fer en tial marks
point ing to it. For all these rea sons the com men ta tor has taken spe -

INTRODUCTION

Smriti-nyaya-virodha-parihara forms the topic of the first Pada.
The Smritivirodha is dealt with in Sutras 1-3 and 12 also. The
Nyayavirodha is treated in the rest of the Sutras. Pada (Sec tion) 2 at -
tacks the var i ous Darsanas or sys tems of phi los o phy on their own
grounds. The Third and Fourth Padas aim at es tab lish ing a unity of
pur port in the ap par ently di ver gent and in con sis tent cos mo log i cal
and psy cho log i cal thoughts of the sev eral Vedanta pas sages. Thus
the ti tle Avirodha or ab sence of con tra dic tion given to the chap ter is
quite ap pro pri ate.
It has been shown in the First Chap ter that the Om ni scient Lord

of all is the cause of the or i gin of the world just as clay is the ma te rial
cause of pots etc., and gold of golden or na ments. It has been con clu -
sively proved also in the First Chap ter that all the Vedanta texts treat
of Brah man as the First Cause and that Brah man is the im port of all
the Vedanta texts. This was es tab lished by the Samanvaya.
Just as the ma gi cian is the cause of the sub sis tence of the mag i -
cal il lu sion, so also Brah man is the cause of the sub sis tence of this
uni verse by His Rul er ship. Just as the four classes of crea tures are
re ab sorbed into the earth, so also, pro jected world is fi nally re ab -
sorbed into His es sence dur ing Pralaya or dis so lu tion.
It has been fur ther proved also that the Lord is the Self of all be -
ings.
The doc trine of Pradhana be ing the cause of the world has been

re futed in the First Chap ter as it is not based on the au thor ity of the
scrip tures.
In this Sec tion the ar gu ments based on rea son ing against the
doc trine which speaks of Brah man as the First Cause are re futed.

Smritis to es tab lish the doc trine of Pradhana and the the ory of the at -

**SYNOPSIS**
Pre vi ously it has been proved on the au thor ity of Sruti that the
mat ter or Pradhana is not the cause of the world. The First Chap ter
has proved that all the Vedantic texts unan i mously teach that there is
only one cause of the uni verse, viz., Brah man, whose na ture is in tel li -
gence. It has also been proved that there is no scrip tural text which
can be used to es tab lish sys tems op posed to the Vedanta, more par -
tic u larly the Sankhya sys tem.
The first two Padas of the Sec ond Chap ter re fute any ob jec tions
which may be raised against the Vedanta doc trine on purely spec u la -
tive grounds apart from the au thor ity of the Srutis. They also show
that no sys tem that can not be rec on ciled with the Vedanta can be es -
tab lished in a sat is fac tory man ner.
Sec tion I (Pada) of the Sec ond Chap ter proves by ar gu ments
that Brah man is the cause of the world and re moves all ob jec tions
that may be lev elled against such con clu sion.
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-2) re futes the ob jec tion of the Sankhyas
that the ac cept ing of the sys tem of Vedanta in volves the re jec tion of
the Sankhya doc trine which con sti tutes a part of Smriti and so has
claims or con sid er ation. The Vedanta re plies that the ac cep tance of
the Sankhya Smriti would force us to re ject other Smritis such as the
Manu Smriti which are op posed to the doc trine of the Sankhyas. The
Veda does not con firm the Sankhya Smriti but only those Smritis
which teach that the uni verse takes its or i gin from an in tel li gent cre -
ator or in tel li gent pri mary cause (Brah man).
_Adhikarana II:_ (Su tra 3) ex tends the same line of ar gu men ta tion
to the Yoga-Smriti. It dis cards the the ory of the Yoga phi los o phy of
Patanjali re gard ing the cause of the world.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 4-5) raises an ob jec tion that as Brah man
and the world are not sim i lar in na ture and prop er ties, one be ing sen -
tient, etc., and the other in sen tient, etc., Brah man can not be the
cause of the uni verse.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 6-7) re futes the ob jec tion by stat ing that
there are in stances in the world of gen er a tion of the in an i mate from
the an i mate as, for in stance, the pro duc tion of hair from the liv ing
body, also of the an i mate from the in an i mate as, for in stance, the birth
of scor pi ons and other in sects from cow-dung. They prove that it is
not nec es sary that the cause and the caused should be sim i lar in all
re spects.

```

```

_Adhikarana III:_ (Su tra 8) raises an ob jec tion that at the time of
gen eral dis so lu tion, when the ef fect (world) is merged in the cause
(Brah man), the lat ter must be con tam i nated by the for mer.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Su tra 9) re futes the ob jec tion by show ing that
there are di rect in stances to the con trary, just as the prod ucts of the
earth such as jars etc., at the time of dis so lu tion do not change earth
into their own na ture; but, on the con trary, they are them selves
changed into the sub stance of earth.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 10-11), _Adhikarana IV:_ (Su tra 12),
_Adhikarana IX:_ (Su tra 29) show that ar gu ments di rected against the
view that Brah man is the cause of the world may be lev elled against
the op po nents as well, such as the Sankhyas and the Vaiseshikas,
be cause in the Sankhya sys tem, the name less Pradhana pro duces
all names and forms and in the Vaiseshika sys tem in vis i ble and form -
less at oms unite and form a vis i ble world. The Sutras state that ar gu -
ments may be pro longed with out any con clu sion be ing ar rived at and
that the con clu sion of the Vedas only is to be re spected. All the views
which are an tag o nis tic to the Vedas are ruth lessly re futed.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Su tra 13) teaches that al though the en joy ing
souls and the ob jects are in re al ity noth ing but Brah man, yet they may
prac ti cally be held apart, just as in or di nary life we hold apart and dis -
tin guish as sep a rate in di vid ual things, the waves, the rip ples and
foam of the ocean al though they are in es sence iden ti cal and only sea
wa ter.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 14-20) treats of the non-dif fer ence of the
ef fect from the cause, a doc trine of the Vedanta which is de fended by
the fol low ers of the Vedanta against the Vaiseshikas. Ac cord ing to the
Vaiseshikas, the ef fect is some thing dif fer ent from the cause.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 21-22) re futes the ob jec tion that Brah -
man in the form of the in di vid ual soul is sub ject to plea sure and pain
by show ing that though Brah man as sumes the form of the in di vid ual
soul, yet He tran scends the lat ter and re mains un tainted by any prop -
erty of Jiva whom He con trols from within. Though the in di vid ual soul
or Jiva is no other than Brah man Him self, yet Brah man re mains the
ab so lute Lord and as such above plea sure and pain. Jiva is a slave of
Avidya. Brah man is the con trol ler of Maya. When Jiva is freed from
Avidya, he be comes iden ti cal with Brah man.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Sutras 23-25) shows that Brah man, al though
de void of ma te rial and in stru ments of ac tion, may yet cre ate the world
through His Sat-Sankalpa or will power, just as gods by their mere
power of vo li tion cre ate pal aces, an i mals and the like and milk by it self
turns into curds.
_Adhikarana IX:_ (Sutras 26-29) ex plains that Brah man does not
en tirely trans form Him self into the uni verse though He is with out
parts. Al though He pro jects the world from Him self, yet He re mains

one and un di vided. The world is un real. The change is only ap par ent
like the snake is the rope but not real. Brah man is not ex hausted in
the cre ation.
_Adhikarana X:_ (Sutras 30-31) teaches that Brah man, al though
de void of in stru ments of ac tion, is able to cre ate the uni verse by
means of the di verse pow ers He pos sesses.
_Adhikarana XI:_ (Sutras 32-33) ex plains that Brah man has no
mo tive in cre at ing the world but pro jects the uni verse out of mere
sport ing im pulse which is in her ent in Him.
_Adhikarana XII:_ (Sutras 34-36) jus ti fies Brah man from the
charges of par tial ity and cru elty which are brought against Him ow ing
to the in equal ity of po si tion and fate of the var i ous per sons and the
uni ver sal suf fer ing in the world. Brah man acts as a cre ator and dis -
penser with ref er ence to the merit and de merit of the in di vid ual souls.
_Adhikarana XIII:_ (Su tra 37) sums up the pre ced ing ar gu ments
and states that all the at trib utes of Brah man, viz., Om ni science, Om -
nip o tence and the like, are found ap pro pri ate in Brah man alone and
none else and are such as to ca pac i tate Him for the cre ation of the
uni verse. Brah man is, there fore, the cause of the world.

If it be objected that (from the doctrine of Brahman being the
cause of the world) there would result the defect of there being
no room for certain Smritis (we say) no, because (by the
rejection of that doctrine) there would result the defect of want
of room for some other Smriti.

**Smriti:** the Sankhya philosophy; **Anavakasa:** no room; **Dosha:**
defect; **Prasangat:** Result, chance; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not;
**Anyasmriti:** other Smritis; **Anavakasadoshaprasangat:** because
there would result the defect of want of room for other Smritis.

The con clu sion ar rived at in Chap ter I—Sec tion IV, that Brah -
man is the cause of the world is cor rob o rated by Smritis other than
Sankhya. The ear li est and the most or tho dox of these Smritis is the
Smriti writ ten by Manu.
If you say that one set of Smritis will be ig nored if it is said that
Pradhana is not the cause of the world, will not an other set of Smritis

pends on Dharma and Dharma de pends on the Vedas. No Siddha is
au thor i ta tive if his view is con trary to that of the Sruti. Smritis which
are op posed to the Vedas should be re jected ruth lessly.
Kapila ac knowl edges a plu ral ity of selfs. He does not ad mit the
doc trine of there be ing one uni ver sal Self. The sys tem of Kapila con -
tra dicts the Vedas, not only the as sump tion of an in de pend ent
Pradhana but also by its hy poth e sis of a plu ral ity of selfs. We can not
ex plain the Vedanta texts in such a man ner as not to bring them into
con flict with Kapila Smriti. Kapila Smriti con tra dicts the Srutis. Hence

world pro duced the golden col oured Brahma (Kapila) in or der to

Fur ther such prin ci ples as Mahat etc., which are said to be prod -

pe ri ence. On the other hand the el e ments and the senses are found
in the Veda and in the world and hence may be re ferred to in the
Smriti. Hence such words as Mahat etc., found in Smritis do not re fer
to prod ucts of Pradhana but to other cat e go ries re vealed in the Sruti.
See I.4.1.
There is no men tion of the other cat e go ries of the Sankhyas
any where in the Vedas. There fore the Sankhya sys tem can not be au -
thor i ta tive.
Sankaracharya has proved that by the word Mahat we have to
un der stand ei ther the cos mic in tel lect or Hiranyagarbha or the in di vid -
ual soul, but in no case the Mahat of the Sankhya phi los o phy i.e., the
first prod uct of the Prakriti.
It is not only be cause Sankhya teaches that Pradhana is the au -
thor of cre ation which makes it un au thori ta tive, but it teaches other
doc trines also which have no foun da tion in the Vedas. It teaches that
souls are pure con scious ness and all-per vad ing, that bond age and

Refutation of Yoga
```
**EVoZ `moJ... àË`wº$...Ÿ&**

**Etena yogah pratyuktah** II.1.3 (137)

By this the Yoga philosophy is (also) refuted.

**Etena:** by this viz., by the refutation of the Sankhya Smriti; **Yogah:** the
Yoga philosophy; **Pratyuktah:** is (also) refuted.

The Yoga phi los o phy of Patanjali is re futed here. Yoga is called
“Sesvara-Sankhya”.
The Purvapakshin says: The Yoga sys tem is given in the
Upanishads also, like the Svetavatara Upanishad etc. “Hold ing his
head, neck, trunk erect” etc. Svet. Up. II-8. “The Self is to be heard, to
be thought of, to be med i tated upon” Bri. Up. II-4-5. “This the firm
hold ing back of the senses is what is called Yoga” Katha Up. II-3-11.
“Hav ing re ceived this knowl edge and the whole rule of Yoga” Katha.
Up. II-3-18. Yoga is an aid to the con cen tra tion of mind. With out con -
cen tra tion one can not have knowl edge of Brah man. Hence Yoga is a
means to knowl edge. As the Yoga Smriti is based on the Srutis, it is
au thor i ta tive. The Yoga Smriti ac knowl edges the Pradhana which is
the First Cause.
For the same rea son as ad duced against the Sankhya sys tem,
the Yoga phi los o phy by Patanjali is also re futed as it also ac cepts the
the ory that Prakriti is the cause of the uni verse.
This Su tra re marks that by the ref u ta tion of the Sankhya Smriti
the Yoga Smriti also is to be con sid ered as re futed be cause the Yoga
phi los o phy also re cog nises, in op po si tion to scrip ture, a Pradhana as
the in de pend ent cause of the world and the great prin ci ple etc., as its
ef fects al though the Veda or com mon ex pe ri ence is not in fa vour of
these views.
Though the Smriti is partly au thor i ta tive it should be re jected as
it con tra dicts the Srutis on other top ics.
Al though there are many Smritis which treat of the soul, we have
di rected our at ten tion to re fute the Sankhya and Yoga, be cause they
are widely known as of fer ing the means for at tain ing the high est end
of man. More over, they have ob tained the ap pre ci a tion of many great
per sons. Fur ther their po si tion is strength ened by Sruti “He who has
known that cause which is to be ap pre hended by Sankhya and Yoga
he is freed from all fet ters” Svet. Up. VI-13.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 148
```

We say that the high est goal of man can not be at tained by the
knowl edge of the Sankhya Smriti, or Yoga prac tice. Sruti clearly says
that the fi nal eman ci pa tion or the su preme be at i tude can only be ob -

tained by the knowl edge of the unity of the Self which is con veyed by
the Veda. “Only the man who knows Brah man crosses over Death,
there is no other path to go” Svet. Up. III-8.
The Sankhya and Yoga sys tems main tain du al ity. They do not

dis cern the unity of the Self. In the text cited “That cause which is to be
known by Sankhya and Yoga”, the terms ‘Sankhya’ and ‘Yoga’ de note

Ve dic knowl edge and med i ta tion as these terms are used in a pas -
sage stand ing close to other pas sages which re fer to Ve dic knowl -
edge.
We cer tainly al low room for those por tions of the two sys tems

which do not con tra dict the Veda. The Sankhyas say, “The soul is free
from all qual i ties (Asanga).” This is in har mony with the Veda which
de clares that Purusha is es sen tially pure. “For that per son is not at -

tached to any thing” Bri. Up. IV-3-16.
The Yoga pre scribes re tire ment from the con cerns of life
(Nivritti) for the wan der ing Sannyasin. This is cor rob o rated by the
Sruti. “Then the Parivrajaka with or ange robe, shaven, with out any

pos ses sion” etc. Jabala Upanishad V.
Their rea son ing is ac cept able to the ex tent to which it leads to
Self-reali sa tion.
The above re marks will serve as a re ply to the claims of all ar gu -
men ta tive Smritis. We hold that the truth can be real ised nor known

from the Vedanta texts only, “None who does not know the Veda per -
ceives the great one” Taittiriya Brahmana III-12.9.7. “I now ask thee
that Per son taught in the Upanishads” Bri. Up. III-9-26.

CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 149
```

There are eight Sutras in this Adhikarana. The first and the sec -
ond ex press the Purvapaksha (ob jec tion) and the oth ers ex press the
true doc trine (Siddhanta).
The ob jec tions founded on Smriti against the doc trine of Brah -
man be ing the ef fi cient and the ma te rial cause of the uni verse have
been re futed. We now pro ceed to re fute those founded on rea son ing.
Some plau si ble ob jec tions against Brah man be ing the cause of
the world are raised in this Su tra and the sub se quent one.
The ob jec tor says: Brah man is in tel li gence. Brah man is pure.
But the uni verse is ma te rial, in sen tient and im pure. There fore, it is dif -
fer ent from the na ture of Brah man. Hence, Brah man can not be the
cause of this world.
The ef fect must be of the same na ture as the cause. The ef fect
is only cause in an other form. The cause and ef fect can not be en tirely
of a dif fer ent na ture. The in tel li gent and sen tient Brah man can not pro -
duce non-in tel li gent, in sen tient, ma te rial uni verse. If Brah man is
taken to be the cause of the world, the na ture of the two must be sim i -
lar. But they ap pear to be quite dif fer ent in es sence or na ture. Hence,
Brah man can not be the cause of the world.
The dif fer ence in na ture is also known from the state ments of
Sruti, “Brah man be came in tel li gence as well as non-in tel li gence
(world)” (Taittiriya Upanishad, Brahmananda Valli, Sixth
Anuvaka— _Vijnanam cha avijnanam cha abhavat_ ). There fore, Brah -
man can not be the cause of the ma te rial uni verse. Brah man, which is
pure spirit, can not be the cause of this uni verse, which is im pure mat -
ter. The world which con sists of pain, plea sure and il lu sion can not be
de rived from Brah man.

**A{^_m{Zì`nXoeñVw {deofmZwJ{Vä`m_²Ÿ&**

**Abhimanivyapadesastu viseshanugatibhyam** II.1.5 (139)
But the reference is to the presiding deities (of the organs) on
account of the special characterisation and also from the fact
of a deity so presiding.

**Abhimani:** the presiding deity (of the organs and the elements);
**Vyapadesah:** an expression, an indication, pointing out of,
denotation of; **Tu:** but; **Visesha:** specific adjunct, on account of
distinction, because of so being qualified; **Anugatibhyam:** the act of
pervading; **Viseshanugatibhyam:** from the specific adjunct as well
as from the fact of pervading, on account of their entering.

This Su tra meets an ob jec tion to Su tra 4. The word ‘Tu’ (but) dis -
cards the doubt raised.
When ever an in an i mate ob ject is de scribed in Smriti as be hav -
ing like an i mate be ings, we are to un der stand that it is an in di ca tion of
a de ity pre sid ing over it. In the case of ac tions like speak ing, dis put -
ing, and so on, which re quire in tel li gence, the scrip tural texts do not

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 150
```

de note the mere ma te rial el e ments and or gans but rather the in tel li -
gent de i ties which pre side over each or gan viz., speech, etc.
You will find in Kaushitaki Upanishad: “The de i ties con tend ing
with each other for who was the best.” “All the de i ties re cog nised the
pre-em i nence in Prana” (Kau. Up. II-14). The Kaushitakins make ex -
press use of the word “de i ties” in or der to ex clude the idea of the mere
ma te rial or gans be ing meant. Aitareya Aranyaka (II-2-4) says, “Agni
hav ing be come speech en tered the mouth”. This shows that each or -
gan is con nected with its own pre sid ing de ity.
There is a text in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (VI-I-7) which
says, “These or gans quar relled over their re spec tive great ness.”
The texts of Chhandogya Upanishad also show the ex is tence of
such pre sid ing de i ties. “The fire thought and pro duced wa ter.” This in -
di cates that the in an i mate ob ject may be called God hav ing ref er ence
to its pre sid ing de ity. The thought spo ken of is that of the High est De -
ity which is con nected with the ef fects as a su per in tend ing prin ci ple.
All these strengthen the hy poth e sis that the texts re fer to the su per in -
tend ing de i ties.
From all this, we have to con clude that this uni verse is dif fer ent
in na ture from Brah man. There fore, the Uni verse can not have Brah -
man for its ma te rial cause.
The next Su tra gives a very suit able re ply to the ob jec tion raised
by the Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor.

**Ñí`Vo VwŸ&**

**Drishyate tu** II.1.6 (140)
But it (such organisation of life from matter) is also seen.

**Drishyate:** is seen; **Tu:** but.

Ob jec tion raised in Sutras 4 and 5 are now re futed.
The word ‘but’ dis cards the Purvapaksha. ‘But’ re futes the
Purvapakshin’s or ob jec tor’s views ex pressed in the last Su tra, viz.,
that this uni verse can not have orig i nated from Brah man, be cause it is
dif fer ent in char ac ter. For we see that from man who is in tel li gent,
non-in tel li gent things such as hair and nails orig i nate, and that from
non-in tel li gent mat ter such as cow-dung, scor pi ons etc., are pro -
duced. So the ob jec tions raised in Sutras 4 and 5 are not valid. Hence
it is quite pos si ble that this ma te rial uni verse could be pro duced by an
in tel li gent Be ing, Brah man. Orig i na tion of in sen tient cre ation from the
sen tient Cre ator is not un rea son able.
The Mundaka Upanishad says “Just as the spi der stretches
forth and gath ers to gether its threads, as herbs grow out of the earth,
as from a liv ing man co mes out the hair, so also from the Im per ish able
co mes out this uni verse” (I.1.7).

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 151
```

The ob jec tor may say that the body of a man is the cause of the
hair and nails and not the man, and the cow-dung is the cause of the
body of the scor pion, etc. Even then, there is dif fer ence in char ac ter
be tween the cause, the dung and the ef fect, the body of the scor pion,
in so far as some non-in tel li gent mat ter (the body) is the abode of an
in tel li gent prin ci ple (the soul of the scor pion), which the other non-in -
tel li gent mat ter (the cow-dung) is not. They are not sim i lar in all re -
spects. If they were, then there would be noth ing like cause and
ef fect. If you ex pect to find all the as pects of Brah man in the world,
then what is the dif fer ence be tween cause and ef fect?
The cause and its ef fects are not sim i lar in all re spects, but
some thing in the cause is found in the ef fect also, just as clay in the
lump is found in the jar also, though the shape, etc., of the two vary.
The very re la tion ship of cause and ef fect im plies that there is some
dif fer ence be tween the two. Some qual i ties of the cause, Brah man,
such as ex is tence and in tel li gence, are found in Its ef fect, the uni -
verse. All ob jects in the uni verse ex ist. The uni verse gets this qual ity
from Brah man, which is Ex is tence it self. Fur ther the in tel li gence of
Brah man il lu mines the en tire world. The two qual i ties of Brah man,
viz., ex is tence and in tel li gence, are found in the uni verse. Hence it is
quite proper to take Brah man as the cause of this uni verse, though
there may be some dif fer ence in other re spects be tween them.

**Asaditi chet na pratishedhamatratvat** II.1.7 (141)

If it be said (that the world, the effect, would then be)
non-existent (before its origination or creation), (we say) no,
because it is a mere negation (without any basis).

**Asat:** non-existence; **Iti chet:** if it be said; **Na:** no;
**Pratishedhamatratvat:** because of denial, as it simply denies.

An ob jec tion to Su tra 6 is raised and re futed.
The op po nent says that if Brah man which is in tel li gent, pure and
de void of qual i ties such as sound and so on, is the cause of the uni -
verse which is of an op po site na ture, i.e., non-in tel li gent, im pure, pos -
sess ing the qual i ties of sound, etc., it fol lows that the ef fect, i.e., the
world, was non-ex is tent be fore its ac tual orig i na tion, be cause Brah -
man was then the only ex is tence. This means that some thing which
was non-ex ist ing is brought into ex is tence, which is not ac cepted by
the Vedantins who main tain the doc trine of the ef fect ex ist ing in the
cause al ready.
The ob jec tion raised by the op po nent is no real ob jec tion. It has
no force on ac count of its be ing a mere ne ga tion.
This Su tra re futes the ob jec tion raised by the op po nent. It de -
clares that this ne ga tion is a mere state ment with out any ob jec tive va -
lid ity. If you neg a tive the ex is tence of the ef fect pre vi ous to its ac tual

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 152
```

orig i na tion, your ne ga tion is a mere ne ga tion with out any ob ject to be
neg a tived. The ef fect cer tainly ex ists in the cause be fore its orig i na -
tion and also af ter it. The ef fect can never ex ist in de pend ently, apart
from the cause ei ther be fore or af ter cre ation. The Sruti says, “Who -
so ever looks for any thing else where than in Brah man is aban doned
by ev ery thing” (Bri. Up. II-4-6).
There fore, the uni verse ex ists in Brah man even be fore cre ation.
It is not ab so lutely non-ex is tent.

**AnrVm¡ VX²dËàg“mXg_ÄOg_²Ÿ&**

**Apitau tadvatprasangadasamanjasam** II.1.8 (142)

On account of the consequence that at the time of Pralaya or
great dissolution (the cause becomes) like that (i.e., like the
effect), the doctrine maintained hitherto (that Brahman is the
cause of the universe) is absurd.

**Apitau:** at the time of Pralaya or the great dissolution; **Tadvat:** like
that, like the effect; **Prasangat:** on account of the consequences;
**Asamanjasam:** inconsistent, absurd.

A plau si ble ob jec tion against Brah man be ing the cause of the
world is raised here.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent raises fur ther ob jec tions.
Dur ing dis so lu tion the ef fect, i.e., the world, is ab sorbed in the
cause, the Brah man. Con se quently, it fol lows that the cause be -
comes like the ef fect. The cause is af fected by the na ture of the ef fect.
The evils of de fects in her ent in the ef fect will taint the cause. Brah man
must be af fected by the na ture of the world, just as wa ter is af fected
by the salt which is dis solved in it, just as the whole food is scented by
the pun gent smell of asafoetida when it is mixed with any con di ment.
He would be come im pure and would no more be the Om ni scient
cause of the uni verse as the Upanishads hold. He must be come in -
sen tient, gross, lim ited, like the world, which is ab surd. Brah man,
there fore, can not be the cause of the world.
There is an other ob jec tion also. Dur ing dis so lu tion all things
have gone into a state of one ness with Brah man. All dis tinc tions pass
at the time of re ab sorp tion into the state of non-dis tinc tion. Then there
would be no spe cial cause left at the time of a new be gin ning of the
uni verse. Con se quently, the new world could not arise with all the dis -
tinc tions of en joy ing souls, ob jects to be en joyed, etc. There will be no
fac tor bring ing about cre ation again.
The third ob jec tion is, if in spite of this a new cre ation is pos si ble,
then even the lib er ated souls or the Muktas who have be come one
with Brah man, will be dragged into re birth.
It can not be said that the uni verse re mains dis tinct from the
High est Brah man even in the state of re ab sorp tion or dis so lu tion, be -

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 153
```

cause in that case it would be no dis so lu tion at all. The ef fect ex ist ing
sep a rate from the cause is not pos si ble.
Hence the Vedanta doc trine of Brah man be ing the cause of the
uni verse is ob jec tion able as it leads to all sorts of ab sur di ties.
The next Su tra gives a suit able re ply to this.

**Z Vw Ñï>mÝV^mdmV²Ÿ&**

**Na tu drishtantabhavat** II.1.9 (143)
But not (so) on account of the existence of illustrations.

**Na:** not; **Tu:** but; **Drishtantabhavat:** on account of illustrations.

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 8 is re futed.
By the word ‘tu’ (but) the pos si bil ity of the ob jec tion is set aside.
The ob jec tions have no force. Why should an ef fect which is re -
solved into the cause again af fect the cause by in tro duc ing the de -
fects of the ef fect? When the ef fect is in volved in the cause, it does not
at all taint the cause by its ef fects. There are in nu mer a ble in stances. If
a good or na ment is melted into gold, how can the pe cu liar i ties of form
of the or na ment ap pear in the gold?
When a jar made up of clay is bro ken and re ab sorbed into its
orig i nal sub stance, i.e., clay, it does not im part to it its spe cial fea tures
or qual i ties. It does not turn the earth into pots and pitch ers but it is it -
self trans formed as earth. The four-fold com plex of or ganic be ings
which springs from the earth does not im part its qual i ties to the lat ter
at the time of re-ab sorp tion.
Re ab sorp tion can not oc cur at all if the ef fect, when re solv ing
back into its causal sub stance, con tin ues to sub sist there with all its
in di vid ual prop er ties.
De spite the non-dif fer ence of cause and ef fect, the ef fect has its
self in the cause but not the cause in the ef fect. The ef fect is of the na -
ture of the cause and not the cause the na ture of the ef fect. There fore
the qual i ties of the ef fect can not touch the cause.
In stead of Brah man be ing trans formed into the world, the world
is trans formed into Brah man, be ing merged in Him at the time of its
dis so lu tion. Hence there can not be any ob jec tion to Brah man be ing
ac cepted as the cause of the world on the ground sug gested in
Sutra 8.
Though the world is full of mis ery, etc., yet Brah man is all pure,
etc. He re mains al ways un touched by evil. As youth, child hood and
old age be long to the body only and not to the Self, as blind ness and
deaf ness etc., be long to the senses and not to the Self, so the de fects
of the world do not be long to Brah man and do not per vade the pure
Brah man.
If cause and ef fect are sep a rate as you say, there will be no in -
vo lu tion at all. As cause and ef fect are one and the same, the ob jec -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 154
```

tion that the de fects of the ef fect will af fect the cause is not pe cu liar to
in vo lu tion alone. If what the Purvapakshin says is cor rect, the de fect
will af fect the cause even now. That the iden tity of cause and ef fect of
Brah man and the uni verse, holds good in dis crim i nately with re gard to
all time, not only the time of in vo lu tion or re ab sorp tion is de clared in
many scrip tural pas sages, as for in stance—This ev ery thing is that
Self (Bri. Up. II.4.6). The Self is all this (Chh. Up. VII.25.2). The Im -
mor tal Brah man is this be fore (Mun. Up. II.2. 1 1). All this is Brah man
(Chh. Up. III.14.1).
If it is said that the de fects are the ef fects of su per im po si tion of
Avidya or ne science and can not af fect the cause, this ex pla na tion will
ap ply to in vo lu tion also.
Co bra is not af fected by the poi son. A ma gi cian is not af fected
by the mag i cal il lu sion pro duced by him self, be cause it is un real.
Even so Brah man is not af fected by Maya. The world is only an il lu -
sion or ap pear ance. Brah man ap pears as this uni verse, just as a rope
ap pears as the snake. There fore Brah man is un af fected by Maya or
the world il lu sion. No one is af fected by his dream-cre ations or the il -
lu sory vi sions of his dream, be cause they do not ac com pany the wak -
ing state and the state of dream less sleep. Sim i larly the Eter nal
Wit ness of all states of con scious ness is not af fected by the world or
Maya.
Equally base less is the sec ond ob jec tion. There are par al lel in -
stances with ref er ence to this also. In the state of deep sleep, you do
not see any thing. The soul en ters into an es sen tial con di tion of
non-dis tinc tion. There is no di ver sity, but as soon as you wake up you
be hold the world of di ver sity. The old stage of dis tinc tion co mes
again, as ig no rance or Avidya is not de stroyed. Chhandogya
Upanishad says, “All these crea tures when they have be come
merged in the True, know not that they are merged in the True. What -
ever these crea tures are here, whether a lion, or a wolf, or a boar or a
worm or a gnat or a mos quito, that they be come again” (Chh. Up.
VI-9-2 & 3).
A sim i lar phe nom e non takes place dur ing Pralaya or dis so lu -
tion. The power of dis tinc tion re mains in a po ten tial state as Avidya or
Ne science in the state of dis so lu tion also. So long as the ba sic Avidya
or ig no rance is there, cre ation or evo lu tion will fol low in vo lu tion just as
a man wakes up af ter sleep.
The lib er ated souls will not be born again be cause in their case
wrong knowl edge or ig no rance has been com pletely de stroyed by
per fect knowl edge of Brah man.
The view held by the Purvapakshin that even at the time of re ab -
sorp tion the world should re main dis tinct from Brah man is not ad mit -
ted by the Vedantins.

```

**Svapakshadosaccha** II.1.10 (144)

And because the objections (raised by the Sankhya against the
Vedanta doctrine) apply to his (Sankhya) view also.

**Svapakshadoshat:** because of the objections, to his own view; **Cha:**
and.

The ob jec tions raised in Sutras 4 and 8 are lev elled against the
op po nents.
Now the ta bles are turned on the ob jec tor. The ob jec tions raised
by him (the Sankhya) to the doc trines of Vedanta are ap pli ca ble to his
the ory as well. In his doc trine of cau sa tion also, the world of forms and
sounds takes its or i gin from Pradhana and Prakriti which has no form
or sound. Thus the cause is dif fer ent from the ef fect here also. In the
state of re ab sorp tion or dis so lu tion, all ob jects merge into Pradhana
and be come one with it.
There is per va sion into the Pradhana of all the ef fects of the
world. It is ad mit ted by the Sankhyas also that at the time of re ab sorp -
tion the ef fect passes back into the state of non-dis tinc tion from the
cause, and so the ob jec tion raised in Su tra 8 ap plies to Pradhana
also. The Sankhya will have to ad mit that be fore the ac tual be gin ning,
the ef fect was non-ex is tent. What ever ob jec tions that are raised
against Vedanta in this re spect are in fact true of the Sankhyas. That
Brah man is the cause of the world, which is ad mit ted by Sruti, can not
be thrown out by this sort of vain rea son ing. Vedanta is based on the
Srutis. Hence the doc trine of Vedanta is au thor i ta tive and in fal li ble.
There fore it must be ad mit ted. Fur ther, the Vedantic view is pref er a -
ble, be cause the ob jec tions have also been an swered from the view -
point of Vedanta. It is not pos si ble to an swer them from the view point
of the Sankhya.

Great think ers like Kapila and Kanada are seen to re fute each
other. Logic has no fix ity or fi nal ity. The de duc tions of one rea soner
are over thrown by an other. What one man es tab lishes through rea -
son can be re futed by an other man more in tel li gent and in ge nious
than he. Nei ther anal ogy nor syl lo gism can ap ply to the soul. Con clu -
sions ar rived at by mere ar gu men ta tion, how ever well-rea soned, and
not based on any au thor i ta tive state ment, can not be ac cepted as fi nal
as there still re mains the chance of their be ing re futed by more ex pert
soph ists. Hence, the con clu sion of Sruti alone must be ac cepted.
With out show ing any re gard to rea son ing we must be lieve Brah -
man to be the ma te rial cause of the uni verse, be cause the Upanishad
teaches so.
The con clu sions of Vedanta are based on the Srutis which are
in fal li ble and au thor i ta tive. Rea son ing which has no sure ba sis can -
not over throw the con clu sions of Vedanta.
Rea son has its own prov ince and scope. It is use ful in cer tain
sec u lar mat ters but in mat ters tran scen den tal such as the ex is tence
of Brah man, fi nal re lease, life be yond, the pro nounce ments of hu man
in tel lect can never be per fectly free from doubt, be cause these are
mat ters which are be yond the scope of in tel lect. Even if there is to be
any fi nal ity of rea son ing, it will not bring about any fi nal ity of doc trine
with ref er ence to the soul, be cause the soul can not be ex pe ri enced
by the senses. Brah man can not be an ob ject of per cep tion or of in fer -
ence based on per cep tion. Brah man is in con ceiv able and con se -
quently unarguable. Kathopanishad says, “This knowl edge is not to
be ob tained by ar gu ment, but it is easy to un der stand it, O
Nachiketas, when taught by a teacher who be holds no dif fer ence”
(I.2.9).
The op po nent says: You can not say that no rea son ing what ever
is well-founded be cause even the judg ment about rea son ing is ar -
rived at through rea son ing. You your self can see that rea son ing has
no foun da tion on rea son ing only. Hence the state ment that rea son ing
has never a sure ba sis is not cor rect. Fur ther, if all rea son ing were un -
founded, hu man life would have to come to an end. You must rea son
cor rectly and prop erly.
We re mark against this ar gu ment of the op po nent that thus also
then re sults “want of re lease”. Al though rea son ing is well-founded
with re spect to cer tain things, with re gard to the mat ter in hand there
will re sult “want of re lease”.
Those sages who teach about the fi nal eman ci pa tion of the
soul, de clare that it re sults from per fect knowl edge. Per fect knowl -
edge is al ways uni form. It de pends upon the thing it self. What ever
thing is per ma nently of one and the same na ture is ac knowl edged to
be the true thing. Knowl edge that per tains to this is per fect or true
knowl edge. Mu tual con flict of men’s opin ions is not pos si ble in the

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 157
```

case of true or per fect knowl edge. But the con clu sions of rea son ing
can never be uni form. The Sankhyas main tain through rea son ing that
Pradhana is the cause of the uni verse. The Naiyayikas ar rive through
rea son ing that the Paramanus or at oms are the cause of the world.
Which to ac cept? How, there fore, can knowl edge which is based on
rea son ing, and whose ob ject is not some thing al ways uni form, be
true of per fect knowl edge? We can not come to a def i nite, pos i tive
con clu sion through rea son ing in de pend ent of the Srutis. The Veda is
eter nal. It is the source of knowl edge. It has for its ob ject firmly es tab -
lished things. Knowl edge which is founded on the Veda can not be de -
nied at all by any of the lo gi cians of the past, pres ent or fu ture. As the
truth can not be known through rea son ing, there will be no lib er a tion.
We have thus es tab lished that per fec tion can be at tained
through knowl edge of Brah man with the aid of Upanishads or the
Srutis. Per fect knowl edge is not pos si ble with out the help of the
Srutis. Dis re gard of Srutis will lead to ab sence of fi nal eman ci pa tion.
Rea son ing which goes against the scrip tures is no proof of knowl -
edge.
Our fi nal po si tion is that the in tel li gent Brah man must be re -
garded as the cause and sub stra tum of the uni verse on the ground of
scrip ture and of rea son ing sub or di nate to scrip ture.

_Sishtaparigrahah_ —all other views or sys tems of thought not ac -

Aparigrahah means those sys tems which do not ac knowl edge

Like the the ory of those who say that Pradhana or Prakriti is the
cause of the world, the the o ries of those who pos tu late at oms as the
cause are re futed by those who know the truths of scrip ture, like
Manu or Vyasa, trained in the cor rect way of know ing them. The doc -

the Ve dic sys tem, and is sup ported by some what strong and weighty
ar gu ments. Fur ther, it has to a cer tain ex tent been adopted by some
au thor i ties who fol low the Veda. If the most dan ger ous en emy is con -
quered, the mi nor en e mies are al ready con quered. Even so, if the
Sankhya doc trine is re futed, all other sys tems are al ready re futed
also.
The Su tra teaches that by the de mo li tion of the Sankhya doc -

Vedas are also re futed, such as the the o ries of Kanada, Gautama,

As re gards the na ture of the atom, there is no una nim ity of opin -

The distinctions of enjoyer and enjoyed do not oppose unity
```
**^moŠÌmnÎmoa{d^mJüoËñ`mëbmoH$dV²Ÿ&**

**Bhoktrapatteravibhagaschet syallokavat** II.1.13 (147)

If it be said (that if Brahman be the cause then) on account of
(the objects of enjoyment) turning into the enjoyer,
non-distinction (between the enjoyer and the objects enjoyed)
would result, we reply that such distinction may exist
nevertheless as is experienced commonly in the world.

**Bhoktri:** one who enjoys and suffers; **Apatteh:** from the objections, if
it be objected; **Avibhagah:** non-distinction; **Chet:** if it be said; **Syat:**
may exist; **Lokavat:** as is experienced in the world.

An other ob jec tion based on rea son ing is raised against Brah -
man be ing the cause and re futed.
The dis tinc tion be tween the enjoyer (the Jiva or the in di vid ual
soul) and the ob jects of en joy ment is well known from or di nary ex pe ri -
ence. The enjoyers are in tel li gent, em bod ied souls while sound and

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 159
```

the like are the ob jects of enjoyemnt. Ramakrishna for in stance, is an
enjoyer while the mango which he eats is an ob ject of en joy ment. If
Brah man is the ma te rial cause of the uni verse, then the world, the ef -
fect would be non-dif fer ent from Brah man. The Jiva and Brah man be -
ing iden ti cal, the dif fer ence be tween the sub ject and the ob ject would
be an ni hi lated, as the one would pass over into the other. Con se -
quently, Brah man can not be held to be the ma te rial cause of the uni -
verse, as it would lead to the sublation of the well-es tab lished
dis tinc tion be tween the enjoyer and the ob jects of en joy ment.
If you say that the doc trine of Brah man be ing the cause of the
world will lead to the enjoyer or spirit be com ing one with the ob ject of
en joy ment (mat ter), we re ply that such dif fer en ti a tion is ap pro pri ate in
our case also, as in stances are found in the uni verse in the case of
ocean, its waves, foams and bub bles and of the Sun and its light. The
ocean waves, foams and bub bles are one and yet di verse in the uni -
verse. Sim i larly, are the Brah man and the world. He cre ated and en -
tered into the cre ation. He is one with them, just as the ether in the sky
and the ether in the pot are one al though they ap pear to be sep a rate.
There fore it is pos si ble to have dif fer ence and non-dif fer ence in
things at the same time ow ing to the name and form. The enjoyers
and the ob jects of en joy ment do not pass over into each other and yet
they are not dif fer ent from the Su preme Brah man. The enjoyers and
ob jects of en joy ment are not dif fer ent from the view point of Brah man
but they are dif fer ent as enjoyers and ob jects en joyed. There is not
con tra dic tion in this.
The con clu sion is that the dis tinc tion of enjoyers and ob jects of
en joy ment is pos si ble, al though both are non-dif fer ent from Brah man,
their High est Cause, as the instnce of the ocean, and its waves,
foams and bub bles dem on strates.

**Tadananyatvamarambhanasabdadibhyah** II.1.14 (148)

The non-dif fer ence of them (i.e. of cause and ef fect) re sults
from such terms as ‘or i gin’ and the like.

**Tat:** (its, of the uni verse): **Ananyatvam** : non-dif fer ence; **Arambhana
sabdadibhyah:** from words like ‘or i gin’, etc.

That the ef fect is not dif fer ent from the cause is shown here.
In su tra 13, the Sutrakara spoke from the point of view of
Parinamavada and re futed the ob jec tion raised by the op po nent that
Brah man can not be the ma te rial cause as it con tra dicts per cep tion. In
Parinamavada, Brah man ac tu ally un der goes trans for ma tion or mod i -
fi ca tion. Now the same ob jec tion is over thrown from the view point of

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 160
```

Vivartavada. In Vivartavada there is only ap par ent mod i fi ca tion. Rope
ap pears as a snake. It is not trans formed into an ac tual snake. This is
the doc trine of Advaita of Sri Sankara.
In the pre vi ous Su tra the sim ile of the ocean and the waves was
stated, ac cept ing the ap par ent va ri ety of ob jects. But in re al ity, cause
and ef fect are one even now. This is clear from the word ‘Arambhana’
(be gin ning), just as by know ing a lump of clay, all clay will be known.
Name is only a ver bal mod i fi ca tion. The true be ing is only clay. A pot is
only clay even now. Sim i larly, the world is only Brah man even now. It
is wrong to say that one ness and manifoldness are both true as in the
case of ocean and waves, etc. The word ‘eva’ in ‘Mrittiketyeva’ shows
that all di ver sity is un real. The soul is de clared to be one with Brah -
man.
The ob jec tor or Purvapakshin says: ‘If there is only one Truth
viz., Brah man, the di verse ob jects of per cep tion will be ne gated. The
eth i cal in junc tions and pro hi bi tions will lose their pur port if the dis tinc -
tion on which their va lid ity de pends does not re ally ex ist. More over,
the sci ence of lib er a tion of the soul will have no re al ity, if the dis tinc -
tion of teacher and the stu dent on which it de pends is not real. There
would be no bond age and hence no lib er a tion. As the sci ence of the
soul it self is un real, it can not lead to the Re al ity. If the doc trine of re -
lease is un true, how can we main tain the truth of the ab so lute unity of
the Self?
But these ob jects have no force be cause the whole phe nom e -
nal ex is tence is re garded as true as long as the knowl edge of Brah -
man has not arisen, just as the dream crea tures are re garded to be
true till the wak ing state ar rives. When we wake up af ter dreams, we
know the dream world to be false but the knowl edge of dreams is not
false. More over, even dreams some times fore bode the im mi nent re -
al ity of death. The re al ity of reali sa tion of Brah man can not be said to
be il lu sory be cause it de stroys ig no rance and leads to the ces sa tion
of il lu sion.

that the ef fect is not dif fer ent from the cause. The Chhandogya
Upanishad says, “All these cre ated things, O my son, orig i nate from
Sat, i.e., Brah man, rest in Him and even tu ally dis solve in Him”
(VI-8-4).
The ob jec tor says: There is no rec og ni tion of fire in the smoke.
The smoke be ing the ef fect of fire, ought to show fire in it. To this we
re ply that smoke is re ally the ef fect of damp fuel. The damp fuel co -
mes in con tact with fire and throws off its earthly par ti cles in the form
of smoke. The smoke and the fuel are iden ti cal. We can re cog nise the
fuel in the smoke. This is proved by the fact that the smoke has smell
just as the fuel has. The smoke is gen er ally of the same na ture as that
of the fuel.
The phe nom ena of the uni verse man i fest only be cause Brah -
man ex ists. They can not cer tainly ap pear with out Brah man. There -
fore the world (ef fect) is not dif fer ent from Brah man, the cause.

**Sattvat:** Be cause of the ex is tence; **Cha:** and; **Avarasya:** of the
pos te rior, i.e., of the ef fect as it co mes af ter the cause, i.e., of the
world.

The ar gu ment be gun in Su tra 14 is con tin ued.
The scrip ture says that the ef fect (the world) ex isted in its causal
as pect (Brah man) be fore the cre ation.
“In the be gin ning, my dear, _Sadeva somyedamagra asit_ , this
was only ex is tence” (Chh. Up.). “ _Atma va idam eka agra asit_ , ver ily in
the be gin ning this was Self, one only” (Ait. Ar.2.4.1). “ _Brahma va
idamagra asit_. Be fore cre ation, this uni verse ex isted as Brah man”
(Bri. Up. 1.4.10).
The Upanishads de clare that the uni verse had its be ing in the
cause, Brah man, be fore cre ation. It was one with Brah man. As the
world was non-dif fer ent from the cause be fore cre ation, it con tin ues
to be non-dif fer ent af ter cre ation also.
The ef fect (world) is non-dif fer ent from the cause (Brah man) be -
cause it is ex is tent in the cause, iden ti cally even, prior to its man i fes -
ta tion, though in time it is pos te rior.
A thing which does not ex ist in an other thing by the self of the lat -
ter is not pro duced from that other thing. For in stance, oil is not pro -
duced from sand. We can get oil from the ground nut be cause it ex ists
in the seed, though in la tency, but not from sand, be cause it does not

ex ist in it. The ex is tence is the same both in the world and in Brah -
man. As ev ery thing ex ists in Brah man, so it can come out of it.
Brah man is in all time nei ther more nor less than that which is.
So the ef fect also (the world) is in all time only that which is. That
which is, is one only. Hence the ef fect is non-dif fer ent from the cause.

If it be said that on ac count of (the ef fect) be ing de scribed as
that which is not, (the ef fect does) not (ex ist be fore cre ation),
we re ply ‘not so’, be cause the term ‘that which is not’ de notes
an other char ac ter is tic or at trib ute (as is seen from the lat ter
part of the text.

**Asadvyapadesat:** on ac count of its be ing de scribed as non-ex is tent;
**Na:** not; **Iti chet:** if it be said; **Na:** no: **Dharmantarena:** by an other
at trib ute or char ac ter is tic; **Vakyaseshat:** from the lat ter part of the
text or pas sage, be cause of the com ple men tary pas sage.

The ar gu ment that the world had no ex is tence be fore cre ation is
re futed.
From the word ‘Asat’, lit er ally mean ing non-ex is tence, in the
Sruti, it may be ar gued that be fore cre ation the world had no ex is -
tence. But that ar gu ment can not stand as the lat ter part of the same
text uses ep i thets other than “non-ex is tent” to de scribe the con di tion
of the world be fore cre ation. We un der stand from this that the world
was ex is tent be fore cre ation. This is es tab lished by rea son ing also
be cause some thing can not come out of noth ing and also by clear
state ments on other texts of Sruti. “ _Asad va idam agra asit_ ”––Asat
was this ver ily in the be gin ning (Tait. Up. II-7-1).
“ _Asat eva agre asit_ ”––This uni verse was at first but non-ex is -
tent. Asat in deed was this in the be gin ning. From it ver ily pro ceeded
the Sat (Chh. Up. III.19.1). The lat ter part of the pas sage is
“Tatsadasit” (That was ex is tent). The word ‘non-ex is tent’ (Asat) uni -
verse does not cer tainly mean ab so lute non-ex is tence, but that the
uni verse did not ex ist in a gross, dif fer en ti ated state. It ex isted in an
ex tremely sub tle unmanifested state. It was not dif fer en ti ated. It had
not yet de vel oped name and form. The world was pro jected. Then it
be came gross, and de vel oped name and form. You can get the
mean ing if you go through the lat ter part of the pas sage ‘It be came ex -
is tent.’ ‘It grew’.
It is ab surd to say that non-ex is tence (Asat) ex isted. There fore,
Sat means man i fest, i.e. hav ing name and form, whereas Asat sim ply
means fine, sub tle and unmanifested. ‘Asat’ re fers to an other at trib -
ute of the ef fect, namely non-man i fes ta tion. The words Sat and Asat

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 163

re fer to two at trib utes of one and the same ob ject, namely to its gross
or man i fested con di tion and sub tle or unmanifested con di tion.

Asat in deed was this in the be gin ning. From it ver ily pro ceeded the
Sat. That made it self its Self. There fore, it is said to be self-made.
The words “Asat made it self its Self” clears up any doubt as to
the real mean ing of the word “that”. If the word “Asat” meant ab so lute
non-ex is tence, then there will be a con tra dic tion in terms, be cause
non-ex is tence can never make it self the Self of any thing. The word
“Asit” or “was” be comes ab surd when ap plied to “Asat” be cause ab -
so lute non-ex is tence can never be said to ex ist and ‘was’ means ‘ex -
isted’. An ab so lute non-ex is tence can have no re la tion with time past
or pres ent. Fur ther, it can not have any agency also as we find in the
pas sage, “It made it self its Self.” Hence the word ‘Asat’ should be ex -
plained as a sub tle state of an ob ject.

**Yukteh sabdantaraccha** II.1.18 (152)
From rea son ing and from an other Sruti text (the same is clear.
This re la tion be tween cause and ef fect is es tab lished.)

**Yukteh:** from rea son ing; **Sabda-antarat:** from an other Sruti text;
**Cha:** and.

That the ef fect ex ists be fore its orig i na tion and is non-dif fer ent
from the cause fol lows from rea son ing and also from a fur ther scrip -
tural pas sage or an other text of the Vedas.
The same fact is clear from logic or rea son ing also. Oth er wise,
ev ery thing could have been pro duced from any thing. If non-be ing is
the cause, then why should there be an in ev i ta ble se quence? Why
should curds be pro duced from milk and not from mud? It is im pos si -
ble even within thou sands of years to bring about an ef fect which is
dif fer ent from its cause. Par tic u lar causes pro duce par tic u lar ef fects
only. The re la tion of cause and ef fect (e.g. the re la tion of mud and pot)
is a re la tion of iden tity. The cause of our think ing and say ing ‘the pot
ex ists’ is the fact that the lump of clay as sumes a par tic u lar form of a
neck, hol low belly, etc., while the ma te rial re mains as clay only. On
the con trary we think and say ‘the jar does not ex ist’, when the clay
pot is bro ken into piece. Hence ex is tence and non-ex is tence show
only their dif fer ent con di tions. Non-ex is tence in this con nec tion does
not mean ab so lute non-ex is tence. This is rea son ing or Yukti.
Just as an ac tor puts on many dis guises and is yet the same
man, so also the Ul ti mate Cause (Brah man) ap pears as these di -
verse ob jects and yet is the same.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 164
```

Hence the cause ex ists be fore the ef fects and is non-dif fer ent
from the ef fect.
The ef fect ex ists in the cause in an unmanifested state. It is
man i fested dur ing cre ation. That is all. An ab so lutely non-ex is tent
thing like the horns of a hare can never come into ex is tence. The
cause can not pro duce al to gether a new thing which was not ex ist ing
in it al ready.
Fur ther, we find from the well-known pas sage of the
Chhandogya Upanishad, “In the be gin ning, my dear, there was only
ex is tence, one with out a sec ond” (Chh. Up. VI-2-1), that the ef fect ex -
ists even be fore cre ation and is non-dif fer ent from its cause.
The au thor now gives some il lus tra tions in or der to con firm the
doc trine that ef fect is iden ti cal with the cause.

not seen as a cloth till they are wo ven. Even so, the ef fect is in the
cause and is iden ti cal with the cause. In the folded state you can not
make out whether it is a cloth or any thing else. But when it is spread
out you can clearly know that is a cloth. In the state of dis so lu tion
(Pralaya) the world ex ists in a seed state or po ten tial con di tion in
Brah man.
There are no names and forms. The uni verse is in an un dif fer en -
ti ated or unmanifested state. It takes a gross form af ter cre ation. The
names and forms are dif fer en ti ated and man i fested.
As a piece of cloth is not dif fer ent from the threads, so the ef fect
(world) is not dif fer ent from its cause (Brah man).
The word “Cha” (and) of the Su tra shows that other il lus tra tions
like the seed and the tree may also be given here.
When the cloth is folded, you do not know of what def i nite length
and width it is. But when it is un folded you know all these par tic u lars.
You also know that the cloth is not dif fer ent from the folded ob ject. The
ef fect, the piece of cloth, is unmanifested as long as it ex ists in its
cause, i.e., the threads. It be comes man i fest and is clearly seen on
ac count of the op er a tions of shut tle, loom, weaver, etc.
The con clu sion is that the ef fect is not dif fer ent from the cause.

**Yatha cha pranadi** II.1.20 (154)

And as in the case of the dif fer ent Pranas or Vi tal airs.

**Yatha:** as; **Cha:** and; **Pranadi:** in the case of Pranas or vi tal airs.

An other il lus tra tion in sup port of Su tra 17 is pre sented.
The word ‘Cha’ (and) in the Su tra shows that the last il lus tra tion
of the piece of cloth and the pres ent one of life func tions should be
read to gether as one il lus tra tion.
When the five dif fer ent vi tal airs are con trolled by the prac tice of
Pranayama, they merge in the chief Prana, the cause which reg u lates
breath ing. Mere life only is main tained. All other func tions such as
bend ing and stretch ing of the limbs etc., are stopped. This shows that
the var i ous vi tal airs, the ef fects, are not dif fer ent from their cause, the
chief Prana. The dif fer ent vi tal airs are only mod i fi ca tions of the chief
or Mukhyaprana. So is the case with all ef fects. They are not dif fer ent
from the cause.
Thus it is es tab lished that the ef fect, the world, is iden ti cal with
its cause, Brah man. There fore, by know ing Brah man ev ery thing is
known. As the whole world is an ef fect of Brah man and non-dif fer ent
from it, the prom ise held out in the scrip tural text ‘what is not heard is
heard, what is not per ceived is per ceived, what is not known is known’
(Chh. Up. VI.I.3) is ful filled.

The dis cus sions on the re la tion of the world to Brah man have
been fin ished now. The ques tion of the re la tion of the in di vid ual soul
to Brah man is be ing raised by way of an ob jec tion in this Su tra.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 166
```

In the pre vi ous Adhikarana, the one ness of the ef fect (world)
with its cause (Brah man) has been es tab lished.
In this Su tra, the op po nent or Purvapakshin raises an ob jec tion.
He says, that if Brah man is the cause of the world, there is in ap pro pri -
ate ness in that view be cause the scrip ture de scribes Jiva as be ing
Brah man and, there fore, he will not cause harm to him self such as
birth, death, old age, dis ease, by get ting into the per son of the body. A
be ing which is it self ab so lutely pure, can not take this al to gether im -
pure body as form ing part of its Self.
The scrip ture de clares the other, i.e., the em bod ied soul to be
one with Brah man. “That is the Self”. “Thou art That. O Svetaketu”
(Chh. Up. VI.8.7.). By stat ing that the in di vid ual soul is one with Brah -
man, there arises room for find ing out a fault in the wis dom of Brah -
man, that He is not do ing good to Him self by cre at ing suf fer ing and
pain on ac count of re peated births and deaths for Him self. Will any
one do what is harm ful and un pleas ant to him self? Will he not re mem -
ber that he cre ated the world? Will he not de stroy it as the cause of his
suf fer ing? Brah man would have cre ated a very beau ti ful world where
ev ery thing would have been pleas ant for the in di vid ual soul with out
the least pain or suf fer ing. That is not so. Hence, Brah man is not the
cause of the world as Vedanta main tains. As we see that what would
be ben e fi cial is not done, the hy poth e sis of the world hav ing come out
of an In tel li gent Cause (Brah man) is not ac cept able.

Adhikam tu bhedanirdesat II.1.22 (156)

But (Brah man, the Cre ator, is) soemthing more (than the
in di vid ual soul) on ac count of the state ment in the Srutis (of
dif fer ence) be tween the in di vid ual soul (and Brah man).

**Adhikam:** some thing more, greater than the Jiva; **Tu:** but;
**Bhedanirdesat:** be cause of the point ing out of dif fer ences on
ac count of the state ment of dif fer ence. ( **Bheda:** dif fer ence; **Nirdesat:**
be cause of the point ing out).

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 21 is re futed.
The word ‘tu’ (but) re futes the ob jec tion of the last Su tra. It dis -
cards the Purvapaksha.
The Cre ator of the world is Om nip o tent. He is not the im pris -
oned, em bod ied soul. The de fects men tioned in the pre vi ous Su tra
such as do ing what is not ben e fi cial and the like do not at tach to that
Brah man be cause as eter nal free dom is His char ac ter is tic na ture,
there is noth ing ei ther ben e fi cial to be done by Him or non-ben e fi cial
to be avoided by Him. More over, there is no ob struc tion to His knowl -
edge and power, be cause He is Om ni scient and Om nip o tent. He is a
mere wit ness. He is con scious of the un re al ity of the world and Jiva.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 167
```

He has nei ther good nor evil. Hence the cre ation of a uni verse of good
and evil by Him is un ob jec tion able.
The Jiva is of a dif fer ent na ture. The de fects men tioned in the
pre vi ous Su tra be long to the Jiva only, so long as he is in a state of ig -
no rance. The Srutis clearly point out the dif fer ence be tween the in di -
vid ual soul and the Cre ator in texts like “Ver ily, the Self is to be seen,
to be heard, to be re flected and to be med i tated upon” (Bri. Up. II.4.5).
All these dif fer ences are imag i nary or il lu sory on ac count of ig no -
rance. When the in di vid ual soul at tains knowl edge of Brah man, he re -
mem bers his iden tity with Brah man. Then the whole phe nom e non of
plu ral ity which springs from wrong knowl edge dis ap pears. There is
nei ther the em bod ied soul nor the cre ator.
This Brah man is su pe rior to the in di vid ual soul. The in di vid ual
soul is not the cre ator of this uni verse. Hence the ob jec tion raised in
Su tra 21 can not stand. The pos si bil ity of faults cling ing to Brah man is
ex cluded.
Though Brah man as sumes the form of the in di vid ual soul, yet
He is not ex hausted thereby. But He re mains as some thing more, i.e.,
as the con trol ler of the in di vid ual soul. This is ob vi ous from the dis tinc -
tion pointed out in the Sruti. Hence there is no oc ca sion for the fault
spo ken of in Su tra 21.

**Aí_m{Xdƒ VXZwnn{Îm...&>**

**Asmadivaccha tadanupapattih** II.1.23 (157)

And because the case is similar to that of stones, etc.,
(produced from the same earth), the objection raised is
untenable.

**Asmadivat:** like stone, etc.; **Cha:** and; **Tat anupapattih:** its
untenability, unreasonableness, impossibility; ( **Tat:** of that; **Tasya:** its,
of the objection raised in Sutra 21).

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 21 is fur ther re futed.
The ob jec tor may say that Brah man which is Knowl edge and
Bliss and un change able can not be the cause of a uni verse of di ver -
sity, of good and bad. This ob jec tion can not stand, be cause we see
that from the same ma te rial earth, stones of dif fer ent val ues like di a -
monds, lapis laz uli, crys tals and also or di nary stones are pro duced.
From the seeds which are placed in one and the same ground var i ous
plants are seen to spring up, such as san dal wood and cu cum bers,
which show the great est dif fer ence in their leaves, blos soms, fruits,
fra grance, juice, etc. One and the same food pro duces var i ous ef fects
such as blood, hair, nail, etc. So also, one Brah man also may con tain
in it self the dis tinc tion of the in di vid ual selves and the high est Self and
may pro duce var i ous ef fects. So also from Brah man which is Bliss
and Knowl edge, a world of good and evil can be cre ated.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 168
```

Hence the ob jec tion imag ined by oth ers against the doc trine of
Brah man be ing the cause of the world can not be main tained.
More over, the scrip ture de clares that all ef fects have their or i gin
in speech only. The dream ing man is one but the dream pic tures are
many. These are hinted at by the word ‘Cha’ of the Su tra.

Upasamharadarsanadhikaranam: Topic 8 (Sutras 24-25)
Brahman is the cause of the world
```
**Cng§hmaXe©ZmÞo{V MoÞ jrad{ÕŸ&**

**Upasamharadarsananneti chenna kshiravaddhi** II.1.24 (158)

If you object that Brahman without instruments cannot be the
cause of the universe, because an agent is seen to collect
materials for any construction, (we say) no, because (it is) like
milk (turning into curds).

**Upasamharadarsanat:** because collection of materials is seen; **Na:**
not; **Iti chet:** if it be said; **Na:** no; **Kshiravat:** like milk; **Hi:** because, as.

**Darsanat:** because of the seeing; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Vat:** like, has the
force of an instrumental case here. (See Sutra of Panini, _Tena tulyam
kriya_ etc.)

An ob jec tion that ma te ri als are nec es sary for the cre ation of the
world is re futed.
Though Brah man is de void of ma te ri als and in stru ments, He is
yet the cause of the uni verse. If you ob ject that an ef fi cient cause like
a pot ter is seen to use in stru ments and there fore Brah man can not be
the ma te rial cause as also the ef fi cient cause, we re ply that it is like
milk turn ing into curds.
The ob jec tor, Purvapakshin, says: Work men are found to col lect
ma te ri als to do their works. Brah man also must have re quired ma te ri -
als where with to cre ate the world, but there was no other thing than
Brah man be fore cre ation. He is one with out a sec ond. He could not
have brought out His work of cre ation as there was no ma te rial, just
as a pot ter could not have made his pots, if there had been no ma te ri -
als like earth, wa ter, staffs, wheels, etc., be fore him.
This ob jec tion has no force. Ma te ri als are not re quired in ev ery
case. For in stance, milk is it self trans formed into curd. In milk no ex -
ter nal agency is needed to change it into curds. If you say that in the
case of milk heat is nec es sary for cur dling the milk, we re ply that heat
merely ac cel er ates the pro cess of cur dling. The cur dling oc curs
through the in her ent ca pac ity of the milk. You can not turn wa ter into
curds by the ap pli ca tion of heat. The milk’s ca pa bil ity of turn ing into
curd is merely com pleted by the co op er a tion of aux il iary means.
Brah man man i fests Him self in the form of the uni verse by His in -
scru ta ble power. He sim ply wills. The whole uni verse co mes into be -
ing. Why can not the Om nip o tent In fi nite Brah man cre ate the world by

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 169
```

His will-power (Sankalpa) alone with out in stru ments and ex tra ne ous
aids?
Brah man is Om nip o tent and In fi nite. Hence no ex tra ne ous aid
or in stru ment is nec es sary for Him to cre ate this world.
Thus Sruti also de clares “There is no ef fect and no in stru ment
known of Him, no one is seen like unto or better. His high power is re -

vealed as man i fold and in her ent, act ing as force and knowl edge”
(Svet. Up. VI. 8).
There fore, Brah man, al though one only, is able to trans form
Him self as this uni verse of di verse ef fects with out any in stru ment or
ex tra ne ous aid, on ac count of His in fi nite pow ers.

**Xodm{XdX{n bmoHo$Ÿ&**

**Devadivadapi loke** II.1.25 (159)
(The case of Brahman creating the world is) like that of gods
and other beings in the world (in ordinary experience).

**Devadivat:** like gods and others (saints); **Api:** even, also; **Loke:** in
the world.

The word ‘vat’ has the force of sixth case here. An other read ing
is ‘Iti’ (thus), in stead of ‘Api’.
The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 24 is brought for ward.
An ob jec tor (or Purvapakshin) says: ‘The ex am ple of milk turn -

ing into curds is not ap pro pri ate as it is an in sen tient thing. In tel li gent
agents like pot ters be gin to do their work af ter pro vid ing them selves
with a com plete set of in stru ments. How then can it be said that Brah -
man, an in tel li gent Be ing, can do His work of cre ation with out any
aux il iary, with out the aid of any con stit u ent ma te ri als?’ We re ply, ‘like

gods and oth ers.’
We see also that in the world gods and sages cre ate par tic u lar
things such as pal aces, char i ots, etc., by force of will, with out ex ter nal
aid. Why can not the Om nip o tent Cre ator cre ate the world by His
will-power (Sat Sankalpa) or His in fi nite power of Maya?
Just as the spi der pro jects out of it self the threads of its web, just
as the fe male crane con ceives with out a male from hear ing the sound

of thun der, just as the lo tus wan ders from one lake to an other with out
any means of con vey ance so also the in tel li gent Brah man cre ates the
world by it self with out ex ter nal in stru ments or aid.
The case of Brah man is dif fer ent from that of pot ters and sim i lar
agents. No ex tra ne ous means is nec es sary for Brah man for cre ation.

There is lim i ta tion in the cre ation of pots. The cre ation of Brah man
can not be lim ited by the con di tions ob served in the cre ation of pots.
Brah man is Om nip o tent.

Either the consequence of the entire (Brahman undergoing

**Kritsnaprasaktih:** possibility of the entire (Brahman being modified);

that Brahman is without parts; **Va:** or, otherwise.

( **Kritsna:** entire, full, total; complete; **Prasaktih:** exigency,

**Kopat:** contradiction, violation, incongruity, stultification; **Va:** or.)

An ob jec tion that Brah man is not the ma te rial cause of the
world, is raised in the Su tra.
The ob jec tor says that if the en tire Brah man be comes the world,
then no Brah man will re main dis tinct from the world and that if a part
of Brah man be comes the world, the scrip tural texts which de clare
Brah man to be with out parts will be vi o lated.
If Brah man is with out parts and yet the ma te rial cause of the uni -
verse, then we have to ad mit that the en tire Brah man be comes mod i -
fied into the uni verse. Hence there will be no Brah man left but only the
ef fect, the uni verse. Fur ther, it will go against the dec la ra tion of the
Sruti text that Brah man is un change able.
If on the con trary it is said that a por tion of Brah man only be -
comes the uni verse, then we will have to ac cept that Brah man is
made up of parts, which is de nied by the scrip tural texts. The pas -
sages are, {ZîH$b§ {ZpîH«$`§ emÝV§ {ZadÚ§ {ZaÄOZ_²Ÿ& —“He who is with out parts, with -
out ac tions, tran quil, with out fault, with out taint” (Svet. Up. VI.19). {Xì`mo

nor fine” (Bri. Up. III.8-8). All these pas sages deny the ex is tence of
parts or dis tinc tions in Brah man.
What ever has form is per ish able and so Brah man also will be -
come per ish able or non-eter nal.
Also if the uni verse is Brah man, where is the need for any com -
mand to see (Drastavya)? The texts which ex hort us to strive to see

```

Brah man be come pur pose less, be cause the ef fects of Brah man may
be seen with out any ef fort and apart from them no Brah man ex ists. Fi -
nally, the texts which de clare Brah man to be un born are con tra dicted
thereby.
Hence Brah man can not be the ma te rial cause of the uni verse.
This ob jec tion is re futed in the next Su tra.

( **Sabda:** word, revelation, Sruti; **Mula:** foundation.)

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 25 is re futed.
The en tire Brah man does not be come the world be cause the
scrip ture de clares so, and Brah man can be known only through the
source of scrip ture.
The word ‘tu’ (but) dis cards the ob jec tion. It re futes the view of
the pre vi ous Su tra. These ob jec tions have no force be cause we rely
on the Sruti or scrip ture.
The en tire Brah man does not un dergo change, al though the
scrip tures de clare that the uni verse takes its or i gin from Brah man.
Sruti says, “one foot (quar ter) of Him is all be ings, and three feet are
what is im mor tal in heaven.” (nmXmo@ñ` {dœm ^yVm{Z {ÌnmXñ`m_¥V§ {X{dŸ&)
More over, we are one with Brah man in deep sleep as stated by
the scrip ture. How could that hap pen if the en tire Brah man has be -

Fur ther, the scrip ture de clares that we can real ise Brah man in

world?
More over, the pos si bil ity of Brah man be com ing the ob ject of
per cep tion by means of the senses is de nied while its ef fects may
thus be per ceived.
The scrip tural texts de clare Brah man to be with out parts. Then
how could a part be come man i fest? We re ply that it is only the re sult
of Avidya.
Are there two moons if on ac count of a de fect of your vi sion you

Brah man rests ex clu sively on the Srutis or scrip tures. The sa -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 172
```

Brah man. Hence we will have to ac cept the dec la ra tions of the Srutis
with out the least hes i ta tion.
The scrip tural texts de clare on the one hand that not the en tire
Brah man changes into its ef fects and on the other hand, that Brah -
man is with out parts. Even cer tain or di nary things such as gems,
spells, herbs, etc., pos sess pow ers which pro duce di verse op po site
ef fects on ac count of dif fer ence of time, place, oc ca sion and so on.
No one is able to find out by mere re flec tion the num ber of these pow -
ers, their fa vour ing con di tions, their ob jects, their pur poses, etc., with -
out the help of in struc tion. When such is the case with or di nary things,
how much more im pos si ble is it to con ceive with out the aid of scrip -
ture the true na ture of Brah man with its pow ers un fath om able by
thought? The scrip ture de clares “Do not ap ply rea son ing to what is
un think able.”
Hence the Srutis or the scrip tures alone are au thor ity in mat ters
supersensuous. We will have to ac cept that both these op po site
views ex pressed by the scrip tures are true, though it does not stand
to rea son. It must be re mem bered that the change in Brah man is only
ap par ent and not real. Brah man some how ap pears as this uni verse,
just as rope ap pears as the snake. Brah man be comes the ba sis of the

There is no rea son to find fault with the doc trine that there can

In the dream state, we see such di verse and won der ful cre ation in
our selves. “There are no char i ots in that dream ing state, no horses,
no roads, but he him self cre ates char i ots, horses and roads” (Bri. Up.
IV.3.10), and yet the in di vid ual char ac ter of the self is not af fected by
it. This does not lessen or af fect our in teg rity of be ing.
In or di nary life too mul ti ple cre ations, el e phants, horses and the
like are seen to ex ist in gods, ma gi cians, with out any change in them -
selves, with out in ter fer ing with the unity of their be ing. Sim i larly, a

The sec ond ‘cha’ (also, and) is in or der to in di cate that when
such won der ful things are be lieved by us as the dreams, the pow ers
of the gods and the ma gi cians, why should we hes i tate to be lieve in

**Svapaksha:** in one’s own view; **Doshat:** because of the defects;

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 26 is fur ther re futed.
The ar gu ment raised in Su tra 26 can not stand, be cause the
same charge can be lev elled against the ob jec tor’s side also.
The ob jec tion raised by you will equally ap ply to your doc trine
that the form less (impartite) In fi nite Pradhana or Prakriti void of sound
and other qual i ties cre ates the world. The Sankhyas may say, “We do
not men tion that our Pradhana is with out parts. Pradhana is only a
state of equi poise of the three Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.
Pradhana forms a whole con tain ing the three Gunas as its parts. We
re ply that such a partiteness does not re move the ob jec tion in hand
since Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are each of them equally impartite.
Each Guna by it self as sisted by the two other Gunas, con sti -
tutes the ma te rial cause of that part of the world which re sem bles it in
its na ture. Hence, the ob jec tion lies against the Sankhya view like -
wise.
As rea son ing is al ways un sta ble, if you are in clined to be lieve in
the Pradhana’s be ing in fact ca pa ble of par ti tion, then it fol lows that
the Pradhana can not be eter nal.
Let it then be said that the var i ous pow ers of the Pradhana to
which the va ri ety of its ef fects are point ing are its parts. Well, we re ply,
those di verse po ten cies are ad mit ted by us also as we see the cause
of the world in Brah man. The same ob jec tion ap plies also to your
atomic the ory.
The same ob jec tions can be lev elled against the doc trine of the
world hav ing orig i nated from at oms. The atom is not made up of parts.
When one atom com bines with an other atom, it must en ter into com -
bi na tion with its whole ex tent with an other. It can not en ter into par tial
con tact with an other. There will be en tire interpenetration. Hence,
there could be no fur ther in crease in the size. The com pound of two
at oms would not oc cupy more space than one atom. The re sult of the

con junc tion would be a mere atom. But if you hold that the atom en -
ters into the com bi na tion with a part only, that would go against the
as sump tion of the at oms hav ing no parts.
If the Pradhana is taken to be the cause of the uni verse as the
Sankhyas main tain, in that case also the view of the Sankhyas will be
equally sub ject to the ob jec tions raised against the Vedantic view of
Brah man as the cause of the uni verse, as the Pradhana, too, is with -
out parts. As for the propounder of the Brah man-the ory, he has al -
ready re futed the ob jec tion di rected against his own view.

**Sarvopeta cha taddarsanat** II.1.30 (164)

And (Brahman is) endowed with all (powers), because it is seen
(from the scriptures).

**Sarvopeta:** endowed with all powers, all-powerful; **Cha:** also, and;
**Taddarsanat:** because it is seen (from the scriptures).

( **Sarva:** all; **Upeta:** endowed with, possessed with; **Tat:** that, the
possession of such powers.)

The ob jec tion in Su tra 26 is fur ther re futed.
Brah man is Om nip o tent as is clear from the scrip tures. Hence it
is per fectly within His pow ers to man i fest Him self as the world and to
be at the same time be yond it.
The ob jec tor (Purvapakshin) says: We see that men who have a
phys i cal body are en dowed with pow ers. But Brah man has no body.
Hence He can not be in the possesssion of such pow ers.
This has no force. This Su tra gives proof of Brah man be ing en -
dowed with Maya Sakti. Var i ous scrip tural texts de clare that Brah man
pos sesses all pow ers. “He to whom all ac tions, de sires, all odours, all
tastes be long, he who em braces all this, who never speaks, and is
never sur prised” (Chh. Up. III.14.4). “He who de sires what is true and
imag ines what is true” (Chh. Up. VIII.7.1). “He who knows all in its to -
tal ity and cog nises all in its de tails” (Mun. Up. I.1.9). “By the com mand
of that Im per ish able, O Gargi, sun and moon stand apart” (Bri. Up.
III.8.9). “The great Lord is the Mayin (the Ruler of Maya)” (Svet. Up.
IV.10) and other sim i lar pas sages.

**Vikaranatvanneti chet taduktam** II.1.31 (165)

If it be said that because (Brahman) is devoid of organs, (it is)
not (able to create), (we reply that) this has already been
explained.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 1 175

**Vikaranatvat:** because of want of organs of action and perception;

**Na:** not; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Tat:** that, that objection; **Uktam:** has been

explained or answered.

An other ob jec tion to Brah man be ing the cause of the world is re -
futed.
The op po nent says: “Brah man is des ti tute of or gans. Hence,
though He is all-pow er ful, He can not cre ate.” Scrip ture de clares, “He
is with out eyes, with out ears, with out speech, with out mind” (Bri. Up.
III.8.8). Fur ther Srutis say, “Not this, Not this.” This pre cludes all at trib -
utes. We know from Mantras and Arthavadas, etc., that the gods and
other in tel li gent be ings, though en dowed with all pow ers, are able to
cre ate be cause they are fur nished with bodily in stru ments of ac tion.
The Su tra con sists of an ob jec tion and its re ply. The ob jec tion
por tion is ‘ _Vikaranatvanneti chet_ ’ and the re ply por tion is ‘ _Taduktam_ .’
Even though Brah man has no eyes or ears, or hands or feet, He
is Om nip o tent. That has been ex plained above in Sutras II.1.4 and
II.1.25. He as sumes dif fer ent forms through Avidya or Maya. With re -
spect to Brah man, the scrip ture alone is the au thor ity, but not rea son.
The scrip ture de clares that Brah man, though des ti tute of or gans,
pos sesses all ca pac i ties and pow ers, “Grasps with out hands, moves
swiftly with out feet, sees with out eyes and hears with out ears” (Svet.
Up. III.19). Though Brah man is de void of all at trib utes, yet He is en -
dowed with all pow ers through Avidya or Maya.

**Na prayojanavattvat** II.1.32 (166)

(Brahman is) not (the creator of the universe) on account of
(every activity) having a motive.

**Na:** not (i.e. Brahman cannot be the creator); **Prayojana-vattvat:** on

account of having motive.

An other ob jec tion to Brah man be ing the cause of the world is
raised.
The ob jec tor says: “In this world, ev ery body does a work with
some mo tive. He does any work to sat isfy his de sire. There is also a
scrip tural pas sage that con firms this re sult of com mon ex pe ri ence,
‘Ver ily, ev ery thing is not dear that you may love ev ery thing, but that
you may love the Self, there fore ev ery thing is dear’ (Bri. Up. II.4.5).
But Brah man is all-full, self-suf fi cient and self-con tained. He has
noth ing to gain by the cre ation. There fore He can not en gage Him self
in such a use less cre ation. Hence, Brah man can not be the cause of
the uni verse.”

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 176
```

The un der tak ing of cre at ing this world with all its de tails is in -
deed a weighty one. If Brah man de sires cre ation to ful fil a wish, then
He can not be an eter nally happy, per fect be ing with no un ful filled de -
sires. If He has no de sire, then He will not wish to cre ate and so there
will be no cre ation. It can not be said that He cre ates with out pur pose,
like a sense less man in a state of frenzy. That would cer tainly con tra -
dict His Om ni science.
Hence the doc trine of the cre ation pro ceed ing from an in tel li -
gent Be ing (Brah man) is un ten a ble.

**bmoH$dÎmw brbmH¡$dë`_²Ÿ&**

**Lokavattu lilakaivalyam** II.1.33 (167)

But (Brahman’s creative activity) is mere sport, such as is seen
in the world (or ordinary life).

**Lokavat:** as in the world, as in ordinary life; **Tu:** but; **Lilakaivalyam:**
mere pastime.

( **Lila:** sport, play; **Kaivalyam:** merely; **Lilamatram:** mere pastime.)

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 32 is re plied to.
The word ‘tu’ (but) re moves the above obejction.
Brah man has cre ated the world not out of any de sire or mo tive.
It is sim ply His pas time, pro ceed ing from His own na ture, which is in -
her ent in and in sep a ra ble from Him, as it is seen also in the world that
some times a rich man or a prince, does some ac tion with out any mo -
tive or pur pose, sim ply out of a sport ive im pulse. Just as chil dren play
out of mere fun, or just as men breathe with out any mo tive or pur pose,
be cause it is their very na ture, just as a man full of cheer ful ness when
awak en ing from sound sleep, be gins to dance about with out any ob -
jec tive, but from mere ex u ber ance of spirit, so also Brah man en gages
Him self in cre at ing this world not out of any pur pose or mo tive, but out
of sport ing or Lila or play pro ceed ing from His own na ture.
Al though the cre ation of this uni verse ap pears to us a weighty
and dif fi cult un der tak ing, it is mere play to the Lord, whose power is
in fi nite or lim it less.
If in or di nary life we may pos si bly by close scru tiny de tect some
sub tle mo tive even for sportful ac tion (play ing at a game of balls is not
al to gether mo tive less, be cause the prince gets some plea sure by the
play), we can not do so with re gard to the ac tions of the Lord. The
scrip ture de clares that all wishes are ful filled in the Lord and that He is
all-full, self-con tained and self-suf fi cient.
It should not be for got ten how ever that there is no cre ation from
the stand point of the Ab so lute, be cause name and form are due to
Avidya or ig no rance and be cause Brah man and At man are re ally
one.

The op po nent again raises an ob jec tion. The the ory that Brah -

Hence this the ory is not a con gru ous one. This ob jec tion is re moved
by the fol low ing Su tra.

**Vaishamyanairghrinye na sapekshatvat
tatha hi darsayati** II.1.34 (168)

Partiality and cruelty cannot (be ascribed to Brahman) on
account of His taking into consideration (other reasons in that
matter viz., merit and demerit of the souls), for so (scripture)
declares.

**Vaishamya:** inequality, partiality; **Nairghrinye:** cruelty, unkindness;
**Na:** not (cannot be ascribed to Brahman); **Sapekshatvat:** because of
dependence upon, as it is dependent on something else, i.e., upon
the Karma of the souls; **Tatha:** so; **Hi:** because; **Darsayati:** the
scripture declares.

The ac cu sa tion that Brah man is par tial and cruel in His cre ation
of the world is re moved.

Some are cre ated poor, some rich. There fore Brah man or the
Lord is par tial to some. He makes peo ple suf fer. There fore He is
cruel. For these two rea sons Brah man can not be the cause of the
world. This ob jec tion is un ten a ble. The Lord can not be ac cused of in -
equal ity and cru elty, be cause en joy ment and suf fer ing of the in di vid -
ual soul are de ter mined by his own pre vi ous good and bad ac tions.
Sruti also de clares. “A man be comes vir tu ous by his vir tu ous deeds
and sin ful by his sin ful acts— _Punyo vai punyena karmana bhavati,
papah papena_ ” (Bri. Up. III.2.13).
The grace of the Lord is like rain which brings the po tency of
each seed to man i fest it self ac cord ing to its na ture. The va ri ety of pain
and plea sure is due to va ri ety of Karma.
The po si tion of the Lord is to be re garded as sim i lar to that of
Parjanya, the giver of rain. Parjanya is the com mon cause of the pro -
duc tion of rice, bar ley and other plants. The dif fer ence be tween the
var i ous spe cies is due to the di verse po ten ti al i ties ly ing hid den in the
re spec tive seeds. Even so, the Lord is the com mon cause of the cre -
ation of gods, men, etc. The dif fer ences be tween these classes of be -
ings are due to the dif fer ent merit be long ing to the in di vid ual souls.
Scrip ture also de clares, “The Lord makes him whom He wishes
to lead up from these worlds do a good ac tion. The Lord makes Him

```

whom He wishes to lead down do a bad ac tion” (Kau. Up. III.8). “A
man be comes good by good work, bad by bad work” (Bri. Up.
III.2.13). Smriti also de clares that the Lord metes out re wards and
pun ish ments only in con sid er ation of the spe cific ac tions of be ings. ‘I
serve men in the way in which they ap proach Me.’ (Bhagavad Gita
IV.11).

**Z H$_m©{d^mJm{X{V MoV² Z AZm{XËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Na karmavibhagaditi chet na anaditvat** II.1.35 (169)

If it be objected that it (viz., the Lord’s having regard to merit
and demerit) is not possible on account of the non-distinction
(of merit and demerit before creation), (we say) no, because of
(the world) being without a beginning.

**Na:** not; **Karmavibhagat:** because of the non-distinction of work
(before creation); **Iti chet:** if it be said, if it be objected in this way; **Na:**
no, the objection cannot stand; **Anaditvat:** because of
beginninglessness.

An ob jec tion against Su tra 34 is raised and re futed.
The Su tra con sists of two parts, viz., an ob jec tion and its re ply.
The ob jec tive por tion is ‘ _Na karmavibhagaditi chet_ ’ and the re ply por -
tion is ‘ _Na anaditvat_ ’.
An ob jec tion is raised now. The Sruti says, “Be ing only this was
in the be gin ning, one with out a sec ond.” There was no dis tinc tion of
works be fore cre ation of the world. There was only the ab so lutely
One Real Be ing or Brah man. The cre ation at the be gin ning of one
man as rich and of an other as poor and un happy can not cer tainly de -
pend on the re spec tive pre vi ous good or bad deeds. The first cre ation
must have been free from in equal i ties.
This ob jec tion can not stand. The cre ation of the world is also
with out a be gin ning. There was never a time that may be said to be an
ab so lute be gin ning. The ques tion of first cre ation can not arise. Cre -
ation and de struc tion of the world fol low ing each other con tin u ally by
ro ta tion is with out any be gin ning and end. The con di tion of in di vid ual
souls in any par tic u lar cy cle of cre ation is pre de ter mined by their ac -
tions in the pre vi ous cy cle.
It can not be said that there could be no Karma prior to cre ation,
which causes the di ver sity of cre ation, be cause Karma is Anadi
(beginningless). Cre ation is only the shoot from a pre-ex ist ing seed of
Karma.
As the world is with out a be gin ning, merit and in equal ity are like
seed and sprout. There is an un end ing chain of the re la tion of cause
and ef fect as in the case of the seed and the sprout. There fore, there
is no con tra dic tion pres ent in the Lord’s cre ative ac tiv ity.

**Upapadyate chapyupalabhyate cha** II.1.36 (170)

And (that the world—and also Karma—is without a beginning)

is reasonable and is also seen (from the scriptures).

**Upapadyate:** is proved by reasoning, is reasonable that it should be

so; **Cha:** and; **Api:** and, also, assuredly; **Upalabhyate:** is seen, is

found in Sruti or Scriptures; **Cha:** also, and.

Karma is Anadi (beginningless). This is log i cal and is sup ported
by scrip ture. By rea son ing also it can be de duced that the world must
be beginningless. Be cause, if the world did not ex ist in a po ten tial or
seed state, then an ab so lutely non-ex ist ing thing would be pro duced
dur ing cre ation. There is also the pos si bil ity of lib er ated per sons be -
ing re born again. Fur ther, peo ple would be en joy ing and suf fer ing
with out hav ing done any thing to de serve it. As there would ex ist no
de ter min ing cause of the un equal dis pen sa tion of plea sure and pain,
we should have to sub mit or as sert to the doc trine of re wards and
pun ish ments be ing al lot ted with out ref er ence to pre vi ous vir tues and
vi cious deeds. There will be ef fect with out a cause. This is cer tainly
ab surd. When we as sume ef fect with out a cause, there could be no
law at all with ref er ence to the pur pose or reg u lar ity of cre ation. The
Sruti de clares that cre ation is ‘Anadi’ (beginningless).
More over, mere Avidya (ig no rance) which is ho mo ge neous
(Ekarupa), can not cause the het er o ge ne ity of cre ation. It is Avidya di -
ver si fied by Vasanas due to Karma that can have such a re sult.
Avidya needs the di ver sity of in di vid ual past work to pro duce var ied
re sults. Avidya may be the cause of in equal ity if it be con sid ered as
hav ing re gard to de merit ac cru ing from ac tion pro duced by the men tal
sup pres sion of wrath, ha tred and other af flict ing pas sions.
The scrip tures also posit the ex is tence of the uni verse in for mer
cy cles or Kalpas in texts like, “The cre ator fash ioned the sun and the
moon as be fore” (Rig Veda Samhita, X-190-3). Hence par tial ity and
cru elty can not be as cribed to the Lord.

BRAHMA SUTRAS 180

An other rea son to prove that Brah man is the cause of the world
is brought for ward.
The ob jec tor says: Ma te rial cause un der goes mod i fi ca tion as
the ef fect. Such a cause is en dowed with the at trib utes. Brah man
can not be the ma te rial cause of the uni verse as He is attributeless.
This Su tra gives a suit able an swer to this ob jec tion.
There is no real change in Brah man but there is an ap par ent
mod i fi ca tion in Brah man on ac count of His in scru ta ble power of
Maya.
Brah man ap pears as this uni verse, just as rope ap pears as
snake. All the at trib utes needed in the cause for the cre ation (such as
Om nip o tence, Om ni science) are pos si ble in Brah man on ac count of
the power of Maya. Hence, Brah man is the ma te rial cause of this uni -
verse through ap par ent change. He is also the ef fi cient cause of this
uni verse.
There fore it is es tab lished that Brah man is the cause of the uni -
verse. The Vedantic sys tem founded upon the Upanishads is not
open to any ob jec tion. Thus it fol lows that the whole cre ation pro -
ceeds from Para Brah man.
In the Vedantic the ory as hith erto dem on strated, viz., that Brah -
man is the ma te rial and the ef fi cient cause of the world—the ob jec tion
al leged by our op po nents such as dif fer ence of char ac ter and the like
have been re futed by the great Teacher. He brings to a con clu sion the
sec tion prin ci pally de voted to strengthen his own the ory. The chief
aim of the next chap ter will be to re fute the opin ions held by other
teach ers.

INTRODUCTION

In the First Sec tion of the Sec ond Chap ter Brah man’s
creatorship of the world has been es tab lished on the au thor ity of the
scrip tures sup ported by logic. All ar gu ments against Brah man be ing
the cause of the uni verse have been re futed.
In the pres ent Sec tion the Sutrakara or the framer of the Sutras
ex am ines the the o ries of cre ation ad vanced by other schools of
thought in vogue in his time. All the doc trines of the other schools are
taken up for ref u ta tion through rea son ing alone with out ref er ence to
the au thor ity of the Vedas. Here he re futes by rea son ing the Mat ter
the ory or the Pradhana the ory of the Sankhya phi los o phy, the Atom
the ory of the Vaiseshika phi los o phy, the mo men tary and the Ni hil is tic
view of the Bud dhists, the Jain the ory of si mul ta neous ex is tence and
non-ex is tence, the Pasupata the ory of co or di nate du al ity and the ory
of en ergy un aided by in tel li gence.
It has been shown in the last Su tra of the First Sec tion of the
Sec ond Chap ter that Brah man is en dowed with all the at trib utes
through Maya, such as Om nip o tence, Om ni science, etc., for qual i fy -
ing Him to be the cause of the world.
Now in Sec tion 2 the ques tion is taken up whether the Pradhana
of the Sankhya phi los o phy can sat isfy all those con di tions.

SYNOPSIS
```
```
I
```
To put all things con cisely in a nut shell, Sri Vyasa Bhagavan re -
futes in this sec tion all the doc trines or the o ries prev a lent in his time
and in con sis tent with the Vedanta the ory; viz., (1) The Sankhya the -
ory of the Pradhana as the first cause. (2) Ref u ta tion of the ob jec tion
from the Vaiseshika stand point against the Brah man be ing the First
Cause. (3) Ref u ta tion of the Atomic the ory of the Vaiseshikas. (4) Ref -
u ta tion of the Bauddha Ide al ists and Ni hil ists. (5) Ref u ta tion of the
Bauddha Re al ists. (6) Ref u ta tion of the Jainas. (7) Ref u ta tion of the
Pasupata doc trine, that God is only the ef fi cient and not the ma te rial
cause of the world. (8) Ref u ta tion of the Pancharatra or the
Bhagavata doc trine that the soul orig i nates from the Lord, etc.
In the First Sec tion of the Sec ond Chap ter Brah man’s au thor -
ship of the world has been es tab lished on the au thor ity of the scrip -
tures sup ported by logic. The task of the Sec ond Pada or Sec tion is to
re fute by ar gu ments in de pend ent of Ve dic pas sages the more im por -
tant philo soph i cal the o ries con cern ing the or i gin of the uni verse which
are con trary to the Vedantic view.
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-10) is di rected against the Sankhyas. It
aims at prov ing that a non-in tel li gent first cause such as the Pradhana
of the Sankhyas is un able to cre ate and dis pose.
_Adhikaranas II and III:_ (Sutras 11-17) re fute the Vaiseshika doc -
trine that the world takes its or i gin from the at oms which are set in mo -
tion by the Adrishta.
_Adhikaranas IV and V:_ are di rected against var i ous schools of
Buddhistic phi los o phy.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Sutras 18-27) re futes the view of Buddhistic Re -
al ists who main tain the re al ity of an ex ter nal as well as an in ter nal
world.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 28-32) re futes the view of the
Vijnanavadins or Buddhistic Ide al ists, ac cord ing to whom Ideas are
the only re al ity. The last Su tra of the Adhikarana re futes the view of
the Madhyamikas or Sunyavadins (Ni hil ists) who teach that ev ery -
thing is void, i.e., that noth ing what so ever is real.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 33-36) re futes the doc trine of the Jainas.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 37-41) re futes the Pasupata school
which teaches that the Lord is not the ma te rial but only the ef fi cient or
op er a tive cause of the world.

```

_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Sutras 42-45) re futes the doc trine of the
Bhagavatas or Pancharatras.
**II**

In Sutras 1 to 10 the prin ci ple of Sankhya phi los o phy is fur ther
re futed by rea son ing. Pradhana or blind mat ter is in ert. It is in sen tient
or non-in tel li gent. There is me thod i cal ar range ment in the cau sa tion
of this world. Hence it is not rea son able to sup pose that blind mat ter
can have any in cli na tion for the cre ation of the world with out the help
of in tel li gence.
The Sankhya says that the in ert Pradhana may be come ac tive
of its own ac cord and spon ta ne ously pass into the state of the world
and un dergo mod i fi ca tion into in tel lect, ego ism, mind, Tanmatras,
etc., just as wa ter flows in rivers spon ta ne ously, rain from the clouds,
or milk from the ud der to the calf. This ar gu ment of the Sankhya is un -
ten a ble, be cause the flow ing of wa ter or milk is di rected by the in tel li -
gence of the Su preme Lord.
Ac cord ing to the Sankhyas, there is no ex ter nal agent to urge
Pradhana into ac tiv ity or re strain ing from ac tiv ity. Pradhana can work
quite in de pend ently. Their Purusha is al ways in ac tive and in dif fer ent.
He is not an agent. Hence the con ten tion that Pradhana in pres ence
of Purusha or Spirit ac quires a ten dency to wards ac tion or cre ation
can not stand.
The Sankhya ar gues that Pradhana is by it self turned into the
vis i ble world, just as grass eaten by a cow is it self turned into milk.
This ar gu ment is ground less as no such trans for ma tion is found on
the part of the grass eaten by the bull. Hence, also, it is the will of the
Su preme Lord that brings about the change, not be cause the cow has
eaten it. There fore Pradhana by it self can not be said to be the cause
of the world.
The Sankhya says that Purusha can di rect the Pradhana or in -
spire ac tiv ity in Pradhana though He has no ac tiv ity, just as a lame
man can move by sit ting on the shoul ders of a blind man and di rect
his move ments. The in de pend ent and blind Pradhana, in con junc tion
with the pas sive but in tel li gent Purusha, orig i nates the world. This ar -
gu ment also is un ten a ble be cause the per fect in ac tiv ity and in dif fer -
ence of Purusha and the ab so lute in de pend ence of Pradhana can not
be rec on ciled with each other.
The Pradhana con sists of three Gunas, viz., Sattva, Rajas and
Tamas. They are in a state of equi poise be fore cre ation. No Guna is
su pe rior or in fe rior to the other. The Purusha is al to gether in dif fer ent.
He has no in ter est in bring ing about the dis tur bance of equi lib rium of
the Pradhana. Cre ation starts when the equi poise is up set and one
Guna be comes more pre dom i nant than the other two. As there was in
the be gin ning of cre ation no cause for the dis tur bance of the state of

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 184
```

equi poise, it was not pos si ble for Pradhana to be trans formed into the
world.
Sutras 11 to 17 re fute the Atomic the ory of the Vaiseshika phi -
los o phy where the in di vis i ble min ute at oms are stated to be the cause
of the world. If an atom has any parts of an ap pre cia ble mag ni tude,
then it can not be an atom. Then it can be fur ther di vis i ble. If they are
with out parts of any ap pre cia ble mag ni tude, as they are so de scribed
in Vaiseshika phi los o phy, it is not pos si ble for such two partless at oms
to pro duce by their un ion a sub stance hav ing any mag ni tude. Hence
com pound sub stances can never be formed by the com bi na tion of at -
oms. There fore the Vaiseshika the ory of orig i na tion of the world from
in di vis i ble at oms is un ten a ble.
The in an i mate at oms can have no ten dency of them selves to
unite to gether and co here so as to form com pounds. Vaiseshikas
hold that the mo tion which is due to the un seen prin ci ple (Adrishta),
joins the at oms in which it re sides to an other atom. Adrishta is a la tent
force of the sum to tal of pre vi ous deeds which waits to bear fruit in the
fu ture. Thus the whole world orig i nates from at oms.
As Adrishta is in sen tient it can not act. It can not re side in the at -
oms. It must in here in the soul. If the la tent force or Adrishta be an in -
her ent prop erty of at oms, the at oms will al ways re main united. Hence
there will be no dis so lu tion and no chance for fresh cre ation.
If the two at oms unite to tally or per fectly the atomic state will
con tinue as there will be no in crease in bulk. If in part, then at oms will
have parts. This is against the the ory of the Vaiseshikas. Hence, the
the ory of the Vaiseshikas that the world is caused by com bi na tion of
at oms is un ten a ble.
The atomic the ory in volves an other dif fi culty. If the at oms are by
na ture ac tive, then cre ation would be per ma nent. No Pralaya or dis -
so lu tion could take place. If they are by na ture in ac tive, no cre ation
could take place. The dis so lu tion would be per ma nent. For this rea -
son also, the atomic doc trine is un ten a ble.
Ac cord ing to the Vaiseshika phi los o phy, the at oms are said to
have col our etc. That which has form, col our etc., is gross, and im per -
ma nent. Con se quently, the at oms must be gross and im per ma nent.
This con tra dicts the the ory of the Vaiseshikas that they are min ute
and per ma nent.
If the re spec tive at oms of the el e ments also pos sess the same
num ber of qual i ties as the gross el e ments, then the atom of air will
have one qual ity, an atom of earth will have four qual i ties. Hence an
atom of earth which pos sesses four qual i ties will be big ger in size. It
would not be an atom any lon ger. Hence the Atom the ory of the
Vaiseshikas on the cau sa tion of the world does not stand to rea son in
any way. This Atom the ory is not ac cepted by the Vedas.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 185
```

Sutras 18 to 32 re fute the Buddhistic the ory of momentarism
(Kshanikavada) and Ni hil ism (Sunyavada). The Vaiseshikas are the
Re al ists (Sarvastitvavadins). They ac cept the re al ity of both the out -
side world and the in side world con sist ing re spec tively of ex ter nal ob -
jects and con scious ness and feel ings. The Sautrantikas are the
ide al ists (Vijnanavadins). They hold that thought alone is real. They
main tain that ideas only ex ist and the ex ter nal ob jects are in ferred
from the ideas. The Yogacharas hold that ideas alone are real and
there is no ex ter nal world cor re spond ing to these ideas. The ex ter nal
ob jects are un real like dreamy ob jects. The Madhymikas main tain
that even the ideas them selves are un real and there is noth ing that
ex ists ex cept the void (Sunyam). They are the Ni hil ists or
Sunyavadins who hold that ev ery thing is void and un real. All of them
agree that ev ery thing is mo men tary. Things of the pre vi ous mo ment
do not ex ist in the next mo ment.
Ac cord ing to the Bud dhists, at oms and con scious ness are both
in an i mate. There is no per ma nent in tel li gence which can bring about
the ag gre ga tion or which can guide the at oms to unite into an ex ter nal
thing or to form a con tin u ous men tal phe nom ena. Hence the doc trine
of this school of Bauddhas is un ten a ble.
Ne science etc., stand in a causal re la tion to each other merely.
They can not be made to ac count for the ex is tence of the ag gre gates.
Ac cord ing to the Buddhistic the ory, ev ery thing is mo men tary. A thing
of the pres ent mo ment van ishes in the next mo ment, when its suc ces -
sor man i fests. At the time of the ap pear ance of a sub se quent thing,
the pre vi ous thing al ready van ishes. Hence it is im pos si ble for the
pre vi ous thing to be the cause of the sub se quent thing. Con se quently
the the ory is un ten a ble.
The Bud dhists main tain that ex is tence orig i nates from non -ex is -
tence be cause they hold that the ef fect can not man i fest with out the
de struc tion of the cause, the tree can not ap pear un til the seed is de -
stroyed. We al ways per ceive that the cause sub sists in the ef fect as
the thread sub sists in the cloth. Hence the Buddhistic view is in cor -
rect, un rea son able and in ad mis si ble.
Even the pass ing of cause into ef fect in a se ries of suc ces sive
states like ne science, etc., can not take place un less there is a co or di -
nat ing in tel li gence. The Bud dhists say that ev ery thing has only a mo -
men tary ex is tence. Their school can not bring about the si mul ta neous
ex is tence of two suc ces sive mo ments. If the cause ex ists till it passes
into the stage of ef fect, the the ory of mo men tary ex is tence
(Kshanikavada) will van ish.
Ac cord ing to the Buddhistic view, sal va tion or free dom is at -
tained when ig no rance is de stroyed. Ig no rance is the false idea of
per ma nency in things which are mo men tary.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 186
```

The ig no rance can be an ni hi lated by the adop tion of some
means such as pen ance, knowl edge, etc., (con scious de struc tion), or
it may de stroy it self (spon ta ne ity). But both the al ter na tives are de fec -
tive. Be cause this an ni hi la tion of ig no rance can not be at tained by the
adop tion of pen ance or the like, be cause the means like ev ery other
thing is also mo men tary ac cord ing to the Buddhistic view and is there -
fore, not likely to pro duce such an ni hi la tion. An ni hi la tion can not take
place of its own ac cord, for in that case all Buddhistic in struc tions, the
dis ci plines and meth ods of med i ta tion for the at tain ment of sal va tion
will be use less.
The Bud dhists do not re cog nise the ex is tence of Akasa. They
re gard Akasa as a non-en tity. This is un rea son able. Akasa has the
qual ity of sound. It is also a dis tinct en tity like earth, wa ter, etc. If
Akasa be a non-en tity, then the en tire world would be come des ti tute
of space. Scrip tural pas sages de clare “Akasa sprang from At man.”
Hence Akasa is a real thing. It is a Vastu (ex ist ing ob ject) and not
non-ex is tence.
If ev ery thing is mo men tary, the experiencer of some thing must
also be mo men tary. But the experiencer is not mo men tary be cause
peo ple have the mem ory of past ex pe ri ences. Mem ory can take place
in a man who has pre vi ously ex pe ri enced it. He is con nected with at
least two mo ments. This cer tainly re futes the the ory of mo men tari -
ness.
A non-en tity has not been ob served to pro duce en tity. There fore
it does not stand to rea son to sup pose non-en tity to be the cause. The
world which is a re al ity is stated by the Bud dhists to have arisen out of
non-en tity. This is ab surd. A pot is never found to be pro duced with out
clay. If ex is tence can come out of non-ex is tence, then any thing may
come out of any thing, be cause non-en tity is one and the same in all
cases. A jack tree may come out of a mango seed. If an ex ist ing thing
can arise out of noth ing, then an in dif fer ent and lazy man may also at -
tain sal va tion with out ef forts. Eman ci pa tion may be at tained like a
wind fall. Rice will grow even if the farmer does not cul ti vate his field.
The Vijnanavadins say that the ex ter nal things have no ob jec -
tive re al ity. Ev ery thing is an idea with out any re al ity cor re spond ing to
it. This is not cor rect. The ex ter nal ob jects are ac tu ally per ceived by
senses of per cep tion. The ex ter nal world can not be non-ex is tent like
the horns of a hare.
The Bud dhist Ide al ists say that per cep tion of the ex ter nal world
is like the dream. This is wrong. The con scious ness in dream de -
pends on the pre vi ous con scious ness in the wake ful state, but the
con scious ness in the wake ful state does not de pend on any thing else
but on the ac tual per cep tion by the sense. Fur ther, the dream ex pe ri -
ences be come false as soon as one wakes up.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 187
```

The Bud dhist Ide al ists hold that though an ex ter nal thing does
not ac tu ally ex ist, yet its im pres sions do ex ist, and from these im pres -
sions di ver si ties of per cep tion and ideas like chair, tree arise. This is
not pos si ble, as there can be no per cep tion of an ex ter nal thing which
is it self non-ex is tent. If there be no per cep tion of an ex ter nal thing,
how can it leave an im pres sion?
The men tal im pres sions can not ex ist be cause the ego which re -
ceives im pres sions is it self mo men tary in their view.
The Sunyavada or Ni hil ism of the Bud dhists which as serts that
noth ing ex ists is fal la cious, be cause it goes against ev ery method of
proof, viz., per cep tion, in fer ence, tes ti mony or scrip ture and anal ogy.
Sutras 33 to 36 re fute the Jaina the ory. Ac cord ing to the Jaina
the ory, ev ery thing is at once ex ist ing and non-ex ist ing. Now this view
can not be ac cepted, be cause in one sub stance it is not pos si ble that
con tra dic tory qual i ties should ex ist si mul ta neously. No one ever sees
the same ob ject to be hot and cold at the same time. Si mul ta neous
ex is tence of light and dark ness in one place is im pos si ble.
Ac cord ing to the Jaina doc trine heaven and lib er a tion may ex ist
or may not ex ist. We can not ar rive at any def i nite knowl edge. There is
no cer tainty about any thing.
The Jainas hold that the soul is of the size of the body. As the
bod ies of dif fer ent classes of crea tures are of dif fer ent sizes, the soul
of a man tak ing the body of an el e phant on ac count of his past deeds
will not be able to fill up the body of an el e phant. The soul of an el e -
phant will not have suf fi cient space in the body of an ant. The sta bil ity
of the di men sions of the soul is im paired. The Jaina the ory it self falls
to the ground.
Sutras 37 to 41 re fute the the ory of the fol low ers of the Pasupata
sys tem. The fol low ers of this school re cog nise God as the ef fi cient or
the op er a tive cause. They re cog nise the pri mor dial mat ter as the ma -
te rial cause of the world. This view is con trary to the view of the Sruti
or Vedanta where Brah man is stated to be both the ef fi cient and the
ma te rial cause of the world. Hence, the the ory of Pasupatas can not
be ac cepted.
God, in their view, is pure, with out at trib utes, and ac tiv ity. Hence
there can be no con nec tion be tween Him and the in ert pri mor dial
mat ter. He can not urge and reg u late mat ter to work. To say that God
be comes the ef fi cient cause of the world by putt ing on a body is also
fal la cious be cause all bod ies are per ish able. God is eter nal ac cord ing
to the Pasupatas, and so can not have a per ish able body and be come
de pend ent on this phys i cal in stru ment.
If it be said that the Lord rules the Pradhana, etc., just as the Jiva
rules the senses which are also not per ceived, this can not be; be -
cause the Lord also would ex pe ri ence plea sure and pain, hence
would for feit His God head. He would be sub ject to births and deaths,

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 188
```

and de void of Om ni science. He will lose all His su prem acy. This sort
of God is not ad mit ted by the Pasupatas.
Sutras 42 to 45 re fute the doc trine of the Bhagavatas or the
Pancharatra doc trine. Ac cord ing to this school, the Lord is the ef fi -
cient as well as the ma te rial cause of the uni verse. This is in quite
agree ment with the Srutis. An other part of the sys tem is open to ob -
jec tion. The doc trine that Sankarshana or the Jiva is born of
Vaasudeva, Pradyumna or mind from Sankarshana, Aniruddha or
Ahamkara from Pradyumna is in cor rect. Such cre ation is not pos si -
ble. If there is such birth, if the soul be cre ated it would be sub ject to
de struc tion and hence there could be no lib er a tion.
The Bhagavatas may say that all the Vyuhas or forms are
Vaasudeva, the Lord hav ing in tel li gence, Lord ship, strength, power,
etc., and are free from faults and im per fec tions. In this case there will
be more than one Isvara or Lord. This goes against their own doc trine
ac cord ing to which there is only one real es sence, the holy
Vaasudeva. Fur ther, there are also in con sis ten cies or man i fold con -
tra dic tions in the sys tem. There are pas sages which are con tra dic tory
to the Vedas. It con tains words of de pre ci a tion of the Vedas. Hence,
the doc trine of the Bhagavatas can not be ac cepted.

Rachananupapattyadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-10)
Refutation of the Sankhyan theory of the
Pradhana as the cause of the world
```
**aMZmZwnnÎmoü ZmZw_mZ_²Ÿ&**

**Rachananupapattescha nanumanam** II.2.1 (172)
That which is inferred (by the Sankhyas, viz., the Pradhana),
cannot be the cause (of the world) because (in that case it is)
not possible (to account for the) design or orderly arrangement
(found in the creation).

**Rachana:** construction, the design in creation; **Anupapatteh:** on
account of the impossibility; **Cha:** and; **Na:** not; **Anumanam:** that
which is inferred, what is arrived at by inference, i.e., the Pradhana of
the Sankhyas.

An ar gu ment is brought for ward to the ef fect that the Pradhana
of the Sankhyas is not the cause of the world.
The main ob ject of the Vedanta Sutras is to show the pur pose of
the rev e la tion of truth in the Vedas. They aim also at re fut ing the
wrong doc trines in the other sys tems of phi los o phy. In the pre vi ous
por tion the doc trine of the Sankhyas has been re futed here and there
on the au thor ity of the scrip tures. Sutras 1-10 re fute it through log i cal
rea son ing.
Pradhana or blind mat ter is in ert. It is an in sen tient en tity. It does
not pos sess the in tel li gence that is needed for cre at ing such a mul ti -

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 189
```

far i ous, elab o rate, won der ful, or derly, me thod i cal and well-de signed
uni verse as this. It can not bring into be ing the man i fold or der li ness of
the cos mos. No one has ever seen a beau ti ful pal ace con structed by
the for tu itous com ing to gether of bricks, mor tar, etc., with out the ac -
tive co op er a tion of in tel li gent agents like the ar chi tects, ma sons and
the rest. Hence, Pradhana can not be the cause of this world.
Clay can not change it self into a pot.
The rea son ing that Pradhana is the cause of the world be cause
it has in it plea sure, pain, dull ness, which are found in the world is not
valid, be cause it is not pos si ble for an in sen tient en tity to cre ate the
won der ful, or derly uni verse. More over, how do you say that plea sure
and pain and dull ness are found in the out side world? The ex ter nal
ob jects are a fac tor in plea sure and pain which are in ter nal ex pe ri -
ences. More over, there can be plea sure and pain even ir re spec tive of
the ex ter nal ob jects. How can you as cribe them to an in sen tient en tity
(Achetana)?
Phys i cal ob jects like flow ers, fruits, etc., no doubt have the pres -
ence in them of the qual ity of pro duc ing plea sure. But the feel ing of
plea sure is al to gether an in ter nal feel ing. We can not say that flow ers
and fruits have the na ture of plea sure in them, though they ex cite
plea sure in man. Plea sure is al to gether an at trib ute of the soul and
not of mat ter or Pradhana. Hence, mat ter or Pradhana can not be said
to have the qual ity of plea sure, etc.

**àd¥ÎmoüŸ&**

**Pravrittescha** II.2.2 (173)

And on account of the (impossibility of) activity.

**Pravritteh:** because of the activity, of a tendency; **Cha:** and (it has the
force of ‘only’ here).

This is an ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1.
Pradhana (blind mat ter) can not be the cause of the world, be -
cause it is also im pos si ble for it to have an in cli na tion for cre ation.
How does Pradhana in a state of equi lib rium of its three Gunas
be come dy namic and cre ative? It can not dis turb its own equi poise.
The de sire or ten dency to cre ate can not be as cribed to the in ert
Pradhana. The in ert char iot can not move by it self. It is only the in tel li -
gent char i o teer who moves the char iot by di rect ing the move ments of
the horse. Mud by it self is never seen to cre ate a jar with out the
agency of an in tel li gent pot ter. From what is seen we de ter mine what
is not seen. We pro ceed from the known to the un known. How then do
you prove that Pradhana which is in sen tient is self-mov ing? Hence
the in ert Pradhana can not be the cause of the uni verse, be cause the
ac tiv ity that is nec es sary for the cre ation of the uni verse would be im -
pos si ble in that case. There must be a di rec tive in tel li gent Be ing or
En tity for that pur pose.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 190
```

The ac tiv ity must be at trib uted to the di rec tive in tel li gence rather
than to the in ert mat ter or Pradhana. That which sets Pradhana or
mat ter in mo tion is the real agent. Ev ery ac tiv ity is seen as the re sult
of an in tel li gent agent. In ert mat ter or Pradhana there fore has no
agency. Mat ter or Pradhana has no self-ini ti ated ac tiv ity of its own.
The ob jec tor may say “I do not see Chetana (soul) ac tive and
that I see only the ac tiv ity of the body.” We re ply that there is no ac tiv -
ity with out the soul.
He may again say that the soul, be ing pure con scious ness, can -
not have ac tiv ity. We re ply that the soul can in duce ac tiv ity, though not
self-ac tive, just as a lode stone or mag net though unmoving can make
iron move. A ma te rial ob ject though fixed causes ac tiv ity in our
senses.
The ob jec tor may again say that as the soul is one and in fi nite,
there is no pos si bil ity of cau sa tion of ac tiv ity. We re ply that it causes
ac tiv ity in the names and forms cre ated by Maya ow ing to Avidya.
Hence, mo tion can be rec on ciled with the doc trine of an in tel li -
gent First Cause but not with the doc trine of a non-in tel li gent first
cause (Pradhana of the Sankhyas).

**n`mo@å~wdƒoV² VÌm@{nŸ&**

**Payo’mbuvacchet tatra’pi** II.2.3 (174)

If it be said (that the Pradhana moves or spontaneously
modifies herself into the various products) like milk or water
(without the guidance of any intelligence), (we reply that) there
also (it is due to intelligence).

**Payo’mbuvat:** like milk and water; **Chet:** if; **Tatra:** there, in those
cases; **Api:** even, also. ( **Payah:** milk; **Ambuvat:** like water.)

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
If the ob jec tor says that there could be self-ac tiv ity of na ture as
in milk or wa ter, we re ply that even then there is the op er a tion of an in -
tel li gent agent.
The Sankhya says that the in ert Pradhana may be come ac tive
of its own ac cord and un dergo mod i fi ca tion into in tel lect, ego ism,
mind, Tanmatra, etc., just as wa ter flows in rivers spon ta ne ously, rain
from the clouds or milk from the ud der to the calf.
This is re futed by the lat ter part of Su tra ‘ _Tatra Api_ ’, even there.
Even the flow ing of wa ter or milk is di rected by the in tel li gence of the
Su preme Lord. This we in fer from the ex am ple of char iot, etc. We may
not see the in tel li gent driver of the char iot, but we in fer his ex is tence
from the mo tion of the car.
The scrip tures also say, “He who dwells in the wa ter, who rules
the wa ter from within” (Bri. Up. III.7.4). “By the com mand of that

Akshara, O Gargi! some rivers flow to the east” (Bri. Up. III.8.9). Ev -
ery thing in this world is di rected by the Lord.
Fur ther the cow is an in tel li gent crea ture. She loves her calf, and
makes her milk flow by her wish. The milk is in ad di tion drawn forth by
the suck ing of the calf. The flow of wa ter de pends on the down ward
slop ing of the earth.

**ì`{VaoH$mZdpñWVoümZnojËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Vyatirekanavasthiteschanapekshatvat** II.2.4 (175)
And because (the Pradhana) is not dependent (on anything),
there being no external agent besides it (it cannot be active).

**Vyatirekanavasthiteh:** There being no external agency besides it;
**Cha:** and also; **Anapekshatvat:** because it is not dependent.
( **Vyatireka:** an external agent; **Anavasthiteh:** from non-existence, as
it does not exist.)

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
Ac cord ing to the Sankhyas, there is no ex ter nal agent to urge
Pradhana into ac tiv ity, or re strain from ac tiv ity. Their Purusha is in dif -
fer ent, nei ther moves to, nor re strains from, ac tion. He is not an
agent. He is un re spon sive to the first stim u lus for start ing the pro cess
of cre ation. Hence, there is no agency to dis turb the pri mor dial equi -
lib rium. There fore, the Pradhana of the Sankhyas can not be the First
Cause of the world.
The state in which the three Gunas are in a state of equi poise is
called Pradhana by the Sankhyas. Ac cord ing to the Sankhyas, no
con trol ling sen tient power op er ates on the Pradhana. Purusha is
static and qui es cent.
There fore, Pradhana may evolve in one way now and in an other
way af ter wards or may not evolve at all, as it is not con trolled by any
di rect ing and rul ing In tel li gence. But the Su preme Lord is Om ni scient
and Om nip o tent. He has per fect con trol over Maya. He can cre ate or
not cre ate as He pleases.
The Pradhana of the Sankhyas is in ert, so it can not of it self start
to be ac tive; or when it is set in mo tion it can hardly stop to be ac tive of
it self. Hence, the Sankhyas can not ex plain cre ation and dis so lu tion
when there is no di rect ing or rul ing in tel li gence. All other prin ci ples
are only ef fects of the Pradhana. There fore, they can not ex er cise any
in flu ence on it. Hence, the the ory of the Sankhyas is self-con tra dic -
tory.

**Anyatrabhavaccha na trinadivat** II.2.5 (176)

And (it can) not (be said that the Pradhana modifies itself
spontaneously) like grass, etc., (which turn into milk), because
of its absence elsewhere (than in the female animals).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 192
```

**Anyatra:** elsewhere, in the other case, elsewhere than in cows;

**Abhavat:** because of the absence; **Cha:** and, also; **Na:** not;

**Trinadivat:** like the grass etc.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
The word ‘cha’, and, has the force of ‘only’.
The ob jec tor says that as grass be comes milk, so Pradhana
may evolve into the world. But does grass be come milk of its own
power? No. If so, try to pro duce milk from grass. A cow alone con verts
grass into milk. Does a bull do so?
The spon ta ne ous mod i fi ca tion of the Pradhana is not pos si ble.
Grass is not changed into milk spon ta ne ously. It is con verted into milk
only when eaten by cows but not by the bulls. Here also it is the will of
the Su preme Lord that brings about the change, not be cause the cow
has eaten it.
The il lus tra tion or anal ogy is use less. It can not stand. The ar gu -
ment of the Sankhyas is not sound. Hence, the Pradhana’s un der go -
ing mod i fi ca tion of it self can not be ac cepted. The spon ta ne ous
mod i fi ca tion of Pradhana can not be proved from the in stances of
grass and the like.

**Aä`wnJ_o@ß`Wm©^mdmV²Ÿ&**

**Abhyupagame’pyarthabhavat** II.2.6 (177)

Even if we admit (the Sankhya position with regard to the
spontaneous modification of the Pradhana, it cannot be the
cause of the universe) because of the absence of any purpose.

**Abhyupagame:** accepting, admitting, taking for granted; **Api:** even;

**Artha:** purpose; **Abhavat:** because of the absence.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
Even though we ad mit for the sake of ar gu ment that the
Pradhana is spon ta ne ously ac tive, it will lead to a con tra dic tion in
their phi los o phy. If the Pradhana is spon ta ne ously ac tive, if it is ca pa -
ble of an in her ent ten dency for mod i fi ca tion, mo tion or change, its ac -
tiv ity can not have any pur pose. This will con tra dict the view of the
Sankhyas that the mod i fi ca tion of the Pradhana is for the ex pe ri ence
or en joy ment (Bhoga) and re lease of the soul (Moksha).
There is no en joy ment to be en joyed by the ever-per fect
Purusha (or Soul). If he could en joy, how could he ever be come free
from en joy ment? He is al ready free. He is al ready in a state of be at i -
tude. As He is per fect, He can have no de sire.
The in sen tient Pradhana can not have a de sire to evolve. So the
sat is fac tion of a de sire can not be con sid ered as the pur pose of ac tiv -
ity of the Pradhana. If you say that evo lu tion must be pos tu lated be -
cause cre ative power would be come in op er a tive oth er wise, we re ply
that in that case cre ative power will be al ways op er a tive and there

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 193
```

could be no at tain ment of free dom from it by the at tain ment of be at i -
tude.
It is, there fore, im pos si ble to main tain that the Pradhana be -
comes ac tive for the pur pose of the soul. It can not be the cause of the
uni verse.

**Purushasmavaditi chet tathapi** II.2.7 (178)

If it be said (that the Purusha or Soul can direct or move the
Pradhana) as the (lame) man can direct a blind man, or as the
magnet (moves the iron), even then (the difficulty cannot be
overcome).

**Purusha:** a person; **Asma:** a lodestone, a magnet; **Vat:** like; **Iti:** thus;
**Chet:** if; **Tathapi:** even then, still.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
The Sankhyas say that Purusha can di rect the Pradhana or in -
spire ac tiv ity in Pradhana, though He has no ac tiv ity, just as a lame
man can move by sit ting on the shoul ders of a blind man and di rect
his move ments or just as a mag net at tracts iron. But these il lus tra -
tions are not apt. A lame man speaks and di rects the blind man. The
blind man, though in ca pa ble of see ing, has the ca pac ity of un der -
stand ing those in struc tions given by the lame man and act ing upon
them. But Purusha is per fectly in dif fer ent. He has no kind of ac tiv ity at
all. Hence, He can not do that with re gard to the Pradhana.
More over, the lame and the blind are both con scious en ti ties
and the iron and the mag net are both in sen tient mat ter. Con se -
quently, the in stances given are not to the point. Ac cord ing to the
Sankhyas the Pradhana is in de pend ent. Hence, it is not right to say
that it de pends on the prox im ity of the Purusha for its ac tiv ity, just as
the iron de pends on the mag net for its mo tion. A mag net at tracts
when the iron is brought near. The prox im ity of the mag net to the iron
is not per ma nent. It de pends on a cer tain ac tiv ity and the ad just ment
of the mag net in a cer tain po si tion. But no one brings the Purusha
near Pradhana. If Purusha is al ways near, then cre ation will be eter -
nal. There will be no lib er a tion at all.
The Purusha and the Pradhana are al to gether sep a rate and in -
de pend ent. Pradhana is non-in tel li gent, in ert and in de pend ent.
Purusha is in tel li gent and in dif fer ent. No one else (a third prin ci ple)
ex ists to bring them to gether. Hence there can be no con nec tion be -
tween them.
There could be no cre ative ac tiv ity at all ac cord ing to the doc -
trine of the Sankhyas. If there could be such ac tiv ity, there could be no
fi nal re lease as the cause of cre ation could never cease.
In Vedanta, Brah man which is the cause of the uni verse is in dif -
fer ent but He is en dowed with at trib utes and ac tiv ity through Maya.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 194
```

He is char ac ter ised by non-ac tiv ity in her ent in His own na ture and at
the same time by mov ing power in her ent in Maya. So He be comes
the Cre ator. He is in dif fer ent by na ture and ac tive by Maya. Hence,
His cre ative power is well ex plained. He is su pe rior to the Purusha of
the Sankhyas.

**A{“ËdmZwnnÎmoüŸ&**

**Angitvanupapattescha** II.2.8 (179)

And again (the Pradhana cannot be active) because the
relation of principal (and subordinate matter) is impossible
(between the three Gunas).

**Angitvanupapatteh:** on account of the impossibility of the relation of
principal (and subordinate); **Cha:** and, also. ( **Angitva:** the relation of
being the principal, being preponderant; **Anupapatteh:** on account of
the impossibility and unreasonableness).

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
The Pradhana has been de fined to be the equi lib rium of the
three Gunas. The Pradhana con sists of three Gunas, viz., Sattva,
Rajas and Tamas. Three Gunas are in de pend ent of each other. They
are in a state of equi poise be fore cre ation. In the state of Pradhana no
Guna is su pe rior or in fe rior to the other. Ev ery one of them is equal to
the other and con se quently the re la tion of sub or di nate and prin ci pal
could not ex ist then. The Purusha is al to gether in dif fer ent. He has no
in ter est in bring ing about the dis tur bance of equi lib rium of the
Pradhana. Cre ation starts when the equi poise is up set and one Guna
be comes more pre dom i nant than the other two. As there ex ists no ex -
tra ne ous prin ci ple to stir up the Gunas, the pro duc tion of the Great
Prin ci ple and the other ef fects which would re quire for its op er a tive
cause a non-bal anced state of the Gunas is im pos si ble. Equi poise
can not be dis turbed with out any ex ter nal force. The Gunas are ab so -
lutely in de pend ent when they are in a state of equi lib rium. They can -
not take of them selves a sub sid iary po si tion to an other Guna with out
los ing their in de pend ence. Hence, cre ation would be im pos si ble.
This Su tra says that such pre pon der ance is not pos si ble. The
Sankhyas can not ex plain why should one Guna pre pon der ate over
the other. Hence, on ac count of the im pos si bil ity of such pre pon der -
ance of one over the other Gunas, Pradhana can not be ac cepted to
be the cause of the world.

**AÝ`WmZw{_Vm¡ M ke{º${d`moJmV²Ÿ&**

**Anyathanumitau cha jnasaktiviyogat** II.2.9 (180)

Even if it be inferred otherwise on account of the Pradhana
being devoid of the power of intelligence (the other objections
to the Pradhana being the cause of the universe remain in
force).

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 195
```

**Anyatha:** otherwise, in other ways; **Anumitau:** if it be inferred, in
case of inference; **Cha:** even, and; **Jnasakti:** power of intelligence;
**Viyogat:** because of being destitute of, because of dissociation.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con tin ued.
Even if the ob jec tor pos tu lates such power of mod i fi ca tion as
be ing in her ent in Pradhana, the in ap pro pri ate ness will con tinue be -
cause of the insentiency or non-in tel li gence of the Pradhana.
The Sankhya says: We do not ac knowl edge the Gunas to be
char ac ter ised by ab so lute in de pend ence, irrelativity and
unchangeableness. We in fer the char ac ter is tics of the Gunas from
those of their ef fects. We pre sume that their na ture must be such as to
make the pro duc tion of the ef fects pos si ble. The Gunas have some
char ac ter is tics, dif fer ent at trib utes and mys te ri ous pow ers in her ent in
them like unstability. Con se quently the Gunas them selves are able to
en ter into a state of in equal ity, even while they are in a state of equi -
poise. Even in that case we re ply, the ob jec tions stated above which
were founded on the im pos si bil ity of an or derly ar range ment of the
world, etc., re main in force on ac count of the Pradhana be ing de void
of the power of in tel li gence. As Pradhana is in sen tient it has not the
power of self-con scious ness. Be ing thus des ti tute of it, it has not the
idea of any plan or de sign. It can not say as an in tel li gent en tity would
say, “Let me cre ate the world in such and such a way.” A house can
never be built by mere bricks and mor tar with out the su per vi sion and
ac tive agency of the ar chi tect and ma sons. Even so, cre ation never
pro ceeds from dead mat ter or Pradhana. With out the di rec tive ac tion
of in tel li gence, the Gunas, how ever won der ful in their pow ers and at -
trib utes, can not of them selves cre ate the uni verse.
On ac count of lack of in tel li gence the ob jec tions, founded on de -
sign etc., in the uni verse and that it would lead to con tin u ous cre ation,
come in the way of ac cept ing the Pradhana as the cause of the uni -
verse (Vide Sutras 1, 4 and 7).

**{dà{VfoYmƒmg_ÄOg_²Ÿ&**

**Vipratishedhacchasamanjasam** II.2.10 (181)

And morever (the Sankhya doctrine) is objectionable on
account of its contradictions.

**Vipratishedhat:** because of contradiction; **Cha:** also, and;
**Asamanjasam:** inconsistent, objectionable, not harmonious,
untenable.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is con cluded.
Fur ther, the Sankhya doc trine is in con sis tent be cause there are
var i ous con tra dic tions in the Sankhya phi los o phy. Some times the
senses are said to be eleven and again they are said to be seven. It
some times says that the Tanmatras come from Mahat and some -
times that they come from Ahamkara. Some times it says that there

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 196
```

are three Antahkaranas. Some times it says that there is only one
Antahkarana.
More over, their doc trine con tra dicts Sruti which teaches that the
Lord is the cause of the uni verse, and Smriti based on Sruti. For these
rea sons also the Sankhya sys tem is ob jec tion able. It can not be ac -
cepted.
Here the Sankhya again brings a coun ter-charge. He says “You
also have got such in ap pro pri ate ness in your doc trine.” He asks
whether if Brah man is cause and ef fect, there could be any lib er a tion
from ef fects and whether scrip ture af firm ing lib er a tion will not be come
use less. He ar gues “fire can not be come free from heat and light or
wa ter free from waves. Only when there is sep a rate ness of cause and
ef fect, there can be any mean ing in lib er a tion.”
We re ply that even the ob jec tor must ad mit that Purusha be ing
by na ture pure, can not be dis turbed and that dis tur bance is due to
Avidya and is not ab so lutely real. That is our po si tion too. But you give
Avidya a state of per ma nence. Con se quently even if Purusha gets
free from it, there is no surety that such sep a ra tion will be per ma nent.
We pos tu late only one Be ing. All ef fects are only rel a tive and can not,
there fore, af fect the ab so lute re al ity.

**Mahaddirghavadva hrasvaparimandalabhyam** II.2.11 (182)

(The world may originate from Brahman) as the great and the
long originate from the short and the atomic.

**Mahat dirghavat:** like the great and the long; **Va:** or;
**Hrasvaparimandalabhyam:** from the short and the atomic.

The atomic the ory of the Vaiseshikas that form less, in di vis i ble
at oms en ter into the com po si tion of the world is now re futed.
The sage Kanada is the founder of the Vaiseshika phi los o phy.
He holds all ob jects which have any shape or form as per ish able and
they are all made of min ute, in di vis i ble, form less and im mu ta ble par ti -
cles known as at oms (Anu). These at oms are con sid ered to be the
cause of the world. The at oms are of four kinds, viz., the at oms of
earth, the at oms of wa ter, the at oms of fire and the at oms of air. These
at oms ex ist dis tinct from one an other with out any shape or form. At
the be gin ning of cre ation, one atom (a monad) unites with an other
and forms a dyad, an ag gre gate of two at oms. The dyad (dvyanu)
unites with an other atom and forms a triad, an ag gre gate of three at -
oms, and so on. Thus a vis i ble uni verse is formed.
The Vaiseshikas ar gue thus: The qual i ties which in here in the
sub stance which con sti tutes the cause pro duces qual i ties of the

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 197
```

same kind in the sub stance which forms the ef fect. White cloth is pro -
duced from a cloth of a dif fer ent col our. Con se quently, when the in tel -
li gent Brah man is taken as the cause of the uni verse, we should find
in tel li gence in her ent in the ef fect also, viz., the uni verse. But this is not
so. Hence, the in tel li gent Brah man can not be the cause of the uni -
verse.
The Sutrakara or the au thor of the Sutras shows that this rea -
son ing is fal la cious on the ground of the sys tem of Vaiseshikas them -
selves.
The Sankhya phi los o phy has been re futed in Sutras 1-10. Now
the Vaiseshika sys tem is taken up in Sutras 11-17 and re futed. The in -
con sis tency in the orig i na tion of an ag gre gate of the three and of four
at oms from the un ion of mo nads and of dyads of the Vaiseshika is like
the in con sis tency in the orig i na tion of the world from the in sen tient
Pradhana of Sankhya. If the atom has any parts of an ap pre cia ble
mag ni tude, then it can not be an atom. Then it can be fur ther di vis i ble.
If they are with out parts of any ap pre cia ble mag ni tude, as they are so
de scribed in Vaiseshika phi los o phy, it is not pos si ble for such two
partless at oms to pro duce by their un ion a sub stance hav ing any
mag ni tude. The same is the case with three at oms and so on. Hence,
com pound sub stances can never be formed by the com bi na tion of at -
oms. There fore, the Vaiseshika the ory of orig i na tion of the world upon
in di vis i ble at oms is un ten a ble.
Ac cord ing to the Vaiseshika phi los o phy, two ul ti mate at oms
(Parimandalas or Paramanus) be come a dou ble atom (Dvyanuka or
Hrasva) on ac count of Adrishta, etc. But the atomic na ture of the ul ti -
mate atom is not found in the Dvyanuka which is small. Two
Dvyanukas form a Chaturanuka (qua dru ple atom) which has not the
char ac ter is tics of small ness but be comes lon ger and big ger. If the ul -
ti mate atom can cre ate some thing which is con trary to the atom, what
is the in ap pro pri ate ness in Brah man which is Knowl edge and Bliss
cre at ing the in sen tient and non-in tel li gent world full of mis ery? Just as
the atomic na ture of the ul ti mate atom is not found in the later com bi -
na tions which have other traits, so also the Chaitanya or in tel li gence
of Brah man is not found in the world.
The ul ti mate con di tion of the world is atomic, ac cord ing to the
Vaiseshika sys tem. The at oms are eter nal. They are the ul ti mate
cause of the uni verse. The uni verse ex ists in the atomic state in the
state of Pralaya or dis so lu tion. An atom is in fin i tes i mal. A dyad is min -
ute and short. Chaturanuka or qua dru ple atom is great, and long.
If two at oms which are spher i cal can pro duce a dyad which is
min ute and short but which has not got the spher i cal na ture of the
atom, if the dyads which are short and min ute can pro duce a
Chaturanuka which is great and long but which has not got the mi -
nute ness and short ness of the dyad, it is quite ob vi ous that all the

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 198
```

qual i ties of the cause are not found in the ef fect. So it is quite pos si ble
that the in tel li gent, bliss ful Brah man can be the cause of a world
which is non-in tel li gent and full of suf fer ing.

**Paramanujagadakaranatvadhikaranam: Topic 3 (Sutras 12-17)**
_Refutation of the atomic theory of the Vaiseshikas_
The ob jec tion against the view of Vedanta has been an swered
in the pre vi ous Su tra. Now the Vaiseshika sys tem is re futed.

**C^`Wm{n Z H$_m©VñVX^md...Ÿ&**

**Ubhayathapi na karmatastadabhavah** II.2.12 (183)
In both cases also (in the cases of the Adrishta, the unseen
principle inhering either in the atoms or the soul) the activity
(of the atoms) is not possible; hence negation of that (viz.,
creation through the union of the atoms).

**Ubhayatha:** in either case, in both ways, on both assumptions or
hypotheses; **Api:** also; **Na:** not; **Karma:** action, activity, motion; **Atah:**
therefore; **Tadabhavah:** absence of that, negation of that, i.e.,
negation of the creation of the world by union of atoms.

The ar gu ment against the Vaiseshika sys tem com menced in
Su tra 11 is con tin ued.
What is the cause that first op er ates on the ul ti mate at oms?
Vaiseshikas hold that the mo tion which is due to the un seen prin ci ple
(Adrishta) joins the atom in which it re sides, to an other atom. Thus bi -
nary com pounds, etc. are pro duced and fi nally the el e ment of air.
Sim i larly fire, wa ter, earth, the body with its or gans are pro duced.
Thus the whole world orig i nates from at oms. The qual i ties of the bi -
nary com pounds are pro duced from the qual i ties in her ing in the at -
oms, just as the qual i ties of the cloth re sult from the qual i ties of the
threads. Such is the teach ing of the Vaiseshika sys tem of phi los o phy.
The mo tion in the at oms can not be brought about by the
Adrishta re sid ing in the at oms, be cause the Adrishta which is the re -
sul tant of the good and bad ac tions of the soul can not re side in the at -
oms. It must in here in the soul. The Adrishta re sid ing in the soul
can not pro duce mo tion in the atom. The mo tion of the atom is not ex -
plained on both these views. As Adrishta is in sen tient it can not act. As
Adrishta is in the soul, how can it op er ate in the at oms? If it can, such
op er a tion will go on for ever as there is no agency to con trol it. When
two at oms com bine do they unite per fectly or not? If they unite to tally,
if there is to tal interpenetration, the atomic state will con tinue as there
will be no in crease in bulk. If in part, then at oms will have parts. This is
against the the ory of the Vaiseshikas. More over, if they com bine
once, there can not be sep a ra tion or dis so lu tion. Adrishta will be ac -
tive to bring about cre ation for the en joy ment of the fruits of ac tions.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 199
```

For these rea sons the doc trine of the at oms be ing the cause of the
world must be re jected.
The Vaiseshikas may ar gue that the mo tion orig i nates in the at -
oms as soon as they come in the prox im ity of the souls charged with
any def i nite Adrishta. This also is un ten a ble. Be cause there can be no
prox im ity or con tact be tween the souls which are partless and the at -
oms which also are partless.
An in sen tient ob ject can not move an other as it is in ert. All mo -
tion of ob jects are ini ti ated, guided and di rected by in tel li gence and in -
tel li gent be ings.
The soul can not be the cause of the pri mal mo tion of the at oms
at the be gin ning of cre ation. Be cause in dis so lu tion, ac cord ing to the
Vaiseshikas, the soul it self lies dor mant with out pos sess ing any in tel -
li gence and hence is in no way su pe rior to the atom.
It can not be said also that the pri mal mo tion of the atom is
caused by the will of the Lord in con for mity with the Adrishta of the
souls, be cause the Adrishtas of the souls do not ma ture and are not
awak ened. Hence the will of the Lord is not ac tive.
As there is thus no mo tion in the at oms in the be gin ning of the
cre ation, they can not come to gether and form an ag gre gate. Con se -
quently, there can be no cre ation as the bi nary com pounds can not be
pro duced.
Ac cord ing to the Vaiseshikas, the uni verse is cre ated by the un -
ion of the at oms. Now what causes this un ion? If it is a seen cause, it
is not pos si ble be fore the cre ation of the body. A seen cause can be
an endeavour or an im pact. There can be no endeavour on the part of
the soul if there is no con nec tion of the soul with mind. As there is nei -
ther body nor mind be fore cre ation, there can not be any endeavour.
Sim i lar is the case with im pact or the like.
What causes the un ion of the at oms? Adrishta or the un seen
prin ci ple can not be the cause of the first mo tion of the at oms be cause
the Adrishta is non-in tel li gent. There is no in tel li gence to guide the
Adrishta. Hence it can not act by it self.
Does the Adrishta in here in the soul or the at oms? If it is in her ent
in the soul, there is no in tel li gence to di rect the Adrishta as the soul is
then in ert. More over, the soul is partless like the at oms. Con se -
quently, there can not be any con nec tion be tween the soul and the at -
oms. Hence, if the Adrishta in heres in the soul, it can not pro duce
mo tion in the at oms which are not con nected with the soul.
If the Adrishta is in her ent in the at oms, there would be no dis so -
lu tion be cause the at oms will ever be ac tive as the Adrishta is al ways
pres ent.
There fore there is no pos si bil ity for orig i nal mo tion in the at oms
and so com bi na tion of at oms is not pos si ble.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 200
```

Hence the the ory of Vaiseshikas that the uni verse is caused by
the com bi na tion of at oms is un ten a ble.

**g_dm`mä`wnJ_mƒ gmå`mXZdpñWVo...Ÿ&**

**Samavayabhyupagamaccha samyadanavasthiteh** II.2.13 (184)
And because in consequence of Samavaya being admitted, a
_regresssus ad infinitum_ results on similar reasoning (hence the
Vaiseshika theory is untenable).

**Samavayabhyupagamat:** Samavaya being admitted; **Cha:** and,
also; **Samyat:** because of equality of reasoning; **Anavasthiteh:**
_regressus ad infinitum_ would result.

The ar gu ment against the Vaiseshika phi los o phy com menced
in Su tra 11 is con tin ued.
Samavaya is in sep a ra ble in her ence or con com i tant cause or
com bin ing force. It is one of the seven cat e go ries of the Vaiseshika
phi los o phy. It is the af fin ity which brings about the un ion of the at oms.
The Vaiseshikas say that two Paramanus be come a Dvyanuka
on ac count of the op er a tion of the com bin ing force (Samavaya) and
that the Samavaya con nects the dyad with its con stit u ents, the two at -
oms, as the dyad and the at oms are of dif fer ent qual i ties. Samavaya
is dif fer ent from the ul ti mate at oms and dyads which it con nects. Why
should it op er ate un less there be an other Samavaya to make it op er -
ate? That new Samavaya will re quire an other Samavaya to con nect it
with the first and so on. Thus their the ory is vi ti ated by the fault of
Anavastha Dosha or _regressus ad in fi ni tum_.
The ar gu ment is faulty. Hence the atomic doc trine which ad mits
Samavaya re la tion ship for the un ion of the at oms is not ad mis si ble. It
must be re jected as it is use less and as it is an in con gru ous as sump -
tion.

**{ZË`_od M ^mdmV²Ÿ&**

**Nityameva cha bhavat** II.2.14 (185)

And on account of the permanent existence (of activity or
non-activity, the atomic theory is not admissible).

**Nityam:** eternal; **Eva:** certainly, even; **Cha:** and, also; **Bhavat:**
because of the existence, from the possibility.

The ar gu ment against the Vaiseshika com menc ing in Su tra 1 1
is con tin ued.
The atomic the ory in volves an other dif fi culty. If the at oms are by
na ture ac tive, then cre ation would be per ma nent. No Pralaya or dis -
so lu tion could take place. If they are by na ture in ac tive, no cre ation
could take place. The dis so lu tion would be per ma nent. Their na ture
can not be both ac tiv ity and in ac tiv ity be cause they are self-con tra dic -
tory. If they were nei ther, their ac tiv ity and non-ac tiv ity would have to

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 201
```

de pend on an op er a tive or ef fi cient cause like Adrishta. As the
Adrishta is in per ma nent prox im ity to the at oms, as the Adrishta is al -
ways con nected with the at oms, they will be ever ac tive. Con se -
quently, cre ation would be per ma nent. If there is no ef fi cient or
op er a tive cause, there will be no ac tiv ity of the at oms. Con se quently,
there would be no cre ation.
For this rea son also the atomic doc trine is un ten a ble and in ad -
mis si ble.

**ê$nm{X_Îdmƒ {dn`©`mo Xe©ZmV²Ÿ&**

**Rupadimatvaccha viparyayo darsanat** II.2.15 (186)
And on account of the atoms possessing colour, etc., the
opposite (of which the Vaiseshikas hold would take place),
because it is seen or observed.

**Rupadimatvat:** because of possessing colour, etc.; **Cha:** and, also;
**Viparyayah:** the reverse, the opposite; **Darsanat:** because it is seen
or observed, from common experience.

The ar gu ment against Vaiseshika com menc ing in Su tra 1 1 is
con tin ued.

Ac cord ing to the Vaiseshika phi los o phy, the at oms are said to
have col our, etc. If this is not th e case, the ef fects will not pos sess
these qual i ties, as the qual i ties of the cause only are found in the ef -
fects. Then the atoms would no lon ger be atomic and per ma nent. Be -

cause that which has form, col our, etc., is gross, ephem eral and
im per ma nent. Con se quently the at oms, etc., which are en dowed with

col our etc., must be gross and impermanent. This con tra dicts the the -
ory of the Vaiseshikas that they are min ute and per ma nent.

Hence the atomic the ory, be ing thus self-con tra dic tory, can not
be ac cepted. The at oms can not be the ul ti mate cause of the uni verse.
There would re sult from the cir cum stance of the at oms hav ing col our,
etc., the op po site of which the Vaiseshikas mean.

**C^`Wm M XmofmV²Ÿ&**

**Ubhaya tha cha doshat** II.2.16 (187)
And because of defects in both cases (the atomic theory cannot
be accepted).

**Ubhayatha:** in both ways, on either side, in either case; **Cha:** also,
and; **Doshat:** because of defects (or difficulties).

The ar gu ment against Vaiseshikas is con tin ued.
Earth has the qual i ties of smell, taste, col our and is gross. Wa ter
has col our, taste and touch and is fine. F ire has col our and touch and
is finer still. Air is the fin est of all and has the qual ity of touch only. The
four gross el e ments earth, wa ter, fire and air are pro duced from at -
oms.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 202
```

If we sup pose that the re spec tive at oms of the el e ments also
pos sess the same num ber of qual i ties as the gross el e ments, then
the atom of air will have one qual ity, an atom of earth will have four
qual i ties. Hence an atom of earth which pos sesses four qual i ties will
be big ger in size. It would not be an atom any lon ger. It will not sat isfy
the def i ni tion of an atom.
If we sup pose them all to pos sess the same num ber of qual i ties,
in that case there can not be any dif fer ence in the qual i ties of the ef -
fects, the gross el e ments be cause the at trib utes of the cause (the at -
oms) are re pro duced in its ef fects (the gross el e ments).
If the atom is one and the same and has only one qual ity, then
more than one qual ity should not be found. Fire should not have form
in ad di tion to touch and so on.
Hence, in ei ther case the doc trine of the Vaiseshikas is de fec -
tive and there fore un ten a ble. It can not be log i cally main tained.

**An[aJ«hmƒmË`ÝV_ZnojmŸ&**

**Aparigrahacchatyantamanapeksha** II.2.17 (188)
And because (the atomic theory) is not accepted (by
authoritative sages like Manu and others) it is to be totally
rejected.

**Aparigrahat:** because it is not accepted; **Cha:** and; **Atyantam:**
altogether, totally, completely; **Anapeksha:** to be rejected.

The ar gu ment against Vaiseshika is con cluded.
At least the Sankhya doc trine of Pradhana was ac cepted to
some ex tent by Manu and other knowers of the Veda but the atomic
doc trine has not been ac cepted by any per son of au thor ity in any of its

parts. There fore, it is to be dis re garded en tirely by all those who take
their stand on the Veda.

Fur ther, there are other ob jec tions to the Vaiseshika doc trine.
The Vaiseshikas as sume six cat e go ries or Padarthas viz., Dravya
(sub stance), Guna (qual ity), Karma (ac tion), Samanya (gen er al ity),
Visesha (par tic u lar ity) and Samavaya (in her ence). They main tain
that the six cat e go ries are ab so lutely dif fer ent from each other and
pos sess dif fer ent char ac ter is tics just as a man, a horse and a hare
dif fer from one an other. They say that the cat e go ries are in de pend ent
and yet they hold that on Dravya the other five cat e go ries de pend.
This con tra dicts the for mer one. This is quite in ap pro pri ate. Just as
an i mals, grass, trees and the like, be ing ab so lutely dif fer ent from
each other, do not de pend on each other, so also the qual i ties etc.,
also be ing ab so lutely dif fer ent from sub stance can not de pend on the
lat ter.
The V aiseshikas say that Dravya (sub stance) and Guna (qual -
ity) are in sep a ra bly con nected. At t he same time th ey say that each

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 203
```

be gins its ac tiv ity. The threads bring the cloth into ex is tence and the
white ness in the threads pro duces the white ness in the cloth. “Sub -
stances orig i nate an other sub stance and qual i ties an other qual ity”
(Vaiseshika Sutras I.1.10). If the thread and its qual ity oc cupy the
same space and are in sep a ra bly united, how can this take place? If
the sub stance and the qual ity are in sep a ra bly to gether with ref er ence
to time, the two horns of a cow would have to grow to gether. If there is
in sep a ra bil ity in the na ture of the sub stance and its qual ity, why can
you not say that both are one and iden ti cal? Hence the the ory that the
qual ity de pends upon sub stance and that the qual ity and sub stance
are in sep a ra ble, is un ten a ble and in ad mis si ble.
Fur ther, the Vaiseshikas make dis tinc tion be tween Samyoga
(con junc tion) and Samavaya (in her ence). They say that Samyoga is
the con nec tion of things which ex ists sep a rately and Samavaya is the
con nec tion of things which are in ca pa ble of sep a rate ex is tence. This
dis tinc tion is not ten a ble as the cause which ex ists be fore the ef fect
can not be said to be in ca pa ble of sep a rate ex is tence. What is the
proof of the ex is tence of Samyoga or Samavaya apart from cause
and ef fect? Nor is there any Samyoga or Samavaya apart from the
things which be come con nected. The same man al though be ing one
only forms the ob ject of many dif fer ent names and no tions ac cord ing
as he is con sid ered in him self or in his re la tion to oth ers. Thus he is
thought and spo ken of as man, Brahmana, learned in the Veda, gen -
er ous boy, young man, old man, fa ther, son, grand son, brother,
son-in-law, etc. The same digit con notes dif fer ent num bers, ten or
hun dred or thou sand, ac cord ing to its place.
More over, we have not seen Samyoga ex cept as be tween
things which oc cupy space. But mind is Anu and does not oc cupy
space ac cord ing to you. You can not say that you will imag ine some
space for it. If you make such a sup po si tion, there is no end to such
sup po si tions. There is no rea son why you should not as sume a fur -
ther hun dred or thou sand things in ad di tion to the six cat e go ries as -
sumed by the Vaiseshikas.
More over, two Paramanus which have no form can not be united
with a Dvyanuka which has form. There does not ex ist that kind of in ti -
mate con nec tion be tween ether and earth which ex ists be tween
wood and var nish.
Nor is the the ory of Samavaya nec es sary to ex plain which, out
of cause and ef fect, de pends on the other. There is mu tual de pend -
ence. Vedantins do not ac cept any dif fer ence be tween cause and ef -
fect. Ef fect is only cause in an other form. The Vedantins ac knowl edge
nei ther the sep a rate ness of cause and ef fect, nor their stand ing to
each other in the re la tion of abode and the thing abid ing. Ac cord ing to
the Vedanta doc trine, the ef fect is only a cer tain state of the cause.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 204
```

More over, Paramanus are fi nite and so they will have form.
What has form must be li a ble to de struc tion.
Thus it is quite clear that the atomic doc trine is sup ported by
very weak ar gu ments. It is op posed to those scrip tural texts which de -
clare the Lord to be the gen eral cause. It is not also ac cepted by
sages like Manu and oth ers. There fore, it should be to tally dis re -
garded by wise men.

**Samudaya ubhayahetuke’pi tadapraptih** II.2.18 (189)
Even if the (two kinds of) aggregates proceed from their two
causes, there would take place non-establishment (of the two
aggregates).

**Samudaya:** the aggregate; **Ubhayahetuke:** having two causes; **Api:**
also, even; **Tadapraptih:** it will not take place, it cannot be
established.

Af ter re fut ing the atomic the ory of Vaiseshika, the Buddhistic
the o ries are now re futed.
Lord Bud dha had four dis ci ples who founded four sys tems of
phi los o phy, called re spec tively Vaibhashika, Sautrantika, Yogachara
and Madhyamika. The Vaibhashikas are the Re al ists
(Sarvastitvavadins) who ac cept the re al ity of both the out side and the
in side world con sist ing re spec tively of ex ter nal ob jects and thought
(also con scious ness, feel ings, etc.). The Sautrantikas are the Ide al -
ists (Vijnanavadins). They hold that thought alone is real. They main -
tain that there is no proof whether ex ter nal ob jects re ally ex ist or not,
the ideas only ex ist and the ex ter nal ob jects are in ferred from these
ideas. Thus the Vaibhashikas hold that the ex ter nal ob jects are di -
rectly per ceived while the Sautrantikas main tain that the out ward
world is an in fer ence from ideas. The third class, the Yogacharas hold
that ideas alone are real and there is no ex ter nal world cor re spond ing
to these ideas. The out ward ob jects are un real like dream ob jects.
The Madhyamikas main tain that even the ideas them selves are
un real and there is noth ing that ex ists ex cept the void (Sunyam).
They are the Ni hil ists or Sunyavadins who hold that ev ery thing is void
and un real. All of them agree that ev ery thing is mo men tary. Noth ing
lasts be yond a mo ment. Things of the pre vi ous mo ment do not ex ist in
the next mo ment. One ap pears and the next mo ment it is re placed by
an other. There is no con nec tion be tween the one and the other. Ev -
ery thing is like a scene in a cin ema which is pro duced by the suc ces -
sive ap pear ance and dis ap pear ance of sev eral iso lated pic tures.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 205
```

The Re al ists re cog nise two ag gre gates, viz., the ex ter nal ma te -
rial world and the in ter nal men tal world, which to gether make up the
uni verse. The ex ter nal world is made up of the ag gre gate of at oms,
which are of four kinds, viz., at oms of earth which are solid, at oms of
wa ter which are vis cid, at oms of fire which are hot and at oms of air
which are mo bile.
The five Skandhas or groups are the cause for the in ter nal
world. They are Rupa Skandha, Vijnana Skandha, Vedana Skandha,
Samjna Skandha and Samskara Skandha. The senses and their ob -
jects form the Rupa Skandha. Vijnana Skandha is the stream of con -
scious ness which gives the no tion of ego ism or ‘I’. The Vedana
Skandha com prises the feel ing of plea sure and pain. The Samjna
Skandha con sists of names such as Ramakrishna, etc. All words thus
con sti tute the Samjna Skandha. The fifth Skandha called Samskara
Skandha con sists of the at trib utes of the mind such as af fec tion, ha -
tred, de lu sion, merit (Dharma), de merit (Adharma), etc. All in ter nal
ob jects be long to any one of the last four Skandhas. The four last
Skandhas form the in ter nal ob jects. All ac tiv i ties de pend upon the in -
ter nal ob jects. The in ter nal ob jects con sti tute the in ner mo tive of ev -
ery thing. All ex ter nal ob jects be long to one Skandha namely the Rupa
Skandha. Thus the whole uni verse con sists of these two kinds of ob -
jects, in ter nal and ex ter nal. The in ter nal ag gre gate or the men tal
world is formed by the ag gre gate of the last four Skandhas. These are
the two in ter nal and ex ter nal ag gre gates re ferred to in the Su tra.
The the ory of the Bauddhas which clas si fies all ob jects un der
two heads, one ag gre gate be ing called the ex ter nal, the other in ter -
nal, is not suf fi cient to ex plain the world or der; be cause all ag gre gates
are un in tel li gent and there is no per ma nent in tel li gence ad mit ted by
the Bauddhas which can bring about this ag gre ga tion. Ev ery thing is
mo men tary in its ex is tence ac cord ing to the Bauddhas. There is no
per ma nent in tel li gent be ing who brings about the con junc tion of these
Skandhas. The con tin u a tion is not pos si ble for these ex ter nal at oms
and in ter nal sen sa tions with out the in ter ven tion of an in tel li gent
guide. If it be said they come to gether of their own in ter nal mo tion,
then the world be comes eter nal; be cause the Skandhas will be con -
stantly bring ing about cre ation as they are eter nal and as they pos -
sess mo tion of their own. Thus this the ory is un ten a ble.
It can not be ex plained how the ag gre gates are brought about,
be cause the parts that con sti tute the ma te rial ag gre gates are des ti -
tute of in tel li gence. The Bauddhas do not ad mit any other per ma nent
in tel li gent be ing such as en joy ing soul or a rul ing lord, which could ef -
fect the ag gre ga tion of at oms.
How are the ag gre gates formed? Is there any in tel li gent prin ci -
ple be hind the ag gre gates as the Cause, the Guide, the Con trol ler or
the Di rec tor? Or does it take place spon ta ne ously? If you say that

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 206
```

there is an in tel li gent prin ci ple, is it per ma nent or mo men tary? If it is
per ma nent, then the Buddhistic doc trine of mo men tari ness is op -
posed. If it is mo men tary, it must come into ex is tence first and then
unite the at oms. Then the cause should last more than one mo ment.
If there is no in tel li gent prin ci ple as di rec tor or con trol ler, how can
non-in tel li gent at oms and the Skandhas ag gre gate in an or derly man -
ner? Fur ther, the cre ation would con tinue for ever. There would be no
dis so lu tion.
For all these rea sons the for ma tion of ag gre gates can not be
prop erly ex plained. With out ag gre gates there would be an end of the
stream of earthly ex is tence which pre sup poses those ag gre gates.
There fore, the doc trine of this school of Bauddhas is un ten a ble and
in ad mis si ble.

**Itaretarapratyayatvaditi
chennotpattimatranimittatvat** II.2.19 (190)

If it be said that (the formation of aggregates may be explained)
through (nescience) standing in the relation of mutual
causality, we say ‘no’; they merely are the efficient cause of the
origin (of the immediately subsequent links and not of the
aggregation).

**Itara-itara:** mutual, one another; **Pratyayatvat:** because of being the
cause, one being the cause of the other; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; ( **Iti chet:** if
it be said); **Na:** no; **Utpattimatranimittatvat:** because they are
merely the efficient cause of the origin.

An ob jec tion against Su tra 18 is raised and re futed.
The se ries be gin ning with ne science com prise the fol low ing
mem bers: Ne science, Samskara or im pres sion, Vijnana (knowl -
edge), name and form, the abode of the six (i.e., the body and the
senses, con tact, ex pe ri ence of plea sure and pain, de sire, ac tiv ity,
merit, de merit, birth, spe cies, de cay, death, grief, lam en ta tion, men tal
af flic tion and the like).
Ne science is the er ror of con sid er ing that what is mo men tary,
im pure, etc., to be per ma nent, pure, etc. Im pres sion, (af fec tion,
Samskara) com prises de sire, aver sion, etc., and the ac tiv ity caused
by them. Knowl edge (Vijnana) is the self-con scious ness ( _Aham iti
alayavijnanasya vrittilabhah_ ) spring ing up in the em bryo. Name and
form is the ru di men tary flake or bub ble-like con di tion of the em bryo.
The abode of the six (Sadayatana) is the fur ther de vel oped stage of
the em bryo in which the lat ter is the abode of the six senses. Touch
(Sparsa) is the sen sa tion of cold, warmth, etc., on the em bryo’s part.
Feel ing (Vedana) is the sen sa tion of plea sure and pain re sult ing
there from. De sire (Trishna) is the wish to en joy the plea sur able sen -
sa tions and to shun the pain ful ones. Ac tiv ity (Upadana) is the ef fort

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 207
```

re sult ing from de sire. Birth is the pass ing out from the uterus. Spe cies
(Jati) is the class of be ings to which the new-born crea ture be longs.
De cay (Jara), death (Marana) is ex plained as the con di tion of the
crea ture when about to die (Mumursha). Grief (Soka) is the frus tra tion
of wishes con nected there with. La ment (Parivedana): the lam en ta -
tions on that ac count. Pain (Duhkha) is such pain as caused by the
five senses. Durmanas is men tal af flic tion. The ‘and the like’ im plies
death, the de par ture to an other world and the sub se quent re turn from
there.
The Buddhistic re al ist says: Al though there ex ists no per ma nent
in tel li gent prin ci ple of the na ture ei ther of a rul ing Lord of an en joy ing
soul un der whose in flu ence the for ma tion of the ag gre gates could
take place, yet the course of earthly ex is tence is ren dered pos si ble
through the mu tual cau sal ity of ne science (ig no rance) and so on, so
that we need not look for any other com bin ing prin ci ple.
Ne science, Samskara, etc., con sti tute an un in ter rupted chain of
cause and ef fect. In the above se ries the im me di ately pre ced ing item
is the cause of the next. The wheel of cause and ef fect re volves un -
ceas ingly like the wa ter-wheel and this can not take place with out ag -
gre gates. Hence ag gre gates are a re al ity.
We re ply: Though in the se ries the pre ced ing one is the cause of
the sub se quent one, there is noth ing which can be the cause of the
ag gre gates. It may be ar gued that the un ion of atom and the con tin u -
ous flow of sen sa tions are proved by the mu tual in ter de pen dence ex -
ist ing among them. But the ar gu ment can not stand, as this mu tual
in ter de pen dence can not be the cause of their co he sion. Of two things
one may pro duce the other, but that is no rea son why they should
unite to gether.
Even if Avidya (ne science), Samskara, Vijnana, Nama, and
Rupa, etc., may with out a sen tient or in tel li gent agency pass from the
stage of cause to the stage of ef fect, yet how can the to tal ity of all
these si mul ta neously ex ist with out the will of a co or di nat ing mind?
If you say that this ag gre gate or the world is formed by the mu -
tual cau sa tion of Avidya and the rest, we say it is not so, be cause your
link of cau sa tion ex plains only the or i gin of the sub se quent from the
pre vi ous. It only ex plains how Vijnana arises from Samskara, etc. It
does not ex plain how the ag gre gate is brought about. An ag gre gate
called Sanghata al ways shows a de sign and is brought about for the
pur pose of en joy ment. A Sanghata like a house may be ex plained to
have been pro duced by putt ing to gether of bricks, mor tar, etc., but
they do not ex plain the de sign. You say that there is no per ma nent At -
man. Your At man is mo men tary only. You are a Kshanikatvavadin.
There can be no en joy ment or ex pe ri enc ing for such a mo men tary
soul; be cause the en joy ing soul has not pro duced the merit or de merit
whose fruits it has to en joy. It was pro duced by an other mo men tary

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 208
```

soul. You can not say that the mo men tary soul suf fers the fruits of the
acts done by its an ces tral soul, for then that an ces tral soul must be
held to be per ma nent and not mo men tary. If you hold any soul to be
per ma nent, it will con tra dict your the ory of the mo men tari ness of ev -
ery thing. But if you hold ev ery thing to be im per ma nent, your the ory is
open to the ob jec tion al ready made. Hence the doc trine of the
Sanghatas (Bud dhists) is un ten a ble. It is not based on rea son.
The at oms can not com bine by them selves even when they are
as sumed to be per ma nent and eter nal. We have al ready shown this
when ex am in ing the doc trine of the Vaiseshikas. Their com bi na tion is
much more im pos si ble when they are mo men tary.
The Bauddhas say that a com bin ing prin ci ple of the at oms is not
nec es sary if the at oms stand in a re la tion of cau sal ity. The at oms
would com bine by them selves. This is in cor rect. The cau sal ity will ex -
plain only the pro duc tion of at oms at dif fer ent mo ments. It can not cer -
tainly ex plain the un ion of the atom into an ag gre gate. The
com bi na tion of an ag gre gate can take place only if there is an in tel li -
gent agent be hind. Oth er wise it is im pos si ble to ex plain the un ion of
in ert and mo men tary at oms.
You will say that in the eter nal Samsara the ag gre gates suc ceed
one an other in an un bro ken chain and hence also Ne science and so
on which abide in those ag gre gates. But in that case you will have to
as sume ei ther that each ag gre gate nec es sar ily pro duces an other ag -
gre gate of the same kind, or that it may pro duce ei ther a like or an un -
like one with out any set tled or def i nite rule. In the for mer case a
hu man body could never pass over into that of a god or an an i mal or a
be ing of the in fer nal re gions as like will go on pro duc ing like; in the lat -
ter case a man might in an in stant be come an el e phant or a god and
again be come a man; ei ther of which con se quences would be con -
trary to your sys tem.
The in di vid ual soul for whose en joy ment this ag gre gate of body
etc., ex ists is also ev a nes cent or mo men tary. It can not there fore be
an enjoyer. As the in di vid ual soul is mo men tary, whose is lib er a tion?
As there is no per ma nent enjoyer, there is no ne ces sity for these ag -
gre gates. There may ex ist a causal re la tion be tween the mem bers of
the se ries con sist ing of Ne science, etc., but in the ab sence of a per -
ma nent en joy ing soul, it is not pos si ble to es tab lish on that ground the
ex is tence of ag gre gates. Hence the doc trine of mo men tari ness of the
Bud dhist school of Re al ists can not stand.

**CÎmamoËnmXo M nyd©{ZamoYmV²Ÿ&**

**Uttarotpade cha purvanirodhat** II.2.20 (191)

(Nor can there be a causal relation between nescience, etc.)
because on the origination of the subsequent thing the
preceding one ceases to be.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 209
```

**Uttarotpade:** at the time of the production of the subsequent thing;
**Cha:** and; **Purvanirodhat:** because the antecedent one has ceased
to exist, because of the destruction of the previous thing. ( **Uttara:** in
the next, in the subsequent; **Utpade:** on the origination, on the
production.)

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory, com menced in Su -
tra 18, is con tin ued.
We have hith erto ar gued that ne science and so on stand in a
causal re la tion to each other merely, so that they can not be made to
ac count for the ex is tence of the ag gre gates. We are now go ing to
prove that they can not even be re garded as ef fi cient causes of the
sub se quent mem bers of the se ries to which they be long.
Ac cord ing to the Buddhistic the ory ev ery thing is mo men tary. A
thing of the pres ent mo ment van ishes in the next mo ment when its
suc ces sor man i fests. At the time of the ap pear ance of a sub se quent
thing, the pre vi ous thing van ishes. Hence it is im pos si ble for the pre vi -
ous thing to be the cause of the sub se quent thing. Con se quently the
the ory is un ten a ble and in ad mis si ble. It can not stand to rea son.
We al ways per ceive that the cause sub sists in the ef fect as the
thread sub sists in the cloth. But the Bud dhists hold that ex is tence
orig i nates from non-ex is tence be cause they main tain that the ef fect
can not man i fest with out the de struc tion of the cause, the tree can not
ap pear un til the seed is de stroyed.
Even the pass ing of cause into ef fect in a se ries of suc ces sive
states like ne science, etc., can not take place, un less there is a co or di -
nat ing in tel li gence. You say that ev ery thing has only a mo men tary ex -
is tence. Your School can not bring about the si mul ta neous ex is tence
of two suc ces sive mo ments. If the cause ex ists till it passes into the
stage of ef fect, the the ory of mo men tary ex is tence (Kshanikatva) will
van ish.
You may say that the for mer mo men tary ex is tence when it has
reached its full de vel op ment be comes the cause of the later mo men -
tary ex is tence. That also is im pos si ble, be cause even that will re quire
a suc ces sive or sec ond mo ment for op er a tion. This con tra dicts the
doc trine of mo men tari ness.
The the ory of mo men tary ex is tence (Kshanikatva) can not
stand. The gold that ex ists at the time the or na ment is made is alone
the cause of the or na ment and not that which ex isted be fore and has
ceased to ex ist then. If it be still held to be the cause, then ex is tence
will come out of non-ex is tence. This is not pos si ble. The the ory of mo -
men tari ness will con tra dict the doc trine that the ef fect is the cause in a
new form. This doc trine in di cates that the cause ex ists in the ef fect.
This shows that it is not mo men tary. Fur ther, orig i na tion and de struc -
tion will be the same ow ing to mo men tari ness. If it is said that there is
dif fer ence be tween orig i na tion and de struc tion, then we will have to

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 210
```

say that the thing lasts for more than one mo ment. Hence we have
again to de clare the doc trine of mo men tari ness to be un ten a ble.

**Ag{V à{VkmonamoYmo `m¡JnÚ_Ý`WmŸ&**

**Asati pratijnoparodho yaugapadyamanyatha** II.2.21 (192)

If non-existence (of cause) be assumed, (while yet the effect
takes place), there results contradiction of the admitted
principle or proposition. Otherwise there would result
simultaneity (of cause and effect).

**Asati:** in the case of non-existence of cause, if it be admitted that an
effect is produced without a cause; **Pratijna:** proposition, admitted
principle; **Uparodhah:** contradiction, denial; **Yaugapadyam:**
simultaneity, simultaneous existence; **Anyatha:** otherwise.

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued.
If the Bud dhists say that an ef fect is pro duced with out a cause
then they would con tra dict their own prop o si tion that ev ery ef fect has
a cause. The prop o si tion ad mit ted by Bud dhists that the con scious -
ness of blue, etc., arises when mind, eye, light and ob ject act in un ion
as cause will fail. All sorts of ef fects can co-ex ist.
If a cause be as sumed then we have to ac cept that the cause
and ef fect ex ist si mul ta neously at the next mo ment. The cause ex ists
for more than one mo ment. The cause ex ists till the state of ef fect is
reached. Then the doc trine of mo men tari ness will fail.

**Pratisankhyapratisankhyanirodha
praptiravicchedat** II.2.22 (193)

Conscious and unconscious destruction would be impossible
on account of non-interruption.

**Pratisankhya nirodha:** conscious destruction, destruction due to
some cause or agency; causal destruction, destruction depending
upon the volition of conscious entity; **Apratisankhya nirodha:**
unconscious destruction, destruction not depending upon any
voluntary agency; **Apraptih:** non-attainment, impossibility;
**Avicchedat:** because of non-interruption, because it goes on without
interruption.

The ar gu ment against the the ory of the Bud dhists is con tin ued.
The Bud dhists hold that uni ver sal de struc tion is ever go ing on
and that this de struc tion or ces sa tion is of two kinds, viz., con scious
and un con scious. Con scious de struc tion de pends upon an act of
thought as when a man breaks a jar hav ing pre vi ously formed the in -
ten tion of do ing so. Un con scious de struc tion is the nat u ral de cay of
ob jects.
The flow of cause and ef fect goes on with out in ter rup tion and
there fore can not be sub ject to ei ther kind of de struc tion. Nor can any

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 211
```

in di vid ual an te ced ent of a se ries be said to be to tally de stroyed, as it
is re cog nised in its im me di ate con se quence.
Both kinds of de struc tion or ces sa tion are im pos si ble be cause it
must re fer ei ther to the se ries of mo men tary existences or to the sin -
gle mem bers con sti tut ing the se ries.
The for mer al ter na tive is not pos si ble be cause in all se ries of
mo men tary existences the mem bers of the se ries stand in an un bro -
ken re la tion of cause and ef fect so that the se ries can not be in ter -
rupted. The lat ter al ter na tive is sim i larly not ad mis si ble, be cause it is
not pos si ble to hold that any mo men tary ex is tence should un dergo
com plete an ni hi la tion en tirely un de fin able and dis con nected with the
pre vi ous state of ex is tence, as we ob serve that a thing is re cog nised
in the var i ous states through which it may pass and thus has a con -
nected ex is tence. When an earthen jar is de stroyed we find the ex is -
tence of the clay in the pot sherds or frag ments into which the jar is
bro ken or in the pow der into which the pot sherds are ground. We in fer
that even though what seems to van ish al to gether such as a drop of
wa ter which has fallen on heated iron, yet con tin ues to ex ist in some
other form, viz., as steam.
The se ries of mo men tary ex is tence form ing a chain of causes
and ef fect is con tin u ous and can never be stopped, be cause the last
mo men tary ex is tence be fore its an ni hi la tion must be sup posed ei ther
to pro duce its ef fect or not to pro duce it. If it does, then the se ries is
con tin ued and will not be de stroyed. If it does not pro duce the ef fect,
the last link does not re ally ex ist as the Bauddhas de fine Satta of a
thing as its causal ef fi ciency and the non-ex is tence of the last link
would lead back ward to the non-ex is tence of the whole se ries.
We can not have then two kinds of de struc tion in the in di vid ual
mem bers of the se ries also. Con scious de struc tion is not pos si ble on
ac count of the mo men tary ex is tence of each mem ber. There can not
be un con scious de struc tion as the in di vid ual mem ber is not to tally an -
ni hi lated. De struc tion of a thing re ally means only change of con di tion
of the sub stance.
You can not say that when a can dle is burnt out, it is to tally an ni -
hi lated. When a can dle burns out, it is not lost but un der goes a
change of con di tion. We do not cer tainly per ceive the can dle when it
is burnt out, but the ma te ri als of which it con sisted con tinue to ex ist in
a very sub tle state and hence they are im per cep ti ble.
For these rea sons the two kinds of de struc tion which the
Bauddhas as sume can not be proved.

And on account of the objections presenting themselves in

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 212

**Ubhayatha:** in either case; **Cha:** and, also; **Doshat:** because of

objections.

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued.
There is a fal lacy in ei ther view, i.e., that Avidya or ig no rance is
de stroyed by right knowl edge or self-de stroyed.
Ac cord ing to the Buddhistic view, eman ci pa tion is the an ni hi la -
tion of ig no rance. Sal va tion or free dom is at tained when ig no rance is
de stroyed. Ig no rance (Avidya or ne science) is the false idea of per -
ma nency in things which are mo men tary.
The ig no rance can be an ni hi lated by the adop tion of some
means such as pen ance, knowl edge, etc., (con scious de struc tion); or
it may de stroy it self (spon ta ne ity). But both the al ter na tives are de fec -
tive. Be cause this an ni hi la tion of ig no rance can not be at tained by the
adop tion of pen ance or the like; for the mean like ev ery other thing, is
also mo men tary ac cord ing to the Buddhistic view and is, there fore,
not likely to pro duce such an ni hi la tion; an ni hi la tion can not take place
of its own ac cord, for in that case all Buddhistic in struc tions, the dis ci -
plines and meth ods of med i ta tion for the at tain ment of eman ci pa tion
will be use less.
Ac cord ing to the Buddhistic the ory, there can be no vol un tary
ex er tion on the part of the as pi rant for the break ing asun der of his
con tin ued worldly ex pe ri ences or ne science. There is no hope of their
ever com ing to an end by mere ex haus tion as the causes con tinue to
gen er ate their ef fects which again con tinue to gen er ate their own ef -
fects and so on and there is no oc ca sion left for prac tices for at tain ing
re lease.
Thus in the Buddhistic sys tem re lease or free dom can never be
es tab lished. The teach ing of the Bud dhists can not stand the test of
rea son ing.

**Aakase chaviseshat** II.2.24 (195)

The cause of Akasa (ether) also not being different (from the
two other kinds of destruction it also cannot be a non-entity.)

**Akase:** in the case of Akasa or ether; **Cha:** also, and; **Aviseshat:**

because of no specific difference.

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued.
We have shown in Sutras 22-23 that the two kinds of de struc tion
(ces sa tion) are not to tally des ti tute of all pos i tive char ac ter is tics and
so can not be non-en ti ties. We now pro ceed to show the same with re -
gard to space (ether, Akasa).
The Bud dhists do not re cog nise the ex is tence of Akasa. They
re gard Akasa as a non-en tity. Akasa is noth ing but the ab sence of
cov er ing or oc cu py ing body (Avaranabhava). This is un-rea son able.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 213
```

Akasa has the qual ity of sound, just as earth has smell, wa ter taste,
fire form, air touch. Akasa also is a dis tinct en tity like earth, wa ter, etc.
Hence there is no rea son why Akasa also should be re jected as a
non-en tity, while earth, wa ter, etc., are re cog nised as be ing en ti ties.
Just as earth, air, etc., are re garded as en ti ties on ac count of
their be ing the sub stra tum of at trib utes like smell, etc., so also Akasa
should be con sid ered as an en tity on ac count of its be ing the sub stra -
tum of sound. Earth, wa ter, etc., are ex pe ri enced through their re -
spec tive qual i ties, viz., smell, taste, form, touch. The ex is tence of
Akasa is ex pe ri enced through its qual ity, sound. Hence Akasa also
must be an en tity.
Space is in ferred from its at trib ute of sound, just as earth is in -
ferred from smell. Where there is re la tion of sub stance and at trib ute
there must be an ob ject. The Bud dhists hold that space is mere
non-ex is tence of mat ter (Avaranabhavamatram). If so, a bird may fall
down as there is no ob struc tive mat ter, but how can it fly up? Non-ex -
is tence of mat ter is space which is a pos i tive ob ject and not mere ne -
ga tion or non-en tity.
The doc trine that Akasa is an ab so lute non-en tity is not ten a ble.
Why do you say so? Aviseshat, be cause there is no dif fer ence in the
case of Akasa from any other kind of sub stance which is an ob ject of
per cep tion. We per ceive space when we say, “the crow flies in
space.” The space, there fore, is as much a real sub stance as the
earth, etc. As we know the earth by its qual ity of smell, wa ter by its
qual ity of taste, and so on, so we know from the qual ity of be ing the
abode of ob jects, the ex is tence of space, and that it has the qual ity of
sound. Thus Akasa is a real sub stance and not a non-en tity.
If Akasa be a non-en tity, then the en tire world would be come
des ti tute of space.
Scrip tural pas sages de clare “Space sprang from the At man”
( _Atmana akasassambhutah_ ). So Akasa is a real thing. It is a Vastu
(ex ist ing ob ject) and not non-ex is tence.
O Bud dhists! You say that air ex ists in Akasa. In the Bauddha
scrip tures, a se ries of ques tions and an swers be gin ning “On which, O
re vered Sir, is the earth founded?” in which the fol low ing ques tion oc -
curs, “On which is the air founded?” to which it is re plied that the air is
founded on space (ether). Now it is clear that this state ment is ap pro -
pri ate only on the sup po si tion of space be ing a pos i tive en tity, not a
mere ne ga tion. If Akasa was to tally non-ex is tent, what would be the
re cep ta cle of air?
You can not say that space is noth ing but the ab sence of any oc -
cu py ing ob ject. This also can not stand to rea son. If you say that
space is noth ing but the ab sence in gen eral of any cov er ing or oc cu -
py ing body, then when one bird is fly ing, whereby space is oc cu pied,
there would be no room for a sec ond bird which wishes to fly at the

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 214
```

same time. You may give an an swer that the sec ond bird may fly there
where there is ab sence of a cov er ing body. But we de clare that that
some thing by which the ab sence of cov er ing bod ies is dis tin guished
must be a pos i tive en tity, viz., space in our sense and not the mere
non-ex ist ing of cov er ing bod ies.
More over, there is a self-con tra dic tion in the state ments of Bud -
dhists with ref er ence to the three kinds of neg a tive en ti ties
(Nirupakhya). They say that the neg a tive en ti ties are not pos i tively
de fin able, and also are eter nal. It is ab surd to talk of a non-be ing as
be ing eter nal or ev a nes cent. The dis tinc tion of sub jects and pred i -
cates of at tri bu tion to tally rests on real things. Where there is such
dis tinc tion, there ex ists the real thing such as pot, etc., which is not a
mere un de fin able ne ga tion or non-en tity.

**AZwñ_¥VoüŸ&**

**Anusmritescha** II.2.25 (196)

And on account of memory the things are not momentary.

**Anusmriteh:** on account of memory; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued.
The the ory of mo men tari ness of the Bud dhists is re futed here. If
ev ery thing is mo men tary the experiencer of some thing must also be
mo men tary. But the experiencer is not mo men tary, be cause peo ple
have the mem ory of past ex pe ri ences. Mem ory can take place only in
a man who has pre vi ously ex pe ri enced it, be cause we ob serve that
what one man has ex pe ri enced is not re mem bered by an other man. It
is not that the ex pe ri ence is that one sees and an other re mem bers.
Our ex pe ri ence is “I saw and I now re mem ber what I saw.” He who ex -
pe ri ences and re mem bers is the same. He is con nected with at least
two mo ments. This cer tainly re futes the the ory of mo men tari ness.
The Bud dhists may say that mem ory is due to sim i lar ity. But un -
less there be one per ma nent know ing sub ject, who can per ceive the
sim i lar ity in the past with the pres ent. One can not say “This is the pot,
this is the chair which was in the past.” So long there is not the same
soul which saw and which now re mem bers, how can mere sim i lar ity
bring about such a con scious ness as “I saw and I now re mem ber
(Pratyabhijna)?” The know ing sub ject must be per ma nent and not
mo men tary.
Doubt may arise with ref er ence to an ex ter nal ob ject. You may
not be able to say whether it is iden ti cally the same ob ject which was
per ceived in the past or some thing sim i lar to it. But with ref er ence to
the Self, the cog nis ing sub ject, there can never arise any such doubt
whether I am the same who was in the past, for it is im pos si ble that
the mem ory of a thing per ceived by an other should ex ist in one’s own
Self.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 215
```

If you say that this, the thing re mem bered, is like that, the thing
seen, in that case also two things are con nected by one agent. If the
thing per ceived was sep a rate and ceased to tally, it can not be re ferred
at all. More over the ex pe ri ence is not that “this is like that” but that
“this is that.”
We ad mit that some times with ref er ence to an ex ter nal thing a
doubt may arise whether it is that or merely is sim i lar to that; be cause
mis take may oc cur con cern ing what lies out side our minds. But the
con scious sub ject never has any doubt whether it is it self or only sim i -
lar to it self. It is dis tinctly con scious that it is one and the same sub ject
which yes ter day had a cer tain sen sa tion and re mem bers that sen sa -
tion to day. Does any one doubt whether he who re mem bers is the
same as he who saw?
For this rea son also the the ory of mo men tari ness of the Bud -
dhists is to be re jected.
We do not per ceive ob jects com ing into ex is tence in a mo ment
or van ish ing in a mo ment. Thus the the ory of mo men tari ness of all
things is re futed.

**ZmgVmo@Ñï>ËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Nasato’drishtatvat** II.2.26 (l97)

(Existence or entity does) not (spring) from non-existence or
non-entity, because it is not seen.

**Na:** not; **Asatah:** from non-existence, of the unreal, of a non-entity;
**Adrishtatvat:** because it is not seen.

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued.
A non-en tity has not been ob served to pro duce en tity. There fore
it does not stand to rea son to sup pose non-en tity to be the cause.
The Bauddhas (Vainasikas) as sert that no ef fect can be pro -
duced from any thing that is un chang ing and eter nal, be cause an un -
chang ing thing can not pro duce an ef fect. So they de clare that the
cause per ishes be fore the ef fect is pro duced. They say from the de -
com posed seed only the young plant springs, spoilt milk only turns
into curds, and the lump of clay has ceased to be a lump when it be -
comes a pot. So ex is tence co mes out of non-ex is tence.
Ac cord ing to the view of the Bud dhists, a real thing, i.e., the
world has come into ex is tence out of noth ing. But ex pe ri ence shows
that this the ory is false. A pot for in stance is never found to be pro -
duced with out clay. Such a hy po thet i cal pro duc tion can only ex ist in
the imag i na tion, for ex am ple, the child of a bar ren woman. Hence the
view of the Bud dhists is un ten a ble and in ad mis si ble.
If ex is tence can come out of non-ex is tence, if be ing can pro -
ceed from non-be ing, then the as sump tion of spe cial causes would
have no mean ing at all. Then any thing may come out of any thing, be -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 216
```

cause non-en tity is one and the same in all cases. There is no dif fer -

ence be tween the non-en tity of a mango seed and that of a jack-seed.

Hence a jack tree may come out of a mango seed. Sprouts also may

orig i nate from the horns of hares. If there are dif fer ent kinds of

non-ex is tence, hav ing spe cial dis tinc tions just as for in stance, blue -

ness and the like are the spe cial qual i ties of lo tuses and so on, the

non-ex is tence of a mango seed will dif fer from that of a jack-seed,

and then this would turn non-en ti ties into en ti ties.
More over if ex is tence springs from non-ex is tence all ef fects

would be af fected with non-ex is tence, but they are seen to be pos i tive

en ti ties with their var i ous spe cial char ac ter is tics.
The horn of a hare is non-ex is tent. What can come out from that

horn? We see only be ing emerg ing from be ing, e.g., or na ment from

gold, etc.
Ac cord ing to the Bauddhas, all mind and all men tal mod i fi ca -

tions spring from the four Skandhas and all ma te rial ag gre gates from

the at oms. And yet they say at the same time that en tity is born of

non-en tity. This is cer tainly quite in con sis tent and self-con tra dic tory.

They stul tify their own doc trine and need lessly con fuse the minds of

ev ery one.

And thus (if existence should spring from non-existence, there

of the goal.

```
The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued.
If it were ad mit ted that ex is tence or en tity springs from non-ex is -
```
tence or non-en tity, lazy in ac tive peo ple also would at tain their pur -

pose. Rice will grow even if the farmer does not cul ti vate his field. Jars

will shape them selves even if the pot ter does not fash ion the clay. The

weaver too will have fin ished pieces of cloth with out weav ing. No body

will have to ex ert him self in the least ei ther for go ing to the heav enly

world or for at tain ing fi nal eman ci pa tion. All this is ab surd and not

main tained by any body.
Thus the doc trine of the orig i na tion of ex is tence or en tity from

non-ex is tence or non-en tity is un ten a ble or in ad mis si ble.

The non-existence (of eternal things) cannot be maintained; on

account of (our) consciousness (of them).

**Na:** not; **Abhavah:** non-existence; **Upalabdheh:** because they are

perceived, because of perception, because we are conscious of them

on account of their being experienced.

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued. From
this Su tra be gins the ref u ta tion of Buddhistic Ide al ists.
The doc trine of the Bud dhist which af firms the mo men tary ex is -
tence of ex ter nal ob jects has been re futed. The Sutrakara or the au -
thor of the Sutras now pro ceeds to re fute the doc trine of the
Buddhistic school which af firms the mo men tari ness of thought, which
de clares that only ideas ex ist and noth ing else.
Ac cord ing to the Buddhistic Ide al ists (Vijnanavadins), the ex ter -
nal world is non-ex is tent. They main tain that ev ery phe nom e non re -
solves it self into con scious ness and idea with out any re al ity
cor re spond ing to it. This is not cor rect. The ex ter nal phe nom ena are
not non-ex is tent as they are ac tu ally wit nessed by our senses of per -
cep tion. The ex ter nal world is an ob ject of ex pe ri ence through the
senses. It can not there fore, be non-ex is tent like the horns of a hare.
The Vijnanavadins say: No ex ter nal ob ject ex ists apart from
con scious ness. There is im pos si bil ity for the ex is tence of out ward
things. Be cause if out ward ob jects are ad mit ted, they must be ei ther
at oms or ag gre gates of at oms such as chairs, pots, etc. But at oms
can not be com pre hended un der the ideas of chair, etc. It is not pos si -
ble for cog ni tion to rep re sent things as min ute as at oms. There is no
rec og ni tion of at oms and so the ob jects could not be at oms. They
could not be atomic com bi na tions be cause we can not af firm if such
com bi na tions are one with at oms or sep a rate there from.
Ac cord ing to the Vijnanavadins or the Yogachara sys tem the
Vijnana Skandha or idea alone is real. An ob ject like pot or chair
which is per ceived out side is noth ing more than ideas. The Vijnana or
idea mod i fies it self into the form of an ob ject. All worldly ac tiv i ties can
go on with mere ideas, just as in dream all ac tiv i ties are per formed
with the thought ob jects. Ideas only ex ist. It is use less to as sume that
the ob ject is some thing dif fer ent from the idea. It is pos si ble to have
prac ti cal thought and in ter course with out ex ter nal ob jects, just as it is
done in dream. All prac ti cal pur poses are well ren dered pos si ble by
ad mit ting the re al ity of ideas only, be cause no good pur pose is served

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 218
```

by ad di tional as sump tion of ex ter nal ob jects cor re spond ing to in ter nal
ideas.
The mind as sumes dif fer ent shapes ow ing to the dif fer ent
Vasanas or de sire-im pres sions sub merged in it. Just as these
Vasanas cre ate the dream world, so the ex ter nal world in the wak ing
state is also the re sult of Vasanas. The as sump tion of an ex ter nal ob -
ject is un nec es sary. We do not see any sep a ra tion of cog ni tion and
ob ject. In dream we cog nise with out ob jects. Even so in the wak ing
state there could be cog ni tion with out ob jects. Our manifoldness of
Vasanas can ac count for such cognitions.
Per cep tion in the wak ing state is like a dream. The ideas that
are pres ent dur ing a dream ap pear in the form of sub ject and ob ject,
al though there is no ex ter nal ob ject. Hence, the ideas of chair, pot,
which oc cur in our wak ing state are like wise in de pend ent of ex ter nal
ob jects, be cause they also im ply ideas.
This ar gu ment is fal la cious. When you see a chair or a pot how
can you deny it? When you eat, your hun ger is ap peased. How can
you doubt the hun ger or the food? You say that there is no ob ject
apart from your cog ni tion on ac count of your ca pri cious ness. Why do
you not see a chair as a pot? If an ob ject is a mere men tal cre ation like
a dream why should the mind lo cate it out side?
The Bud dhist may say “I do not af firm that I have no con scious -
ness of an ob ject. I also feel that the ob ject ap pears as an ex ter nal
thing, but what I af firm is this that I am al ways con scious of noth ing di -
rectly save my own ideas. My idea alone shines as some thing ex ter -
nal. Con se quently the ap pear ance of the ex ter nal things is the re sult
of my own ideas.”
We re ply that the very fact of your con scious ness proves that
there is an ex ter nal ob ject giv ing rise to the idea of externality. That
the ex ter nal ob ject ex ists apart from con scious ness has nec es sar ily
to be ac cepted on the ground of the na ture of con scious ness it self. No
one when per ceiv ing a chair or a pot is con scious of his per cep tion
only, but all are con scious of chair or a pot and the like as ob jects of
per cep tion.
You (Vijnanavadins) say that the in ter nal con scious ness or idea
ap pears as some thing ex ter nal. This al ready in di cates that the ex ter -
nal world is real. If it were not real, your say ing like some thing ex ter nal
would be mean ing less. The word ‘like’ shows that you ad mit the re al -
ity of the ex ter nal ob jects. Oth er wise you would not have used this
word. Be cause no one makes a com par i son with a thing which is an
ab so lute un re al ity. No one says that Ramakrishna is like the son of a
bar ren woman.
An idea like a lamp re quires an ul te rior in tel lec tual prin ci ple or
illuminer to ren der it man i fest. Vijnana has a be gin ning and an end. It

also be longs to the cat e gory of the known. The knower is as in dis -
pens able of cognitions as of ob jects.

The Bud dhist ide al ist, while con tend ing that there is noth ing out -
side the mind, for gets the fal lacy of the ar gu ment. If the world, as they
ar gue, were only an out ward ex pres sion of in ter nal ideas, then the
world also would be just mind. But the Bud dhists ar gue that the mind,
which is os ten si bly in the in di vid ual, is also the world out side. Here
the ques tion arises: How does the idea of there be ing noth ing out side
arise with out the mind it self be ing out side? The con scious ness that
noth ing ex ists out side can not arise if there is re ally noth ing out side.
Hence the Bud dhist Vijnanavada doc trine is de fec tive.

When the Bud dhists came to know of the il log i cal ity of their con -
cept, they mod i fied their doc trine say ing that the mind re ferred to here
is not the in di vid ual mind but the cos mic mind, known as
Alaya-Vijnana, which is the re pos i tory of all in di vid ual minds in a po -
ten tial form. Here the Bud dhist stum bles on the Vedanta doc trine that
the world is a man i fes ta tion of the Uni ver sal Mind.

**Vaidharmyat:** on account of difference of nature, because of
dissimilarity; **Cha:** and, also; **Na:** not; **Svapnadivat:** like dreams etc.

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued.
The wak ing state is not like dream, etc., be cause of dis sim i lar ity.
The ideas of the wak ing state are not like those of a dream on ac count
of their dif fer ence of na ture.

The Bud dhists say: The per cep tion of the ex ter nal world is like
the dream. There are no ex ter nal ob jects in a dream and yet the ideas
man i fest as sub ject and ob ject. Even so the ap pear ance of the ex ter -
nal uni verse is in de pend ent of any ob jec tive re al ity.
The anal ogy of dream phe nom ena to the phe nom ena of the
wak ing world is wrong. The con scious ness in a dream and that in a
wake ful state are dis sim i lar. The con scious ness in a dream de pends
on the pre vi ous con scious ness in the wake ful state, but the con -
scious ness in the wake ful state does not de pend on any thing else,
but on the ac tual per cep tion by senses. Fur ther the dream ex pe ri ence
be come false as soon as one wakes up. The dream ing man says as
soon as he wakes up, “I wrongly dreamt that I had a meet ing with the
col lec tor. No such meet ing took place. My mind was dulled by sleep
and so the false ideas arose.” Those things on the con trary, of which

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 220

we are con scious in our wak ing state such as post and the like, are
never ne gated in any state. They stand un chal lenged and un con tra -
dicted. Even af ter hun dreds of years they will have the same ap pear -
ance as now.

More over dream phe nom ena are mere mem o ries whereas the
phe nom ena of the wak ing state are ex pe ri enced as re al i ties. The dis -
tinc tion be tween re mem brance and ex pe ri ence or im me di ate con -
scious ness is di rectly real ised by ev ery one as be ing founded on the
ab sence or pres ence of the ob ject. When a man re mem bers his ab -
sent son, he does not di rectly meet him. Sim ply be cause there is sim i -
lar ity be tween dream state and wak ing state we can not say that they
have the same na ture. If a char ac ter is tic is not the na ture of an ob ject
it will not be come its in her ent na ture sim ply by be ing sim i lar to an ob -
ject which has that na ture. You can not say that fire which burns is cold
be cause it has char ac ter is tics in com mon with wa ter.
Hence the dream ing state and the wak ing state are to tally dis -
sim i lar in their in her ent na ture.

there can be no per cep tion of an ex ter nal thing which is it self non-ex -

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con tin ued.
The men tal im pres sions can not ex ist with out a re cep ta cle or
abode. Even the Alayavijnana or ego-con scious ness can not be the
abode of men tal im pres sions as it is also mo men tary ac cord ing to the
Buddhistic view.
Un less there ex ists one con tin u ous per ma nent prin ci ple equally

un change able Self which cog nises ev ery thing, we are un able to ac -
count for re mem brance, rec og ni tion, which are sub ject to men tal im -
pres sions de pend ent on place, time and cause. If you say that
Alayavijnana is some thing per ma nent then that would con tra dict your
doc trine of mo men tari ness.
We have thus re futed the doc trine of the Bud dhists which holds
the mo men tary re al ity of the ex ter nal world and the doc trine which de -
clares that ideas only ex ist.

And (as the Bauddha system is) illogical in every way (it cannot

be accepted).

**Sarvatha:** in every way; **Anupapatteh:** because of its not being
proved illogical; **Cha:** and, also.

The ar gu ment against the Buddhistic the ory is con cluded here.
The Sunyavada or Ni hil ism of the Bud dhist which as serts that
noth ing ex ists is fal la cious be cause it goes against ev ery method of
proof, viz., per cep tion, in fer ence, tes ti mony and anal ogy. It goes
against the Sruti and ev ery means of right knowl edge. Hence it has to
be to tally ig nored by those who care for their own hap pi ness and wel -
fare. It need not be dis cussed in de tail as it gives way on all sides, like
the walls of a well dug in sandy soil. It has no foun da tion what ever to
rest upon. Any endeavour to use this sys tem as a guide in the prac ti -
cal con cerns of life is mere folly.
O Sunyavadins! You must ad mit your self to be a be ing and your
rea son ing also to be some thing and not noth ing. This con tra dicts your
the ory that all is noth ing.
Fur ther, the means of knowl edge by which Sunyata is to be
proved must at least be real and must be ac knowl edged to be true,

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 222
```

be cause if such means of knowl edge and ar gu ments be them selves
noth ing, then the the ory of noth ing ness can not be es tab lished. If
these means and ar gu ments be true, then some thing cer tainly is
proved. Then also the the ory of noth ing ness is dis proved.

Ekasminnasambhavadhikaranam: Topic 6 (Sutras 33-36)
Refutation of the Jaina Doctrine
```
**Z¡H$pñ_Þgå^dmV²Ÿ&**

**Naikasminnasambhavat** II.2.33 (204)

On account of the impossibility (of contradictory attributes) in
one and the same thing at the same time (the Jaina doctrine is)
not (to be accepted).

**Na:** not; **Ekasmin:** in one; **Asambhavat:** on account of the
impossibility.

Af ter the ref u ta tion of the Buddhistic doc trine of mo men tari ness,
Vijnanavada and Ni hil ism, the Jaina doc trine is taken up for dis cus -
sion and ref u ta tion.
The Jainas ac knowl edge seven cat e go ries or Tattvas, viz.,
soul(Jiva), non-soul (Ajiva), the is su ing out ward(Asrava), re straint
(Samvara), de struc tion (Nirjara), bond age (Bandha), and re lease
(Moksha). These cat e go ries can be mainly di vided into two groups,
the soul and the non-soul. The Jainas say also that there are five
Astikayas viz., Jiva or soul, Pudgala (body, mat ter), Dharma (merit),
Adharma (de merit) and Akasa (space).
Their chief doc trine is the Saptabhanginyaya. They pred i cate
seven dif fer ent views with ref er ence to the re al ity of ev ery thing, i.e., it
may ex ist, may not ex ist, may ex ist and may not ex ist, may be in ex -
press ible, may ex ist and may be in ex press ible, may not ex ist and may
be in ex press ible and may ex ist and may not ex ist and may be in ex -
press ible.
Now this view about things can not be ac cepted, be cause in one
sub stance it is not pos si ble that con tra dic tory qual i ties should ex ist si -
mul ta neously. No one ever sees the same ob ject to be hot and cold at
the same time. Si mul ta neous ex is tence of light and dark ness in one
place is im pos si ble.
Ac cord ing to the Jaina doc trine, heaven and lib er a tion may ex ist
or may not ex ist. This world, heaven and even lib er a tion will be come
doubt ful. We can not ar rive at any def i nite knowl edge. It would be use -
less to lay down rules of prac tice for the at tain ment of heaven, for the
avoid ance of hell or for eman ci pa tion be cause there is no cer tainty
about any thing. The heaven may as well be hell and fi nal free dom not
dif fer ent from these. As ev ery thing is am big u ous, there would be
noth ing to dis tin guish heaven, hell and fi nal lib er a tion from each
other.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 223
```

Con fu sion will arise not only with re gard to the ob ject of the
world, but of the world also. If things are in def i nite, and if ev ery thing is
“some how it is, some how it is not,” then a man who wants wa ter will
take fire to quench his thirst and so on with ev ery thing else, be cause it
may be that fire is hot, it may be that fire is cold.
If there is such doubt how can true knowl edge re sult? How can
the Jaina teach ers teach any thing with cer tainty if ev ery thing is doubt -
ful? How can their fol low ers act at all, learn ing such teach ings?
Ap ply ing this Saptabhanginyaya to their five Astikayas, the five
may be come four or even less. If they are in ex press ible, why do they
talk about it?
We have al ready re futed the atomic the ory on which is based
the Jaina doc trine that Pudgala (mat ter) is due to atomic com bi na tion.
Hence the Jaina doc trine is un ten a ble and in ad mis si ble. Their
logic is frag ile as the thread of a spi der and can not stand the strain of
rea son ing.

**Ed§ MmË_mH$mËñÝ`©_²Ÿ&**

**Evam chatmakartsnyam** II.2.34 (205)

And in the same way (there results from the Jaina doctrine) the
non-universality of the soul.

**Evam:** thus, in the same way, as it is suggested by the Jaina theory;
**Cha:** also, and; **Atma-akartsnyam:** non-universality of the soul.

Other de fects of the Jaina the ory are shown.
We have hith erto spo ken about the ob jec tion re sult ing from the
Syadvada of the Jainas, viz., that one thing can not have con tra dic tory
at trib utes. We now turn to the ob jec tion that from their doc trine it
would fol low that the in di vid ual soul is not uni ver sal, i.e., not om ni -
pres ent.
The Jainas hold that the soul is of the size of the body. In that
case it would be lim ited and with parts. Hence it can not be eter nal and
om ni pres ent.
More over, as the bod ies of dif fer ent classes of crea tures are of
dif fer ent sizes, the soul of a man tak ing the body of an el e phant on ac -
count of its past deeds will not be able to fill up that body. The soul of
an ant also will not be able to fill up the body of an el e phant. The soul
of an el e phant will not have suf fi cient space in the body of an ant. A
large por tion of it will have to be out side that body. The soul of a child
or a youth be ing smaller in size will not be able to fill com pletely the
body of a grown-up man.
The sta bil ity of the di men sions of the soul is im paired. The Jaina
the ory it self falls to the ground.
The Jainas may give an an swer that a Jiva has in fi nite limbs and
there fore could ex pand or con tract. But could those in fi nite limbs be in

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 224
```

the same place or not? If they could not, how could they be com -
pressed in a small space? If they could, then all the limbs must be in
the same place and can not ex pand into a big body. More over they
have no right to as sume that a Jiva has in fi nite limbs. What is there to
jus tify the view that a body of lim ited size con tains an in fi nite num ber
of soul par ti cles?
Well then, the Jainas may re ply, let us as sume that by turns
when ever the soul en ters a big body, some par ti cles ac cede to it,
while some with draw from it, when ever it en ters a small body.
To this hy poth e sis, the next Su tra gives a suit able an swer.

**Z M n`m©`mXß`{damoYmo {dH$mam{Xä`...Ÿ&**

**Na cha paryayadapyavirodho vikaradibhyah** II.2.35 (206)

Nor is non-contradiction to be derived from the succession (of
parts according to and departing from the soul to such
different bodies) on account of the change, etc., (of the soul).

**Na:** not; **Cha:** also, and; **Paryayat:** in turn, because of assuming by
succession; **Api:** even; **Avirodhah:** no inconsistency;
**Vikaradibhyah:** on account of change, etc.

Fur ther de fects of the Jaina doc trine are shown in this Su tra.
The Jaina may say that the soul is re ally in def i nite in its size.
There fore when it an i mates the bod ies of an in fant or a youth it has
that size, and when it oc cu pies the bod ies of horses or el e phants it ex -
pands it self to that size. By suc ces sive ex pan sion and di la tion like the
gas it fully oc cu pies the en tire body which an i mates for the time be ing.
Then there is no ob jec tion to our the ory that the soul is of the size of
the body.
Even if you say that the limbs of the soul keep out or come in ac -
cord ing as the body is small or big, you can not get over the ob jec tion
that in such a case the soul will be li a ble to change and con se quently
will not be eter nal. Then any talk of bond age and eman ci pa tion would
be mean ing less. The fu til ity of the ques tion of re lease and of the phi -
los o phy that deals with it would re sult.
If the soul’s limbs can come and go, how could it be dif fer ent in
na ture from the body? So one of these limbs only can be the At man.
Who can fix it? Whence do the limbs of the soul come? Where do they
take rest? They can not spring from the ma te rial el e ments and re-en -
ter the el e ments be cause the soul is im mor tal. The limbs come and
go. The soul will be of an in def i nite na ture and stat ure.
The Jaina may say that al though the soul’s size suc ces sively
changes it may yet be per ma nent. Just as the stream of wa ter is per -
ma nent al though the wa ter con tin u ally changes.
Then the same ob jec tion as that urged against the Bud dhists
will arise. If such a con ti nu ity is not real but is only ap par ent, there will

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 225
```

be no At man at all. We are led back to the doc trine of a gen eral void. If
it is some thing real, the soul will be li a ble to change and hence not
eter nal. This will ren der the view of the Jaina im pos si ble.

**AÝË`mdpñWVoümo^`{ZË`ËdmX{deof...Ÿ&**

**Antyavasthiteschobhayanityatvadavisesah** II.2.36 (207)

And on account of the permanency of the final (size of the soul
on release) and the resulting permanency of the two (preceding
sizes), there is no difference (of size of the soul, at any time).

**Antyavasthiteh:** because of the permanency of the size at the end;
**Cha:** and; **Ubhayanityatvat:** as both are permanent; **Aviseshah:**
because there being no difference.

Dis cus sion on the de fects of the Jaina doc trine is con cluded.
Fur ther the Jainas them selves ad mit the per ma nency of the fi -
nal size of the soul, which it has in the stage of re lease. From this it fol -
lows also that its ini tial size and its in ter ven ing size must be
per ma nent. There fore there is no dif fer ence be tween the three sizes.
What is the spe ci al ity of the state of re lease? There is no pe cu liar ity of
dif fer ence, ac cord ing to the Jainas, be tween the state of re lease and
the mun dane state. The dif fer ent bod ies of the soul have one and the
same size and the soul can not en ter into big ger and smaller bod ies.
The soul must be re garded as be ing al ways of the same size, whether
min ute or in fi nite and not of the vary ing sizes of the bod ies.
There fore the Jaina doc trine that the soul var ies ac cord ing to
the size of the body is un ten a ble and in ad mis si ble. It must be set
aside as not in any way more ra tio nal than the doc trine of the
Bauddhas.

**Patyurasamanjasyat** II.2.37 (208)

The Lord (cannot be the efficient or the operative cause of the
world) on account of the inconsistency (of that doctrine).

**Patyuh:** of the Lord, of Pasupati, of the Lord of animals;
**Asamanjasyat:** on account of inconsistency, on account of
untenableness, inappropriateness.

The Pasupatas or the Mahesvaras are di vided into four classes,
viz., Kapala, Kalamukha, Pasupata and Saiva. Their scrip ture de -
scribes five cat e go ries, viz., Cause (Ka ra na), Ef fect (Karya), Un ion
(Yoga by the prac tice of med i ta tion), Rit ual (Vidhi) and the end of pain
or sor row (Duhkhanta), i.e., the fi nal eman ci pa tion. Their cat e go ries
were re vealed by the great Lord Pasupati Him self in or der to break
the bonds of the soul called herein Pasu or an i mal.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 226
```

In this sys tem Pasupati is the op er a tive or the ef fi cient cause
(Nimitta Ka ra na). Mahat and the rest are the ef fects. Un ion means un -
ion with Pasupati, their God, through ab stract med i ta tion. Their rit u als
con sist of bath ing thrice a day, smear ing the fore head with ashes,
interturning the fin gers in re li gious wor ship (Mudra), wear ing
Rudraksha on the neck and arms, tak ing food in a hu man skull,
smear ing the body with ashes of a burnt hu man body, wor ship ping
the de ity im mersed in a wine-ves sel. By wor ship ping the Pasupati the
soul at tains prox im ity with the Lord, and there ac crues a state of ces -
sa tion of all de sires and all pains which is Moksha.
The fol low ers of this school re cog nise God as the ef fi cient or the
op er a tive cause. They re cog nise the pri mor dial mat ter as the ma te rial
cause of the world. This the ory is con trary to the view of the Sruti
where Brah man is stated to be both the ef fi cient and the ma te rial
cause of the world. Hence the the ory of Pasupatas can not be ac -
cepted.
Ac cord ing to Vedanta, the Lord is both the ef fi cient and the ma -
te rial cause of the uni verse. The Naiyayikas, Vaiseshikas, Yogins and
Mahesvaras say that the Lord is the ef fi cient cause only and the ma te -
rial cause is ei ther the at oms, ac cord ing to the Naiyayikas and
Vaiseshikas, or the Pradhana, ac cord ing to the Yogins and
Mahesvaras. He is the ruler of the Pradhana and the souls which are
dif fer ent from Him.
This view is wrong and in con sis tent. Be cause God will be par tial
to some and prej u diced against oth ers. Be cause some are pros per -
ous, while oth ers are mis er a ble in this uni verse. You can not ex plain
this say ing that such dif fer ence is due to di ver sity of Karma, for if the
Lord di rects Karma, they will be come mu tu ally de pend ent. You can -
not ex plain this on the ground of beginninglessness, for the de fect of
mu tual de pend ence will per sist.
Your doc trine is in ap pro pri ate be cause you hold the Lord to be a
spe cial kind of soul. From this it fol lows that He must be de void of all
ac tiv ity.
The Sutrakara him self has proved in the pre vi ous Sec tion of this
book that the Lord is the ma te rial cause as well as the ruler of the
world (ef fi cient or the op er a tive cause).
It is im pos si ble that the Lord should be the mere ef fi cient cause
of the world, be cause His con nec tion with the world can not be es tab -
lished. In or di nary worldly life we see that a pot ter who is merely the
ef fi cient cause of the pot has a cer tain con nec tion with the clay with
which he fash ions the pot.
The Srutis em phat i cally de clare ‘I will be come many’ (Tait. Up.
II.6). This in di cates that the Lord is both the ef fi cient and the ma te rial
cause of the uni verse.

**Sambandhanupapattescha** II.2.38 (209)

And because relation (between the Lord and the Pradhana or

the souls) is not possible.

**Sambandha:** relation; **Anupapatteh:** because of the impossibility;
**Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment against the Pasupata view is con tin ued.
A Lord who is dis tinct from the Pradhana and the souls can not
be the ruler of the lat ter with out be ing con nected with them in a cer tain
way. It can not be con junc tion (Samyoga), be cause the Lord, the
Pradhana and the souls are of in fi nite ex tent and des ti tute of parts.
Hence they can not be ruled by Him.
There could not be Samavaya-sambandha (in her ence) which
sub sists be tween en ti ties in sep a ra bly con nected as whole and part,
sub stance and at trib utes etc., (as in the case of Tantu-pata, thread
and cloth), be cause it would be im pos si ble to de fine who should be
the abode and who the abid ing thing.
The dif fi culty does not arise in the case of the Vedantins. They
say that Brah man is Abhinna-Nimitta-Upadana, the ef fi cient cause
and the ma te rial cause of the world. They af firm
Tadatmya-sambandha (re la tion of iden tity). Fur ther they de pend on
the Srutis for their au thor ity. They de fine the na ture of the cause and
so on, on the ba sis of Sruti. They are, there fore, not obliged to ren der
their ten ets en tirely con form able to ob ser va tion as the op po nents
have to.
The Pasupatas can not say that they have the sup port of the
Aga ma (Tan tras) for af firm ing Om ni science about God. Such a state -
ment suf fers from the de fect of a log i cal see-saw ( _pe titio principii_ ), be -
cause the om ni science of the Lord is es tab lished on the doc trine of
the scrip ture and the au thor ity of the scrip ture is again es tab lished on
the om ni science of the Lord.
For all these rea sons, such doc trines of Sankhyayoga about the
Lord is de void of foun da tion and is in cor rect. Other sim i lar doc trines
which like wise are not based on the Veda are to be re futed by cor re -
spond ing ar gu ments.

The ar gu ment against the Pasupata view is con tin ued.
```
```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 228
```

The Lord of the ar gu men ta tive phi los o phers, such as
Naiyayikas, etc., is un ten a ble hy poth e sis. There is an other log i cal fal -
lacy in the Nyaya con cep tion of Isvara. They say that the Lord cre ates
the world with the help of Pradhana, etc., just as a pot ter makes pots
with the mud.
But this can not be ad mit ted, be cause the Pradhana which is de -
void of col our and other qual i ties and there fore not an ob ject of per -
cep tion, is on that ac count of an en tirely dif fer ent na ture from clay and
the like. There fore, it can not be looked upon as the ob ject of the
Lord’s ac tion. The Lord can not di rect the Pradhana.
There is an other mean ing also for this Su tra. In this world we
see a king with a body and never a king with out a body. There fore, the
Lord also must have a body which will serve as the sub stra tum of his
or gans. How can we as cribe a body to the Lord, be cause a body is
only pos te rior to cre ation?
The Lord, there fore, is not able to act be cause he is de void of a
ma te rial sub stra tum, be cause ex pe ri ence teaches us that ac tion
needs a ma te rial sub stra tum. If we as sume that the Lord pos sesses
some kind of body which serves as a sub stra tum for his or gans prior
to cre ation, this as sump tion also will not do, be cause if the Lord has a
body He is sub ject to the sen sa tions of the or di nary souls and thus no
lon ger is the Lord.
The Lord’s putt ing on a body also can not be es tab lished. So the
Lord of an i mals (Pasupati) can not be the ruler of mat ter (Pradhana).
That by putt ing on a body the Lord be comes the ef fi cient cause of the
world is also fal la cious. In the world it is ob served that a pot ter hav ing
a bodily form fash ions a pot with the clay. If from this anal ogy the Lord
is in ferred to be the ef fi cient cause of the world, He is to be ad mit ted to
have a bodily form. But all bod ies are per ish able. Even the Pasupatas
ad mit that the Lord is eter nal. It is un ten a ble that the eter nal Lord re -
sides in a per ish able body and so be comes de pend ent on an other
ad di tional cause. Hence it can not be in ferred that the Lord has any
bodily form.
There is still an other mean ing. Fur ther, there is in his case the
im pos si bil ity (ab sence) of place. For an agent like the pot ter etc.,
stands on the ground and does his work. He has a place to stand
upon. Pasupati does not pos sess that.

or gans which are not per ceived, so also the Lord rules the Pradhana,
etc.
The anal ogy is not cor rect, be cause the in di vid ual soul feels
plea sure and pain. If the anal ogy be true, the Lord also would ex pe ri -
ence plea sure and pain, caused by the Pradhana etc., and hence
would for feit His God head.

**Asarvajnata:** absence of Omniscience; **Va:** or.

The ar gu ment raised in Su tra 40 is fur ther re futed and thus the
Pasupata doc trine is re futed.
Ac cord ing to these schools (Nyaya, Pasupata, the Mahesvara,
etc.), the Lord is Om ni scient and eter nal. The Lord, the Pradhana and
the souls are in fi nite and sep a rate. Does the Om ni scient Lord know
the mea sure of the Pradhana, soul and Him self or not? If the Lord
knows their mea sure, they all are lim ited. There fore a time will come
when they will all cease to ex ist. If Samsara ends and thus there is no
more Pradhana, of what can God be the ba sis or His lord ship? Or,
over what is His Om ni science to ex tend? If na ture and souls are fi nite,
they must have a be gin ning. If they have a be gin ning and end, there
will be scope for Sunyavada, the doc trine of noth ing ness. If He does
not know them, then he would no lon ger be Om ni scient. In ei ther case
the doc trine of the Lord’s be ing the mere ef fi cient cause of the world is
un ten a ble, in con sis tent and un ac cept able.
If God be ad mit ted to have or gans of senses and so to be sub -
ject to plea sure and pain, as stated in Su tra 40, He is sub ject to birth
and death like an or di nary man. He be comes de void of Om ni science.
This sort of God is not ac cepted by the Pasupatas even. Hence the
doc trine of the Pasupatas, that God is not the ma te rial cause of the
world can not be ac cepted.

BRAHMA SUTRAS 230

On account of the impossibility of the origination (of the

individual soul from the Highest Lord), (the doctrine of the

Bhagavatas or the Pancharatra doctrine cannot be accepted).

**Utpatti:** causation, origination, creation; **Asambhavat:** on account of

the impossibility.

```
The Pancharatra doc trine or the doc trine of the Bhagavatas is
```
now re futed.

Ac cord ing to this school, the Lord is the ef fi cient cause as well
as the ma te rial cause of the uni verse. This is in quite agree ment with
the scrip ture or the Sruti and so it is au thor i ta tive. A part of their sys -
tem agrees with the Vedanta sys tem. We ac cept this. An other part of
the sys tem, how ever, is open to ob jec tion.

The Bhagavatas say that Vaasudeva whose na ture is pure
knowl edge is what re ally ex ists. He di vides Him self four fold and ap -
pears in four forms (Vyuhas) as Vaasudeva, Sankarshana,
Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Vaasudeva de notes the Su preme Self,
Sankarshana the in di vid ual soul, Pradyumna the mind, and
Aniruddha the prin ci ple of ego ism, or Ahamkara. Of these four,
Vaasudeva con sti tutes the Ul ti mate Cause, of which the three oth ers
are the ef fects.

They say that by de vo tion for a long pe riod to Vaasudeva
through Abhigamana (go ing to the tem ple with de vo tion), Upadana
(se cur ing the ac ces so ries of wor ship), Ijya (ob la tion, wor ship),
Svadhyaya (study of holy scrip ture and rec i ta tion of Mantras) and
Yoga (de vout med i ta tion) we can pass be yond all af flic tions, pains
and sor rows, at tain Lib er a tion and reach the Su preme Be ing. We ac -
cept this doc trine.

But we con tro vert the doc trine that Sankarshana (the Jiva) is
born from Vaasudeva and so on. Such cre ation is not pos si ble. If
there is such birth, if the soul be cre ated it would be sub ject to de -
struc tion and hence there could be no Lib er a tion. That the soul is not
cre ated will be shown in Su tra II.3.17.
For this rea son the Pancharatra doc trine is not ac cept able.

instrument.

CHAPTER II—SECTION 2 231
```

An in stru ment such as a hatchet and the like is not seen to be
pro duced from the agent, the wood cut ter. But the Bhagavatas teach
that from an agent, viz., the in di vid ual soul termed Sankarshana,
there springs its in ter nal in stru ment or mind (Pradyumna) and from
the mind, the ego or Ahamkara (Aniruddha).

The mind is the in stru ment of the soul. No where do we see the
in stru ment be ing born from the doer. Nor can we ac cept that
Ahamkara is sues from the mind. This doc trine can not be ac cepted.

Such doc trine can not be set tled with out ob served in stances. We do
not meet with any scrip tural pas sage in its fa vour. The scrip ture de -
clares that ev ery thing takes its or i gin from Brah man.

**Vijnanadibhave va tadapratishedhah** II.2.44 (215)

Or if the (four Vyuhas are said to) possess infinite knowledge,
etc., yet there is no denial of that (viz., the objection raised in
Sutra 42).

**Vijnanadibhave:** if intelligence etc. exist; **Va:** or, on the other hand;
**Tat:** that ( _Tasya iti_ ); **Apratishedhah:** no denial (of). ( **Vijnana:**
knowledge; **Adi:** and the rest; **Bhave:** of the nature (of).)

The ar gu ment against the Pancharatra doc trine is con tin ued.
The er ror of the doc trine will per sist even if they say that all the
Vyuhas are gods hav ing in tel li gence, etc.

The Bhagavatas may say, that all the forms are Vaasudeva, the
Lord, and that all of them equally pos sess Knowl edge, Lord ship,
Strength, Power, etc., and are free from faults and im per fec tions.

In this case there will be more than one Isvara. This goes
against your own doc trine ac cord ing to which there is only one real
es sence, viz., the holy Vaasudeva. All the work can be done by only

One Lord. Why should there be four Isvaras?
More over, there could be no birth of one from an other, be cause

they are equal ac cord ing to the Bhagavatas, whereas a cause is al -
ways greater than the ef fect. Ob ser va tion shows that the re la tion of
cause and ef fect re quires some su pe ri or ity on the part of the cause,
as for in stance, in the case of the clay and the pot, where the cause is
more ex ten sive than the ef fect and that with out such su pe ri or ity the
re la tion is sim ply im pos si ble. The Bhagavatas do not ac knowl edge

any dif fer ence founded on su pe ri or ity of knowl edge, power, etc., be -
tween Vaasudeva and the other Lords, but sim ply say that they are all
forms of Vaasudeva with out any spe cial dis tinc tion.

Then again, the forms of Vaasudeva can not be lim ited to four
only, as the whole world from Brahma down to a blade of grass is a

```

form or man i fes ta tion of the Su preme Be ing. The whole world is the
Vyuha of Vaasudeva.

**Vipratishedhaccha** II.2.45 (216)
And because of contradictions (the Pancharatra doctrine is
untenable).

**Vipratishedhat:** because of contradiction; **Cha:** and.

The ar gu ment against the doc trine of the Bhagavatas is con -
cluded here.
There are also other in con sis ten cies, or man i fold con tra dic tions
in the Pancharatra doc trine. Jnana, Aisvarya, or rul ing ca pac ity, Sakti
(cre ative power), Bala (strength), Virya (val our) and Tejas (glory) are
enu mer ated as qual i ties and they are again in some other place spo -
ken of as selfs, holy Vaasudevas and so on. It says that Vaasudeva is
dif fer ent from Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Yet it says
that these are the same as Vaasudeva. Some times it speaks of the
four forms as qual i ties of the At man and some times as the At man it -
self.
Fur ther we meet with pas sages con tra dic tory to the Vedas. It
con tains words of de pre ci a tion of the Vedas. It says that Sandilya got
the Pancharatra doc trine af ter find ing that the Vedas did not con tain
the means of per fec tion. Not hav ing found the high est bliss in the
Vedas, Sandilya stud ied this Sastra.
For this rea son also the Bhagavata doc trine can not be ac -
cepted. As this sys tem is op posed to and con demned by all the Srutis
and abhored by the wise, it is not wor thy of re gard.
Thus in this Pada has been shown that the paths of Sankhyas,
Vaiseshikas and the rest down to the Pancharatra doc trine are strewn
with thorns and are full of dif fi cul ties, while the path of Vedanta is free
from all these de fects and should be trod den by ev ery one who wishes
his fi nal be at i tude and sal va tion.

INTRODUCTION
```
In the pre vi ous Sec tion the in con sis tency of the doc trines of the
var i ous non-Vedantic schools has been shown. Af ter show ing the
untenability and un re li abil ity of other sys tems, Sri Vyasa, the au thor of
Vedanta Sutras now pro ceeds to ex plain the ap par ent con tra dic tions
and in con sis ten cies in the Sruti sys tem be cause there ap pear to be
di ver si ties of doc trines with ref er ence to the or i gin of the el e ments,
the senses, etc.
We now clearly un der stand that other philo soph i cal doc trines
are worth less on ac count of their mu tual con tra dic tions. Now a sus pi -
cion may arise that the Vedantic doc trine also is equally worth less on
ac count of its in trin sic con tra dic tions. There fore a new dis cus sion is
be gun in or der to re move all doubts in the Vedanta pas sages which
re fer to cre ation and thus to re move the sus pi cion in the minds of the
read ers. Here we have to con sider first the ques tion whether ether
(Akasa) has an or i gin or not.
In Sec tions III and IV the ap par ent con tra dic tions in Sruti texts
are beau ti fully har mo nised and rec on ciled. The ar gu ments of the op -
po nent (Purvapakshin) who at tempts to prove the Self-con tra dic tion
of the scrip tural texts are given first. Then co mes the ref u ta tion by the

**SYNOPSIS**
The Third Sec tion of Chap ter II deals with the or der of cre ation
as it is taught in Sruti, of the five pri mal el e ments namely Akasa, air,
fire, wa ter and earth. It dis cusses the ques tion whether the el e ments
have an or i gin or not, whether they are co-eter nal with Brah man or is -
sue from it and are with drawn into it at stated in ter vals. The es sen tial
char ac ter is tics of the in di vid ual is also as cer tained.
The first seven Adhikaranas deal with the five el e men tary sub -
stances.
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-7) teaches that the ether is not co-eter -
nal with Brah man but orig i nates from it as its first ef fect. Though there
is no men tion of Akasa in the Chhandogya Upanisad, the in clu sion of
Akasa is im plied.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Su tra 8) shows that air orig i nates from ether.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Su tra 9) teaches that there is no or i gin of that
which is (i.e., Brah man) on ac count of the im pos si bil ity of there be ing
an or i gin of Brah man, and as it does not stand to rea son.
_Adhikarana IV, V, VI_ : (Sutras 10, 11, 12) teach that fire springs
from air, wa ter from fire, earth from wa ter.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Su tra 13) teaches that the orig i na tion of one el -
e ment from an other is due not to the lat ter in it self but to Brah man act -
ing in it. Brah man who is their Indweller has ac tu ally evolved these
suc ces sive el e ments.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Su tra 14) shows that the ab sorp tion of the el e -
ments into Brah man takes place in the in verse or der of their cre ation.
_Adhikarana IX:_ (Su tra 15) teaches that the or der in which the
cre ation and the re-ab sorp tion of the el e ments takes place is not in -
ter fered with by the cre ation and re-ab sorp tion of Prana, mind and the
senses, be cause they also are the cre ations of Brah man, and are of
el e men tal na ture and there fore are cre ated and ab sorbed to gether
with the el e ments of which they con sist.
The re main ing por tion of this Sec tion is de voted to the spe cial
char ac ter is tics of the in di vid ual soul by com par ing dif fer ent Srutis
bear ing on this point.
_Adhikarana X:_ (Su tra 16) shows that ex pres sions such as
“Ramakrishna is born” “Ramakrishna has died”, strictly ap ply to the
body only and are trans ferred to the soul in so far only as it is con -
nected with a body.
_Adhikarana XI:_ (Su tra 17) teaches that the in di vid ual soul is ac -
cord ing to the Srutis per ma nent, eter nal. There fore it is not like the
ether and the other el e ments, pro duced from Brah man at the time of

```

```

cre ation. The Jiva is in re al ity iden ti cal with Brah man. What orig i nates
is merely the soul’s con nec tion with its lim it ing ad juncts such as mind,
body, senses, etc. This con nec tion is more over il lu sory.
_Adhikarana XII:_ (Su tra 18) de fines the na ture of the in di vid ual
soul. The Su tra de clares that in tel li gence is the very es sence of the
soul.
_Adhikarana XIII:_ (Sutras 19-32) deals with the ques tion whether
the in di vid ual soul is Anu, i.e., of very min ute size or om ni pres ent,
all-per vad ing. The Sutras 19-28 rep re sent the view of the
Purvapakshin ac cord ing to which the in di vid ual soul is Anu, while Su -
tra 29 for mu lates the Siddhanta viz., the in di vid ual soul is in re al ity
all-per vad ing; it is spo ken of as Anu in some scrip tural pas sages be -
cause the qual i ties of the in ter nal or gan it self are Anu which con sti tute
the es sence of the Jiva so long as he is in volved in the Samsara.
Su tra 30 ex plains that the soul may be called Anu as it is con -
nected with the Buddhi as long as it is im pli cated in the Samsara.
Su tra 31 in ti mates that in the state of deep sleep the soul is po -
ten tially con nected with the Buddhi while in the wak ing state that con -
nec tion be comes ac tu ally man i fest.
Su tra 32 in ti mates that if no in tel lect ex isted there would re sult
con stant per cep tion or con stant non-per cep tion.
_Adhikaranas XIV and XV:_ (Sutras 33-39 and 40) re fer to the
Kartritva of the in di vid ual soul, whether the soul is an agent or not.
Sutras 33-39 de clare that the soul is an agent. The soul is an
agent when he is con nected with the in stru ments of ac tion, Buddhi,
etc. Su tra 40 in ti mates that he ceases to be an agent when he is dis -
so ci ated from them, just as the car pen ter works as long as he wields
his in stru ments and rests af ter hav ing laid them aside.
_Adhikarana XVI:_ (Sutras 41-42) teaches that the agentship of
the in di vid ual soul is ver ily sub or di nate to and con trolled by the Su -
preme Lord. The Lord al ways di rects the soul ac cord ing to his good or
bad ac tions done in pre vi ous births.
_Adhikarana XVII_ (Sutras 43-53) treats of the re la tion of the in di -
vid ual soul to Brah man.
Su tra 43 de clares that the in di vid ual soul is a part (Amsa) of
Brah man. This Su tra pro pounds Avacchedavada i.e., the doc trine of
lim i ta tion i.e., the doc trine that the soul is the Su preme Self in so far as
lim ited by its ad juncts.
The fol low ing Sutras in ti mate that the Su preme Lord is not af -
fected by plea sure and pain like the in di vid ual soul, just as light is un -
af fected by the shak ing of its re flec tions.
Ac cord ing to Sankara, ‘Amsa’ must be un der stood to mean
‘Amsa iva’, a part as it were. The one uni ver sal in di vis i ble Brah man

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 236
```

has no real parts but ap pears to be di vided ow ing to its lim it ing ad -
juncts.
Su tra 47 teaches that the in di vid ual souls are re quired to fol low
the dif fer ent in junc tions and pro hi bi tions laid down in the scrip tures,
when they are con nected with bod ies, high and low. Fire is one only
but the fire of a fu neral pyre is re jected and that of the sac ri fice is ac -
cepted. Sim i lar is the case with the At man. When the soul is at tached
to the body, eth i cal rules, ideas of pu rity and im pu rity have full ap pli ca -
tion.
Su tra 49 shows that there is no con fu sion of ac tions or faults of
ac tions. The in di vid ual soul has no con nec tion with all the bod ies at
the same time. He is con nected with one body only and he is af fected
by the pe cu liar prop er ties of that one alone.
Su tra 50 pro pounds the doc trine of re flec tion (Abhasavada) or
Pratibimbavada, the doc trine that the in di vid ual soul is a mere re flec -
tion of the Su preme Brah man in the Buddhi or in tel lect.
In the Sankhya phi los o phy the in di vid ual soul has been stated to
be all-per vad ing. If this view be ac cepted there would be con fu sion of
works and their ef fects. This view of the Sankhyas is, there fore, an
un fair con clu sion.

```
Viyadadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-7)
Ether is not eternal but created
```
**Z {d`XlwVo...Ÿ&**

**Na viyadasruteh** II.3.1 (217)

(The Purvapakshin, i.e., the objector says that) ether (Akasa)
(does) not (originate), as Sruti does not say so.

**Na:** not; **Viyat:** ether, space, Akasa; **Asruteh:** as Sruti does not say
so.

The op po nent raises a con ten tion that Akasa is uncreated and
as such not pro duced out of Brah man. This _prima fa cie_ view is set
aside in the next Su tra.
To be gin with, the texts which treat of cre ation are taken up.
Akasa (ether) is first dealt with. The Purvapakshin says that Akasa is
not caused or cre ated be cause there is no Sruti to that ef fect. Akasa is
eter nal and is not caused be cause the Sruti does not call it caused,
while it re fers to the cre ation of fire. “ _Tadaikshata bahu syam
prajayeyeti tattejo’srijata_ ” “It thought ‘May I be come many, may I grow
forth’—It sent forth fire”. (Chh. Up. VI.2.3). Here there is no men tion of
Akasa be ing pro duced by Brah man. As scrip tural sen tence is our only
au thor ity in the orig i na tion of knowl edge of supersensuous things,
and as there is no scrip tural state ment de clar ing the or i gin of ether,
ether must be con sid ered to have no or i gin. There fore Akasa has no
or i gin. It is eter nal.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 237
```

In the Vedantic texts, we come across in dif fer ent places dif fer -
ent state ments re gard ing the or i gin of var i ous things. Some texts say
that the ether and air orig i nated; some do not. Some other texts again

make sim i lar state ments re gard ing the in di vid ual soul and the Pranas
(vi tal airs). In some places the Sruti texts con tra dict one an other re -
gard ing or der of suc ces sion and the like.

**ApñV VwŸ&**

**Asti tu** II.3.2 (218)

But there is (a Sruti text which states that Akasa is created).

**Asti:** there is; **Tu:** but.

The con tra dic tion raised in Su tra 1 is par tially met here.
The word ‘but’ (tu) is used in this Su tra in or der to re move the
doubt raised in the pre ced ing Su tra.
But there is a Sruti which ex pressly says so. Though there is no

state ment in the Chhandogya Upanishad re gard ing the cau sa tion of
Akasa, yet there is a pas sage in the Taittiriya Sruti on its cau sa tion:
_“Tasmad va etasmadatmana akasah sambhutah”_ —“From the Self

(Brah man) sprang Akasa, from Akasa the air, from air the fire, from
fire the wa ter, from wa ter the earth (Tait. Up. II.1).”

**Jm¡Ê`gå^dmV²Ÿ&**

**Gaunyasambhavat** II.3.3 (219)
(The Sruti text concerning the origination of Akasa) has a
secondary sense, on account of the impossibility (of the
origination of the Akasa).

**Gauni:** used in a secondary sense, having a metaphorical sense;
**Asambhavat:** because of the impossibility.

Here is an ob jec tion against Su tra 20.
The op po nent says: The Taittiriya text re ferred to in the pre vi ous
Su tra which de clares the orig i na tion of the Akasa should be taken in a
sec ond ary sense (fig u ra tive), as Akasa can not be cre ated. It has no

parts. There fore it can not be cre ated.
The Vaiseshikas deny that Akasa was caused. They say that
cau sa tion im plies three fac tors, viz., Samavayikarana (in her ent
causes—many and sim i lar fac tors), Asamavayikarana (non-in her ent

causes, their com bi na tion) and Nimittakarana (op er a tive causes, a
hu man agency). To make a cloth, threads and their com bi na tion and a
weaver are needed. Such causal fac tors do not ex ist in the case of

Akasa.
We can not pred i cate of space a spaceless state, just as we can
pred i cate of fire an an te ced ent state with out bright ness.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 238
```

Fur ther un like earth, etc., Akasa is all-per vad ing and hence
could not have been caused or cre ated. It is eter nal. It is with out or i -
gin.
The word ‘Akasa’ is used in a sec ond ary sense in such phrases
as ‘make room’, ‘there is room’. Al though space is only one, it is des -
ig nated as be ing of dif fer ent kinds when we speak of the space of a
pot, the space of a house. Even in Ve dic pas sages a form of ex pres -
sion such as ‘He is to place the wild an i mals in the spaces
(Akaseshu)’ is seen. Hence we con clude that those Sruti texts also
which speak of the orig i na tion of Akasa must be taken to have a sec -
ond ary sense or fig u ra tive mean ing.

**eãXmƒŸ&**

**Sabdaccha** II.3.4 (220)

Also from the Sruti texts (we find that Akasa is eternal).

**Sabdat:** from the Sruti texts, because Sruti says so; **Cha:** also, and.

Here is an ob jec tion against Su tra 2.
In the pre vi ous Su tra Akasa was in ferred to be eter nal. In this
Su tra the op po nent cites a Sruti text to show that it is eter nal. He
points out that Sruti de scribes Akasa as uncaused and uncreated.
“ _Vayuschantariksham chaitadamritam_ ”—“The air and the Akasa are
im mor tal” (Br. Up. II.3.3). What is im mor tal can not have an or i gin.
An other scrip tural pas sage, “Om ni pres ent and eter nal like
ether”—“ _Akasavat sarvagato nityah_ ”, in di cates that those two qual i -
ties of Brah man be long to the ether also. Hence an or i gin can not be
at trib uted to the Akasa.
Other scrip tural pas sages are: “As this Akasa is in fi nite, so the
Self is to be known as in fi nite.” “Brah man has the ether for its body,
the Akasa is the Self.” If the Akasa had a be gin ning it could not be
pred i cated of Brah man as we pred i cate blue ness of a lo tus (lo tus is
blue).
There fore the eter nal Brah man is of the same na ture as Akasa.
(This is the view of the op po nent—Purvapakshin).

**ñ`mƒ¡H$ñ` ~«÷eãXdV² &**

**Syacchaikasya Brahmasabdavat** II.3.5 (221)

It is possible that the one word (‘sprang’—Sambhutah) may be
used in a secondary and primary sense like the word
Brahman.

**Syat:** is possible; **Cha:** also, and; **Ekasya:** of the one and the same
word; **Brahmasabdavat:** like the word Brahman.

An ar gu ment in sup port of the above ob jec tion is now ad vanced
by the op po nent (Purvapakshin).

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 239
```

The op po nent says that the same word ‘sprang’ (Sambhutah) in
the Taittiriya text (II.1)—“From that Brah man sprang Akasa, from
Akasa sprang air, from air sprang fire.”—can be used in a sec ond ary
sense with re spect to Akasa and in the pri mary sense with re spect to
air, fire, etc. He sup ports his state ment by mak ing ref er ence to other
Sruti texts where the word ‘Brah man’ is so used. “Try to know Brah -
man by pen ance, be cause, pen ance is Brah man” (Tait. Up. III.2).
Here Brah man is used both in a pri mary and in a sec ond ary sense in
the same text.
The same word Brah man is in the way of fig u ra tive iden ti fi ca tion
(Bhakti) ap plied to pen ance which is only the means of know ing Brah -
man and again di rectly to Brah man as the ob ject of knowl edge.
Also “Food is Brah man— _Annam Brahma_ ” (Tait. Up. III.2), and
“Bliss is Brah man— _Anando Brahma_ ” (Tait. Up. III.6). Here Brah man
is used in a sec ond ary and pri mary sense re spec tively in two com ple -
men tary texts.
The Vedantin says: But how can we up hold now the va lid ity of
the state ment made in the clause, “Brah man is one only with out a
sec ond— _Ekameva Advitiyam Brahma_ ”. Be cause if Akasa is a sec -
ond en tity co-ex ist ing with Brah man from eter nity, it fol lows that Brah -
man has a sec ond. If it is so, how can it be said that when Brah man is
known ev ery thing is known? (Chh. Up. VI.1.3).
The op po nent re plies that the words “ _Ekameva_ —one only” are
used with ref er ence to the ef fects. Just as when a man sees in a pot -
ter’s house a lump of clay, a staff, a wheel and so on to day and on the
fol low ing day a num ber of pots and says that clay alone ex isted on the
pre vi ous day, he means only that the ef fects, i.e., the pots did not ex ist
and does not deny the wheel or the stick of the pot ter, even so the
pas sage means only that there is no other cause for Brah man which
is the ma te rial cause of the world. The term ‘with out a sec ond’ does
not ex clude the ex is tence from eter nity of ether but ex cludes the ex is -
tence of any other su per in tend ing Be ing but Brah man. There is a su -
per in tend ing pot ter in ad di tion to the ma te rial cause of the ves sels,
i.e., the clay. But there is no other su per in ten dent in ad di tion to Brah -
man, the ma te rial cause of the uni verse.
The op po nent fur ther adds that the ex is tence of Akasa will not
bring about the ex is tence of two things, for num ber co mes in only
when there are di verse things. Brah man and Akasa have no such di -
verse ness be fore cre ation as both are all-per vad ing and in fi nite and
are in dis tin guish able like milk and wa ter mixed to gether. There fore
the Sruti says: “ _Akasasariram Brahma_ —Brah man has the ether for its
body”. It fol lows that the two are iden ti cal.
More over all cre ated things are one with Akasa which is one
with Brah man. There fore if Brah man is known with its ef fects, Akasa
also is known.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 240
```

The case is sim i lar to that of a few drops of wa ter poured into a
cup of milk. These drops are taken when the milk is taken. The tak ing
of the drops does not form some thing ad di tional to the tak ing of the
milk. Sim i larly the Akasa which is non-sep a rate in place and time from
Brah man, and its ef fects, is com prised within Brah man. There fore,
we have to un der stand the pas sages about the or i gin of the ether in a
sec ond ary sense.
Thus the op po nent (Purvapakshin) tries to es tab lish that Akasa
is uncreated and is not an ef fect and that the Sruti text calls it
‘Sambhuta’ (cre ated) only in a sec ond ary sense.

**à{Vkm@hm{Zaì`{VaoH$mÀN>ãXoä`...Ÿ&**

**Pratijna’haniravyatirekacchabdebhyah** II.3.6 (222)

The non-abandonment of the proposition (viz., by the
knowledge of one everything else becomes known, can result
only) from the non-difference (of the entire world from
Brahman) according to the words of the Veda or the Sruti texts
(which declare the non-difference of the cause and its effects).

**Pratijna ahanih:** non-abandonment of the proposition; **Avyatirekat:**
from non distinction, on account of non-difference, because of
absence of exclusion; **Sabdebhyah:** from the words namely from the
Srutis.

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 1 and con tin ued in Sutras 3, 4 and
5 is now re plied to.
The Sutrakara re futes the Purvapakshin’s (ob jec tor’s) view and
es tab lishes his po si tion. The scrip tural as ser tion that from the knowl -
edge of One (Brah man) ev ery thing else is known can be true only if
ev ery thing in the world is an ef fect of Brah man. Be cause the Sruti
says that the ef fects are not dif fer ent from the cause, there fore if the
cause (Brah man) is known, the ef fects also will be known. If Akasa
does not orig i nate from Brah man, then by know ing Brah man we can -
not know Akasa. There fore the above as ser tion will not come true.
Akasa still re mains to be known as it is not an ef fect of Brah man. But if
Akasa is cre ated then there will be no such dif fi culty at all. There fore
Akasa is an ef fect. It is cre ated. If it is not cre ated the au thor i ta tive -
ness of the Vedas will dis ap pear.
The op po nent is en tirely wrong in imag in ing that the Taittiriya
Sruti is in con flict with Chhandogya Upanishad. You will have to add in
the Chhandogya Sruti “Af ter cre at ing Akasa and Vayu”. Then the text
would mean that af ter cre at ing Akasa and Vayu “Brah man cre ated
fire.” Now there will be no con flict at all.
More over, the ex pla na tion that as Brah man and Akasa are one
like milk and wa ter and that as Akasa is one with all things it will be
known by know ing Brah man and its ef fects is en tirely wrong, be cause
the knowl edge of milk and wa ter which are one is not a cor rect knowl -

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 241
```

edge. The anal ogy given in the Sruti text is not milk and wa ter, but clay
and jars to in di cate that all ef fects are not sep a rate from the cause
and be cause the word ‘eva’ in “Ekameva Advitiyam” ex cludes two
com bined things like milk and wa ter and says that only one en tity is
the cause.
The knowl edge of ev ery thing through the knowl edge of one
thing of which the Sruti speaks can not be ex plained through the anal -
ogy of milk mixed with wa ter, for we un der stand from the par al lel in -
stance of a piece of clay be ing brought for ward, (Chh. Up. VI.1.4), that
the knowl edge of ev ery thing has to be ex pe ri enced through the re la -
tion of the ma te rial cause and the ma te rial ef fect. The knowl edge of
the cause im plies the knowl edge of the ef fect. Fur ther, the knowl edge
of ev ery thing, if taken to be sim i lar to the case of knowl edge of milk
and wa ter, could not be called a per fect knowl edge
(Samyag-Vijnana), be cause the wa ter which is ap pre hended only
through the knowl edge of the milk with which it is mixed is not grasped
by per fect knowl edge, be cause the wa ter al though mixed with the
milk, yet is dif fer ent from it.
That noth ing has an in de pend ent ex is tence apart from Brah man
is cor rob o rated by state ments in Sruti: “ _Sarvam khalvidam
Brahma_ ”—“ _Idam sarvam yadayamatma_ ”. That Self is all that is (Bri.
Up. II.4.6).

**Yavadvikaram tu vibhago lokavat** II.3.7 (223)
But wherever there are effects, there are separateness as is
seen in the world (as in ordinary life).

**Yavat vikaram:** so far as all modifications go, wherever there is an
effect; **Tu:** but; **Vibhagah:** division, separateness, distinction,
specification; **Lokavat:** as in the world. ( **Yavat:** whatever; **Vikaram:**
transformation.)

The ar gu ment be gun in Su tra 6 is con cluded here.
The word ‘tu’ (but) re futes the idea that Akasa is not cre ated. It
shows that the doubt raised in the last Su tra is be ing re moved.
The Chhandogya Upanishad pur posely omits Akasa and Vayu
from the list enu mer ated, be cause it keeps in view the pro cess of
Trivritkarana, com bi na tion of the three vis i ble el e ments (Murta, i.e.,
with form), in stead of Panchikarana, com bi na tion of five el e ments
which is else where de vel oped.
It is to be noted here that though all the el e ments orig i nate from
Brah man, yet Akasa and air are not men tioned by name in the Sruti,
Chhandogya Upanishad, whereas fire, wa ter and earth are dis tinctly
stated therein to have orig i nated from Brah man. The spec i fi ca tion is
like that found in sim i lar cases of or di nary ex pe ri ence in the world, for

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 242
```

in stance, to mean all the sons of a par tic u lar per son, Ramakrishna,
only a few of them are named.
This is just like what we find in the or di nary world. If a man says
“all these are sons of Narayana” and then he gives cer tain par tic u lars
about the birth of one of them, he im plies thereby that it ap plies to the
birth of all the rest. Even so when the Upanishad says that “all this has
its self in Brah man” and then it goes on to give the or i gin of some of
them from Brah man such as fire, wa ter and earth, it does not mean
that oth ers have not their or i gin in Him, but it only means that it was
not thought nec es sary to give a de tailed ac count of their or i gin.
There fore, though there is no ex press text in the Chhandogya
Upanishad as to the or i gin of Akasa, yet we in fer from the uni ver sal
prop o si tion therein that “ev ery thing has its self in Brah man”, that
Akasa has its self in Brah man, and so is pro duced from Brah man.
Akasa is an el e ment like fire and air. There fore it must have an
or i gin. It is the sub stra tum of im per ma nent qual ity like the sound, and
so it must be im per ma nent. This is the di rect ar gu ment to prove the
or i gin and de struc tion of Akasa. The in di rect ar gu ment to prove it is,
“what ever has no or i gin is eter nal as Brah man” and what ever has
per ma nent qual i ties is eter nal as the soul, but Akasa not be ing like
Brah man in these re spects, can not be eter nal.
Akasa takes its or i gin from Brah man, though we can not con -
ceive how space can have any or i gin.
We see in this uni verse that all cre ated things are dif fer ent from
each other. What ever we ob serve: ef fects or mod i fi ca tions of a sub -
stance such as jars, pots, brace lets, arm lets, and ear-rings, nee dles,
ar rows, and swords we ob serve di vi sion or sep a rate ness. What ever
is di vided or sep a rate is an ef fect, as jars, pots, etc. What ever is not
an ef fect is not di vided as the At man or Brah man. A pot is dif fer ent
from a piece of cloth and so on. Ev ery thing that is di vided or sep a rate
is cre ated. It can not be eter nal. You can not think of a thing as sep a -
rate from oth ers and yet eter nal.
Akasa is sep a rate from earth, etc. Hence Akasa also must be an
ef fect. It can not be eter nal. It must be a cre ated thing.
If you say that At man also, be ing ap par ently sep a rate from
Akasa etc., must be an ef fect we re ply that it is not so, be cause Akasa
it self has orig i nated from At man. The Sruti de clares that “Akasa
sprang from the At man” (Tait. Up. II.1). If At man also is an ef fect,
Akasa etc., will be with out an At man i.e., Svarupa. The re sult will be
Sunyavada or the doc trine of noth ing ness. At man is Be ing, there fore
it can not be neg a tived. _“Atmatvacchatmano nirakarana-
sankanupapattih”._ It is self-ex is tent. _“Na hyatma-gantukah kasyachit,
svayam siddhatvat”._ It is self-ev i dent. “ _Na hyatma atmanah
pramanapekshaya siddhyati_ .”

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 243
```

Akasa etc., are not stated by any one to be self-ex is tent. Hence
no one can deny the At man, be cause the de nier is him self, At man. At -
man ex ists and is eter nal.
The All-per va sive ness and eter nity of Akasa are only rel a tively
true. Akasa is cre ated. It is an ef fect of Brah man.
In the clauses, “I know at the pres ent mo ment what ever is pres -
ent, I knew at for mer mo ments, the nearer and the re moter past; I
shall know in the fu ture, the nearer and re moter fu ture” the ob ject of
knowl edge changes ac cord ing as it is some thing past or some thing
fu ture or some thing pres ent. But the know ing agent does not change
at all as his na ture is eter nal pres ence. As the na ture of the At man is
eter nal pres ence it can not be an ni hi lated even when the body is burnt
to ashes. You can not even think that it ever should be come some -
thing dif fer ent from what it is. Hence the At man or Brah man is not an
ef fect. The Akasa, on the con trary, co mes un der the cat e gory of ef -
fects.
More over, you say that there must be many and sim i lar causal
fac tors be fore an ef fect can be pro duced. This ar gu ment is not cor -
rect. Threads are Dravya (sub stance). Their com bi na tion (Samyoga)
is a Guna (at trib ute) and yet both are fac tors in the pro duc tion of an ef -
fect. Even if you say that the need for many and sim i lar causal fac tors
ap plies only to Samavayikarana, this sort of ex pla na tion is not cor -
rect, for a rope or a car pet is spun out of thread, wool, etc.
More over, why do you say that many causal fac tors are
needed? In the case of Paramanu or ul ti mate atom or mind, the ini tial
ac tiv ity is ad mit tedly not due to many causal fac tors. Nor can you say
that only for a Dravya (sub stance) many causal fac tors are nec es -
sary. That would be so, if com bi na tion causes the ef fect as in the case
of threads and cloth. But in many in stances, (e.g., milk be comes curd)
the same sub stance changes into an other sub stance. It is not the
Lord’s law that only sev eral causes in con junc tion should pro duce an
ef fect. We there fore de cide on the au thor ity of the Sruti that the en tire
world has sprung from the one Brah man, Akasa be ing pro duced first
and later on the other el e ments in due suc ces sion (Vide II.1.24).
It is not right to say that with ref er ence to the or i gin of Akasa we
could not find out any dif fer ence be tween its pre-causal state and its
post-causal state (the time be fore and af ter the orig i na tion of ether).
Brah man is de scribed as not gross and not sub tle ( _Asthulam na anu_ )
in the Sruti. The Sruti re fers to an Anakasa state, a state de void of
Akasa.
Brah man does not par tic i pate in the na ture of Akasa as we un -
der stand from the pas sage. “It is with out Akasa” (Bri. Up. III.8.8).
There fore it is a set tled con clu sion that, be fore Akasa was pro duced,
Brah man ex isted with out Akasa.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 244
```

More over, you (Purvapakshin or op po nent) are cer tainly wrong
in say ing that Akasa is dif fer ent in its na ture from earth, etc. The Sruti
is against the uncreatedness of Akasa. Hence there is no good in
such in fer ence.
The in fer ence drawn by you that Akasa has no be gin ning be -
cause it dif fers in na ture from these sub stances which have a be gin -
ning such as earth, etc., is with out any value, be cause it must be
con sid ered fal la cious as it is con tra dicted by the Sruti. We have
brought for ward co gent, con vinc ing and strong ar gu ments show ing
that Akasa is an orig i nated thing.
Akasa has Anitya-guna (non-eter nal at trib ute). There fore it also
is Anitya (non-eter nal). Akasa is non-eter nal be cause it is the sub stra -
tum of a non-eter nal qual ity, viz., sound, just as jars and other things,
which are the sub strata of non-eter nal qual i ties are them selves
non-eter nal. The Vedantin who takes his stand on the Upanishads
does not ad mit that the At man is the sub stra tum of non-eter nal qual i -
ties.
You can not say that At man also may be Anitya (non-eter nal) for
Sruti de clares that At man is eter nal (Nitya).
The Sruti texts which de scribe Akasa as eter nal (Am ri ta) de -
scribe it so in a sec ond ary sense only (Gauna), just as it calls
heaven-dwell ing gods as eter nal (Am ri ta). The or i gin and de struc tion
of Akasa has been shown to be pos si ble.
Even in the Sruti text, “ _Akasavat sarvagatascha nityah_ ” which
de scribes At man as sim i lar to Akasa in be ing all-per vad ing and eter -
nal, these words are used only in a sec ond ary and fig u ra tive sense
(Gauna).
The words are used only to in di cate in fi nite ness or super-em i -
nent great ness of At man and not to say that At man and Akasa are
equal. The use is as “when the sun is said to go like an ar row.” When
we say that the sun moves with the speed of an ar row, we sim ply
mean that he moves fast, not that he moves at the same rate as an ar -
row.
Such pas sages as “Brah man is greater or vaster than Akasa”
prove that the ex tent of Akasa is less than that of Brah man. Pas sages
like “There is no im age of Him. There is noth ing like Brah man— _Na
tasya pratimasti_ ” (Svet. Up. IV.19) show that there is noth ing to com -
pare Brah man to. Pas sages like “Ev ery thing else is of evil” (Bri. Up.
III.4.2) show that ev ery thing dif fer ent from Brah man such as Akasa is
of evil. All but Brah man is small. Hence Akasa is an ef fect of Brah -
man.
Srutis and rea son ing show that Akasa has an or i gin. There fore
the fi nal set tled con clu sion is that Akasa is an ef fect of Brah man.

Air originates from ether
```
**EVoZ _mV[aídm ì`m»`mV...Ÿ&**

**Etena matarisva vyakhyatah** II.3.8 (224)

By this i.e., the foregoing explanation about Akasa being a

product, (the fact of) air (also being an effect) is explained.

**Etena:** by this, i.e., the foregoing explanation about Akasa being a
production, by this parity of reasoning; **Matarisva:** the air, the mover
in mother, space; **Vyakhyatah:** is explained.

This Su tra states that air also, like Akasa, has been cre ated by
and from Brah man.
The pres ent Su tra ex tends the rea son ing con cern ing Akasa to
the air of which the Akasa is the abode. The Purvapakshin main tains
that the air is not a prod uct, be cause it is not men tioned in the chap ter
of the Chhandogya Upanishad which treats of the orig i na tion of
things. The Purvapakshin says that the birth of air men tioned in the
Taittiriya Upanishad is fig u ra tive only, be cause air is said to be one of
the im mor tal along with Akasa.
“Vayu (the air) is the de ity that never sets” (Bri. Up. I.5.22). The
de nial of Vayu’s never set ting re fers to the lower knowl edge or Apara
Vidya in which Brah man is spo ken of as to be med i tated upon un der
the form of Vayu and is merely a rel a tive one.
The glory of Vayu is re ferred to as an ob ject of wor ship. The
Sruti says “Vayu never sets.” Some dull type of men may think that
Vayu (air) is eter nal. To re move this doubt there is made a for mal ex -
ten sion of the for mer rea son ing to air also.
Vayu is called death less or im mor tal only in a fig u ra tive sense.
Vayu (air) also has or i gin like Akasa.

being an origin of Brahman.

This Su tra states that Brah man has no or i gin as it is, nei ther
proved by rea son ing nor di rectly stated by Sruti.
The word ‘tu’ (but) is used in or der to re move the doubt.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 246
```

```
The op po nent says that Svetasvatara Upanishad de clares that
```
Brah man is born, “Thou art born with Thy face turned to all di rec tions”

(Svet. Up. 4.3).
We can not, as in the case of Akasa and Vayu, at trib ute or i gin to
Brah man also. Brah man is not an ef fect like Akasa, etc. Orig i na tion of

Brah man can not be es tab lished by any method of proof.
Brah man is ex is tence it self. It can not be an ef fect, as It can have

no cause. The Sruti text ex pressly de nies that Brah man has any pro -

gen i tor. “He is the cause, the Lord of the Lords of the or gans and there

is of Him nei ther pro gen i tor nor Lord” (Svet. Up. VI.9).
More over it is not sep a rated from any thing else.
Nei ther can Sat come from Asat, as Asat has no be ing, for that

which is not (Asat) is with out a self and can not there fore con sti tute a

cause, be cause a cause is the self of its ef fects. The Sruti says “How

can ex is tence come out of non-ex is tence? (Chh. Up. VI.2.2).
You can not say that Sat co mes from Sat as the re la tion of cause

and ef fect can not ex ist with out a cer tain su pe ri or ity on the part of the

cause. The ef fect must have some spe ci al ity not pos sessed by the

cause. Brah man is mere ex is tence with out any de struc tion.
Brah man can not spring from that which is some thing par tic u lar,
as this would be con trary to ex pe ri ence. Be cause we ob serve that

par tic u lar forms are pro duced from what is gen eral, as for in stance,

jars and pots from clay, but not that which is gen eral is pro duced from

par tic u lars. Hence Brah man which is ex is tence in gen eral, can not be

the ef fect of any par tic u lar thing.
If there is no eter nal First Cause, the log i cal fal lacy of Anavastha

Dosha ( _regressus ad in fi ni tum_ ) is in ev i ta ble. The non-ad mis sion of a

fun da men tal cause (sub stance) would drive us to a _retrogressus ad_

_in fi ni tum_. Sruti says, “That great birthless Self is undecaying” (Bri. Up.

IV.4.25).
Brah man is with out any or i gin. Ac cord ing to Sruti, He alone is

the True one, who ex ists eter nally. On the sup po si tion of the or i gin of
Brah man, He can not be said to be eter nal. Hence such a sup po si tion

is against Sruti. It is also against rea son ing, be cause by ad mit ting

such an or i gin the ques tion of source of that or i gin arises; then again

an other source of that source and so on. Thus an ar gu ment may be

con tin ued _ad in fi ni tum_ with out com ing to a def i nite con clu sion.
That fun da men tal cause—sub stance—which is gen er ally ac -

knowl edged to ex ist, just that is our Brah man.
There fore Brah man is not an ef fect but is eter nal.

Tejo’dhikaranam: Topic 4
Fire originates from air
```
**VoOmo@V... VWm ømhŸ&**

**Tejo’tah tatha hyaha** II.3.10 (226)

Fire (is produced) from this (i.e., air), so verily (declares the

Sruti).

**Tejah:** fire; **Atah:** from this, namely from air which has been just

spoken of in Sutra 8; **Tatha:** thus, so; **Hi:** because, verily; **Aha:** says

(Sruti).

Taittiriya Upanishad de clares that fire was born of air
“ _Vayoragnih_ —From air is pro duced fire” (Tait. Up. II.1). Chhandogya
Upanishad (IV.2.3) de clares “That (Brah man) cre ated fire”.
The con sis tency of the two Srutis is shown in Su tra 13.
There is thus a con flict of scrip tural pas sages with re gard to the
or i gin of fire. The Purvapakshin main tains that fire has Brah man for its
source. Why? Be cause the text de clares in the be gin ning that there
ex isted only that which is. It sent forth fire. The as ser tion that ev ery -
thing can be known through Brah man is pos si ble only if ev ery thing is
pro duced from Brah man. The scrip tural state ment “ _Tajjalan_ ” (Chh.
Up. III.14.1) spec i fies no dif fer ence. The Mundaka text (II.1.3) de -
clares that ev ery thing with out ex cep tion is born from Brah man. The
Taittiriya Upanishad speaks about the en tire uni verse with out any ex -
cep tion “Af ter hav ing brooded, sent forth all what ever there is” (Tait.
Up. II.6). There fore, the state ment that ‘Fire was pro duced from air’
(Tait. Up. II.1) teaches the or der of suc ces sion only. “Fire was pro -
duced sub se quently to air.”
The Purvapakshin says: The above two Upanishadic pas sages
can be rec on ciled by in ter pret ing the Taittiriya text to mean the or der
of se quence—Brah man af ter cre at ing air, cre ated fire.
This Su tra re futes this and says that Fire is pro duced from Vayu
or air. This does not at all con tra dict the Chhandogya text. It means
that Air is a prod uct of Brah man and that fire is pro duced from Brah -
man, which has as sumed the form of air. Fire sprang from Brah man
only through in ter me di ate links, not di rectly. We may say equally that
milk co mes from the cow, that curds come from the cow, that cheese
co mes from the cow.
The gen eral as ser tion that ev ery thing springs from Brah man re -
quires that all things should ul ti mately be traced to that cause, and not
that they should be its im me di ate ef fects. Thus there is no con tra dic -
tion. There re mains no dif fi culty.
It is not right to say that Brah man di rectly cre ated Fire af ter cre -
at ing Air, be cause the Taittiriya ex pressly says that fire was born of
Air. No doubt Brah man is the root cause.

Water is produced from fire
```
**Amn...Ÿ&**

**Apah** lI.3. 1 1 (227)

Water (is produced from fire).

**Apah:** water.

( **Atah:** from it; **Tatha:** thus; **Hi:** because; **Aha:** says the Sruti.)

The same thing may be said of wa ter.
We have to sup ply from the pre ced ing Su tra the words “thence”
and “for thus the text de clares”.
The au thor of the Sutras ex plained the cre ation of fire in the pre -

vi ous Su tra. He ex plains cre ation of earth in the next Su tra. He pro -
pounds the Su tra in or der to in sert wa ter and thus to point out its

po si tion in the Srishtikrama or or der of cre ation.
_“Agnerapah”_ —From fire sprang wa ter (Tait. Up. II.1). _“Tatteja
aikshata bahu syam prajayeyeti tadapo’srijata_ —The fire thought ‘May

I be many, may I grow forth.’ It cre ated wa ter.” (Chh. Up. VI.2.3).
_Doubt:_ Does wa ter come out di rectly from fire or from Brah man?
The Purvapakshin says: Wa ter co mes out di rectly from Brah -
man as the Chhandyoga text teaches.
_Siddhanta:_ There is no such con flict. From fire is pro duced wa -
ter, for thus says the scrip ture.
Here also it means that as fire is a prod uct of Brah man, it is from

Brah man which has as sumed the form of fire, that wa ter is pro duced.
There is no room for in ter pre ta tion re gard ing a text which is ex press

and un am big u ous.
In the Chhandogya Upanishad is given the rea son why wa ter
co mes out of fire. “And, there fore, when ever any body any where is hot
and per spires wa ter is pro duced on him from fire alone. Sim i larly,

when a man suf fers grief and is hot with sor row, he weeps and thus
wa ter is also pro duced from fire.”
These ex plicit state ments leave no doubt that wa ter is cre ated

from fire.

The earth (is meant by the word ‘Anna’) because of the subject

CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 249
```

**Prithivi:** earth; **Adhikara:** because of the context, because of the

subject matter; **Rupa:** colour; **Sabdantarebhyah:** on account of

other texts (Sruti).

The same thing may be said of earth.
“From wa ter sprang earth” (Tait. Up. II.1). “It (wa ter) pro duced
Anna (lit er ally food)” (Chh. Up. VI.2.4). The two Sruti texts are ap par -
ently con tra dic tory, be cause in one text wa ter is said to pro duce earth
and in an other food.
The Su tra says that ‘Anna’ in the Chhandogya text means not
food but earth. Why? On ac count of the sub ject mat ter, on ac count of
the col our, and on ac count of other pas sages. The sub ject mat ter in
the first place is clearly con nected with the el e ments, as we see from
the pre ced ing pas sages. “It sent forth fire; it sent forth wa ter.” In de -
scrib ing the cre ative or der we can not jump from wa ter to ce re als with -
out hav ing the earth. The cre ative or der re ferred to is in re gard to the
el e ments. There fore ‘Anna’ should re fer to an el e ment and not food.
Again we find in a com ple men tary pas sage, “The black col our in
fire is the col our of Anna” (Chh. Up. VI.4.1). Here, the ref er ence to col -
our ex pressly in di cates that the earth is meant by ‘Anna’. Black col our
agrees with earth. The pre dom i nant col our of earth is black. Eat able
things such as cooked dishes, rice, bar ley and the like are not nec es -
sar ily black. The Pauranikas also des ig nate the col our of the earth by
the term ‘night’. The night is black. We, there fore, con clude that black
is the col our of earth, also.
Other Sruti texts like “What was there as the froth of the wa ter,
that was hard ened and be came the earth” (Bri. Up. I.2.2), clearly in di -
cate that from wa ter earth is pro duced.
On the other hand the text de clares that rice and the like were
pro duced from the earth, “From earth sprang herbs, from herbs food”
(Tait. Up. II.1.2).
The com ple men tary pas sage also, “when ever it rains” etc.,
point ing out that ow ing to the earthly na ture of food (rice, bar ley, etc.),
earth it self im me di ately springs from wa ter.
There fore, for all these rea sons the word ‘Anna’ de notes this
earth. There is re ally no con tra dic tion be tween the Chhandogya and
Taittiriya texts.

**Tat** (Tasya): His (of Brahman); **Abhidhyanat:** because of the volition,
reflection; **Eva:** even, only; **Tu:** but; **Tat lingat:** because of His

indicating marks; **Sah:** He.

The con ten tion raised in Su tra 10 is now re futed.
The word ‘tu’ (but) is used in or der to re move the doubt.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor says: The Srutis de clare that
Brah man is the cre ator of ev ery thing. But the Taittiriya Upanishad
says “From Akasa sprang air” (Tait. Up. II.1). This in di cates that cer -
tain el e ments pro duce cer tain ef fects in de pend ently. There is con tra -
dic tion in the Sruti pas sages. This Su tra re futes this ob jec tion.
Cre ation of Akasa, fire, wind, wa ter is done solely to God’s will.
One el e ment can not cre ate an other el e ment out of its own power. It is
God in the form of one el e ment that cre ates an other el e ment there -
from by His will.
The el e ments are in ert. They have no power to cre ate. Brah man
Him self act ing from within the el e ments was the real cre ator of all
those el e ments. You will find in Brihadaranyka Upanishad “He who
dwells within the fire, who is dif fer ent from fire, whom fire does not
know, whose body is fire, who rules the fire from within, is Thy Im mor -
tal At man, the In ner Ruler within” (Bri. Up. III.7.5).
This Sruti text in di cates that the Su preme Lord is the sole Ruler
and de nies all in de pend ence to the el e ments.
Though it is stated in the Chhandogya Upanishad that the el e -
ments have cre ated each one, the other next of it, yet the Su preme
Lord is in deed the cre ator of ev ery thing be cause Sruti de clares that
Brah man has cre ated this world by the ex er cise of His will.
Texts such as “He wished may I be come many, may I grow forth”
(Tait. Up. II.6) and “It made it self its Self,” i.e., the Self of ev ery thing
which ex ists (II.7)—in di cates that the Su preme Lord is the Self of ev -
ery thing. The pas sage “There is no other seer (thinker) but He” de -
nies there be ing any other seer (thinker), that which is (i.e., Brah man)
in the char ac ter of seer or thinker con sti tutes the sub ject mat ter of the
whole Chap ter, as we con clude from the in tro duc tory pas sage “It
thought, may I be many, may I grow forth” (Chh. Up. VI.2.3).
In the Chhandogya Upanishad it is stated “That fire thought.
That wa ter thought.” Re flec tion is not pos si ble for the in ert el e ments.
The Su preme Lord, the In ner Ruler of all el e ments, the Indweller
within the el e ments re flected and pro duced the ef fects. This is the
real mean ing. The el e ments be came causes only through the agency
of the Su preme Lord who abides within them and rules them from
within. There fore there is no con tra dic tion at all be tween the two texts.

Viparyayadhikaranam: Topic 8
The process of dissolution of the elements is
in the reverse order from that of creation
```
**{dn`©`oU Vw H«$_mo@V... CnnÚVo MŸ&**

**Viparyayena tu kramo’tah upapadyate cha** II.3.14 (230)

The order (in which the elements are indeed withdrawn into
Brahman during Pralaya or dissolution) is the reverse of that
(i.e., the order in which they are created) and this is
reasonable.

**Viparyayena:** in the reverse order; **Tu:** indeed, but; **Kramah:** order,
the process of dissolution; **Atah:** from that (the order of creation);
**Cha:** and; **Upapadyate:** is reasonable.

The pro cess of dis so lu tion of the el e ments is de scribed in this
Su tra.
The word ‘tu’ (but) has the force of ‘only’ here. The ques tion here
is whether at the time of cos mic dis so lu tion or Pralaya the el e ments
are with drawn into Brah man in an in def i nite or der, or in the or der of
cre ation or in the re verse or der.
In cre ation the or der is from above and in dis so lu tion the or der is
from be low. The or der of in vo lu tion is in the in verse of the or der of
evo lu tion. It alone is quite ap pro pri ate and rea son able. Be cause we
see in or di nary life that a man who has as cended a stair has in de -
scend ing to take the steps in the re verse or der.
Fur ther, we ob serve that things made of clay such as jars,
dishes, etc., on be ing de stroyed pass back into clay and that things
which have orig i nated from wa ter such as snow and hail-stones again
dis solve into wa ter, the cause.
The gross be comes re solved into the sub tle, the sub tle into the
sub tler and so on till the whole man i fes ta tion at tains its fi nal First
Cause, viz., Brah man. Each el e ment is with drawn into its im me di ate
cause, in the re verse or der till Akasa is reached, which in turn gets
merged in Brah man.
Smriti also de clares “O Di vine Rishi! the earth, the ba sis of the
uni verse is dis solved into wa ter, wa ter into fire, fire into air.”
Those which are pro duced first in cre ation are more pow er ful.
Con se quently they have lon ger ex is tence. There fore, it fol lows log i -
cally that the lat est in cre ation, be ing of fee ble es sence, should first
be come ab sorbed in those of higher pow ers. The higher pow ers

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 252

should later on take their turn. Vamana Purana de clares: “The ear lier
a thing hap pens to be in cre ation, the more it be comes the re cep ta cle
of the Lord’s glory. Con se quently those that are ear lier in cre ation are
more pow er ful and are with drawn only later. And for the same rea son
un doubt edly their per va sion is also greater.”

The mention of the mind and intellect does not interfere

**Antara vijnanamanasi kramena tallingaditi

If it be said that between (Brahman and the elements) the
intellect and the mind (are mentioned, and that therefore their
origination and re-absorption are to be placed) somewhere in
the series on account of their being inferential signs (whereby
the order of the creation of the elements is broken), we say, not
so on account of the non-difference (of the intellect and the
mind from the elements).

**Antara:** intervening between, in between; **Vijnanamanasi:** the
intellect and the mind; **Kramena:** in the order of succession,
according to the successive order; **Tat lingat:** owing to indication of
that, as there is indication in Sruti to that effect, because of an
inferential mark of this; **Iti:** thus, this; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not, no, not so, the
objection cannot stand; **Aviseshat:** because of no speciality, as there
is no speciality mentioned in Sruti about the causation of the
elements, because there being no particular difference, on account of
non-difference.

A fur ther ob jec tion to the cau sa tion of the pri mary el e ments from
Brah man is raised and re futed.
The Su tra con sists of two parts namely an ob jec tion and its ref u -
ta tion. The ob jec tion is “ _Antara vijnanamanasi kramena tallingat iti
chet_ ”. The ref u ta tion por tion is “ _Na aviseshat_ ”.
In the Atharvana (Mundaka Upanishad) in the chap ter which
treats of the cre ation oc curs the fol low ing text: “From this (Brah man)
are born Prana, mind, the senses, ether, air, fire, wa ter and earth, the
sup port of all” (II.1.3).
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: The or der of cre ation
which is de scribed in the Mundaka Upanishad con tra dicts the or der of
cre ation of el e ments de scribed in the Chhandogya Upanishad VI.2.3,
and other Srutis.
To this we re ply: This is only a se rial enu mer a tion of the or gans
and the el e ments. It is not cer tainly a state ment as to the or der of their

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 253
```

orig i na tion. The Mundaka text only states that all these are pro duced
from Brah man.
In the Atharva Veda (Mundaka) mind, in tel lect and the senses
are men tioned in the mid dle of the enu mer a tion of the el e ments. This
does not af fect the evo lu tion ary or der, be cause the mind, the in tel lect
and the senses are the ef fects, of the el e ments and their in vo lu tion is
in cluded in the in vo lu tion of the el e ments.
The in tel lect, the mind and the senses are prod ucts of the el e -
ments. There fore, they can come into be ing only af ter the el e ments
are cre ated. The orig i na tion and re ab sorp tion of the mind, in tel lect
and the senses are the same as those of the el e ments as there is no
dif fer ence be tween the senses and the el e ments.
Even if the mind, the in tel lect and the senses are sep a rate from
the el e ments, the evo lu tion ary or der is ei ther the mind and the senses
fol lowed by the el e ments or the el e ments fol lowed by the mind and
the senses. Any how they have an or derly evo lu tion.
That the mind, in tel lect and the or gans are mod i fi ca tions of the
el e ments and are of the na ture of the el e ments is proved by Sruti texts
like “For the mind, my child, con sists of earth, breath or vi tal force of
wa ter, speech of fire” (Chh. Up. VI.6.5).
Hence the Mundaka text which treats of cre ation does not con -
tra dict the or der of cre ation men tioned in the Chhandogya and
Taittiriya Upanishads. The orig i na tion of the or gans does not cause a
break in the or der of the orig i na tion of the el e ments.
The Purvapakshin again says: that as there is men tion in Sruti of
the mind and the senses, Akasa and the other el e ments should not be
con sid ered to be cre ated out of Brah man and to dis solve in Brah man
but to be cre ated out of and to dis solve in the mind and the senses ac -
cord ing to the or der of suc ces sion, as there is in di ca tion in the
Mundaka to that ef fect.
This ar gu ment is un ten a ble as there is no spe ci al ity men tioned
in Sruti about the cre ation of the el e ments. The mind, the in tel lect and
the senses have all with out ex cep tion been stated therein as cre ated
out of Brah man.
The word ‘Etasmat’ of that text is to be read along with ev ery one
of these i.e., Prana, mind, etc. Thus “from Him is born Prana, from
Him is born mind, from Him are born the senses etc.— _Etasmat
Pranah, Etasmat Manah_ ”, etc.

Births and deaths are not of the soul

**Characharavyapasrayastu syat tadvyapadeso bhaktah

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 254
```

But the mention of that (viz., birth and death of the individual

soul) is apt only with reference to the bodies of beings moving

and non-moving. It is secondary or metaphorical if applied to
the soul, as the existence of those terms depends on the

existence of that (i.e., the body).

**Characharavyapasrayah:** in connection with the bodies fixed and
movable; **Tu:** but, indeed; **Syat:** may be, becomes; **Tadvyapadesah:**
mention of that, that expression, i.e., to popular expressions of births
and deaths of the soul; **Bhaktah:** secondary, metaphorical, not literal;
**Tadbhavabhavitvat:** on account of (those terms) depending on the
existence of that. ( **Tadbhava:** on the existence of that, i.e., the body;
**Bhavitvat:** depending.)

The es sen tial na ture or char ac ter of the in di vid ual soul is dis -
cussed now.
A doubt may arise that the in di vid ual soul also has births and
deaths be cause peo ple use such ex pres sions as “Ramakrishna is
born”, “Ramakrishna is dead” and be cause cer tain cer e mo nies such
as the Jatakarma etc., are pre scribed by the scrip tures at the birth
and death of peo ple.
This Su tra re futes such a doubt, and de clares that the in di vid ual
soul has nei ther birth nor death. Birth and death per tain to the body
with which the soul is con nected but not to the soul. If the in di vid ual
soul per ishes there would be no sense in the re li gious in junc tions and
pro hi bi tions re fer ring to the en joy ment and avoid ance of pleas ant and
un pleas ant things in an other body (an other birth).
The con nec tion of the body with the soul is pop u larly called
birth, and the dis con nec tion of the soul from the body is called death
in the com mon par lance. Scrip ture says, “This body in deed dies when
the liv ing soul has left it, the liv ing soul does not die” (Chh. Up.
VI. 1 1.3). Hence birth and death are spo ken pri mar ily of the bod ies of
mov ing and non-mov ing be ings and only met a phor i cally of the soul.
That the words ‘birth’ and ‘death’ have ref er ence to the con junc -
tion with and sep a ra tion from a body merely is also shown by the fol -
low ing Sruti text, “On be ing born that per son as sum ing his body,
when he passes out of the body and dies” etc. (Bri. Up. IV.3.8).
The Jatakarma cer e mony also has ref er ence to the man i fes ta -
tion of the body only be cause the soul is not man i fested.
Hence the birth and death be long to the body only but not to the
soul.

**Natma, asruternityatvat cha tabhyah** II.3.17 (233)

CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 255
```

The individual soul is not (produced), (because) it is not (so)

mentioned by the scriptures, and as it is eternal according to

them (the Sruti texts).

**Na:** not (produced); **Atma:** the individual soul; **Asruteh:** because of

no mention in Sruti, as it is not found in Sruti; **Nityatvat:** because of its

permanence, as it is eternal; **Cha:** also, and; **Tabhyah:** from them

(Srutis), according to the Srutis.

The dis cus sion on the es sen tial char ac ter is tics of the in di vid ual
soul is be ing con tin ued.
Aitareya Upanishad de clares: At the be gin ning of cre ation there
was only “One Brah man with out a sec ond” (I.1). There fore it is not
rea son able to say that the in di vid ual soul is not born, be cause then
there was noth ing but Brah man.
Again the Sruti says, “As small sparks come forth from fire, thus
from that At man all Pranas, all worlds, all gods em a nate” (Bri. Up.
II.1.20). “As from a blaz ing fire sparks, be ing of the same na ture as
fire, fly forth a thousandfold, thus are var i ous be ings brought forth
from the Im per ish able, my friend, and re turn thither also,” (Mun. Up.
II.1.1). There fore the Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor ar gues that the in -
di vid ual soul is born at the be gin ning of the cy cle, just as Akasa and
other el e ments are born.
This Su tra re futes it and says that the in di vid ual soul is not born.
Why? on ac count of the ab sence of scrip tural state ment. For in the
chap ters which treat of the cre ation the Sruti texts ex pressly deny
birth to the in di vid ual soul.
We know from scrip tural pas sages that the soul is eter nal, that it
has no or i gin, that it is un chang ing, that what con sti tutes the soul is
the un mod i fied Brah man, and that the soul has its self rooted in Brah -
man. A be ing of such a na ture can not be pro duced.
The scrip tural pas sages to which we are al lud ing are the fol low -
ing: “The great un born Self undecaying, un dy ing, im mor tal, fear less is
in deed Brah man” (Bri. Up. IV.4.25). “The know ing self is not born, it
dies not” (Katha Up. I.2.18). “The an cient is un born, eter nal, ev er last -
ing” (Katha Up. I.2.18).
It is the one Brah man with out a sec ond that en ters the in tel lect
and ap pears as the in di vid ual soul “Hav ing sent forth that en tered into
it” (Tait. Up. II.6). “Let me now en ter those with this liv ing self and let
me then evolve names and forms” (Chh. Up. VI.3.2). “He en tered
thither to the very tips of fin ger-nails” (Bri. Up. I.4.7).
“Thou art That” (Chh. Up. VI.8.7). “I am Brah man” (Bri. Up.
I.4.10). “This self is Brah man, know ing all” (Bri. Up. II.5.19). All these
texts de clare the eter nity of the soul and thus con tend against the
view of its hav ing been pro duced.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 256
```

There fore there is in re al ity no dif fer ence be tween the in di vid ual
soul and Brah man. Jiva is not cre ated. It is not a prod uct. It is not born
just as Akasa and other el e ments are born. The fact of the in di vid ual
soul’s be ing non-cre ated does not con tra dict the Sruti pas sage “At
the be gin ning there was only the At man the one with out a sec ond”
(Ait. Up. I.1).
The men tion of cre ation of souls in the other Sruti pas sages
cited is only in a sec ond ary sense. It does not there fore con tra dict the
Sruti pas sage “Hav ing cre ated it, It en tered into it.”
The doc trine that souls are born from Brah man is not cor rect.
Those who pro pound this doc trine de clare that if souls are born from
Brah man, the scrip tural state ment that by know ing Brah man ev ery -
thing can be come true, be cause Brah man is the cause and the
knowl edge of the cause will lead to the knowl edge of all the ob jects.
They say fur ther that Brah man can not be iden ti fied with the in di vid ual
souls, be cause He is sin less and pure, whereas they are not so. They
fur ther say that all that is sep a rate is an ef fect and that as the souls
are sep a rate they must be ef fects.
The souls are not sep a rate. The Sruti de clares, “There is one
God hid den in all be ings, all-per vad ing, the Self within all be ings”
(Svet. Up. VI. 1 1). It only ap pears di vided ow ing to its lim it ing ad juncts,
such as the mind and so on, just as the ether ap pears di vided by its
con nec tion with jars and the like. It is His con nec tion with the in tel lect
that leads to his be ing called a Jiva, or the in di vid ual soul. Ether in a
pot is iden ti cal with the ether in space. All the above ob jec tions can not
stand be cause of the ac tual iden tity of the in di vid ual soul and Brah -
man. There fore there is no con tra dic tion of the dec la ra tion of the Sruti
that by know ing Brah man we can know ev ery thing. Orig i na tion of
souls has ref er ence only to the body.

The nature of the individual soul is intelligence

For this very reason (viz., that it is not created), (the individual

**Jnah:** intelligent, intelligence, knower; **Ata eva:** for this very reason,
therefore.

The dis cus sion on the es sen tial char ac ter is tics of the in di vid ual

The Sankhya doc trine is that the soul is al ways Chaitanya or
pure con scious ness in its own na ture.

```

sleep or swoon. It be comes in tel li gent when the soul co mes to the
wak ing state and unites with the mind. The in tel li gence of the soul is
ad ven ti tious and is pro duced by the con junc tion of the soul with the
mind, just as for in stance the qual ity of red ness is pro duced in an iron
rod by the con junc tion of the iron rod with fire.
If the soul were eter nal, es sen tial in tel li gence, it would re main
in tel li gent in the states of deep sleep, swoon etc. Those who wake up
from sleep say that they were not con scious of any thing. There fore,
as in tel li gence is clearly in ter mit tent, we con clude that the in tel li gence
of the soul is ad ven ti tious only.
To this we re ply that the soul is of eter nal in tel li gence. In tel li -
gence con sti tutes the es sen tial na ture of Brah man. This we know
from Sruti texts such as “Brah man is knowl edge and Bliss” (Bri. Up.
III.9.28.7). “Brah man is true, knowl edge, in fi nite” (Tait. Up. II.1). “Hav -
ing nei ther in side nor out side but be ing al to gether a mass of knowl -
edge” (Bri. Up. IV.5.13). Now if the in di vid ual soul is noth ing but that
Su preme Brah man, then eter nal in tel li gence con sti tutes the soul’s
es sen tial na ture, just as light and heat con sti tute the na ture of fire.
The in tel li gent Brah man It self be ing lim ited by the Upadhis or
lim it ing ad juncts such as body, mind etc., man i fests as the in di vid ual
soul or Jiva. There fore, in tel li gence is the very na ture of Jiva and is
never al to gether de stroyed, nor even in the state of deep sleep or
swoon.
Sruti texts di rectly de clare that the in di vid ual soul is of the na ture
of self-lu mi nous in tel li gence. “He not asleep, him self looks down
upon the sleep ing senses” (Bri. Up. IV.3.11). “That per son is self-il lu -
mi nated” (Bri. Up. IV.3.14). “For there is no in ter mis sion of the know -
ing of the knower” (Bri. Up. IV.3.30).
That the soul’s na ture is in tel li gence fol lows more over from the
pas sage (Chh. Up. VIII.12.4) where it is stated as con nected with
knowl edge through all sense or gans. “He who knows let me smell
this, he is the self.”
You may ask, what is the use of the senses if the At man it self is
of the na ture of knowl edge. The senses are needed to bring about the
dif fer en ti ated sen sa tions and ideas (Vrittijnana).
From the soul’s es sen tial na ture be ing in tel li gence it does not
fol low that the senses are use less; be cause they serve the pur pose of
de ter min ing the spe cial ob ject of each sense, such as smell and so
on. Sruti ex pressly de clares: “Smell (or gan of smell) is for the pur pose
of per ceiv ing odour” (Chh. Up. VIII.12.4).
The ob jec tion that sleep ing per sons are not con scious of any -
thing is re futed by scrip ture, where we read con cern ing a man ly ing in
deep sleep, “And when there he does not see, yet he is see ing though
he does not see. Be cause there is no in ter mis sion of the see ing of the

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 258
```

seer for it can not per ish. But there is then no sec ond, noth ing else dif -
fer ent from him that he could see” (Bri. Up. IV.3.23).
The non-sentiency in deep sleep is not due to ab sence of
Chaitanya but ab sence of Vishaya (ob jects). The Jiva does not lose
its power of see ing. It does not see, be cause there is no ob ject to see.
It has not lost its in tel li gence, for it is im pos si ble. The ab sence of ac -
tual in tel lec tual ity is due to the ab sence of ob jects, but not to the ab -
sence of in tel li gence, just as the light per vad ing space is not ap par ent
ow ing to the ab sence of things to be il lu mi nated, not to the ab sence of
its own na ture.
If in tel li gence did not ex ist in deep sleep, etc., then who would
be there to say that it did not ex ist? How could it be known? The man
af ter wak ing from deep sleep says, “I slept soundly. I en joyed per fect
rest. I did not know any thing.” He who says, “I did not know any thing. I
en joyed per fect rest” must have been ex is tent at that time. If it is not
so how could he re mem ber the con di tion of that state?
There fore, the in tel li gence of the in di vid ual soul or Jiva is never
lost un der any con di tion. The rea son ing of the Vaiseshikas and oth ers
is merely fal la cious. It con tra dicts the Srutis. We there fore con clude
and de cide that eter nal in tel li gence is the es sen tial na ture of the soul.

The size of the individual soul

**CËH«$mpÝVJË`mJVrZm_² Ÿ&**

**Utkrantigatyagatinam** II.3.19 (235)
(On account of the scriptural declarations) of (the soul’s)
passing out, going, and returning (the soul is not infinite in
size; it is of atomic size).

**Utkranti:** passing out, coming out; **Gati:** going; **Agatinam:** returning.

The dis cus sion on the char ac ter of the in di vid ual soul is con tin -
ued.
From this up to Su tra 32 the ques tion of the size of the soul,
whether it is atomic, me dium-sized or in fi nite is dis cussed. The first
ten Sutras (19-28) state the ar gu ments for the view that the in di vid ual
soul is Anu (atomic). The next four Sutras give the re ply.
Svetasvatara Upanishad de clares “He is the one God, all-per -
vad ing” (VI.11). Mundaka Sruti says, “This At man is atomic” (III.1.9).
The two texts con tra dict each other and we have to ar rive at a de ci -
sion on the point.
It has been shown above that the soul is not a prod uct and that
eter nal in tel li gence con sti tutes its na ture. There fore it fol lows that it is
iden ti cal with the Su preme Brah man. The in fin ity of the Su preme
Brah man is ex pressly de clared in the Srutis. What need then is there
of a dis cus sion of the size of the soul? True, we re ply. But Sruti texts

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 259
```

which speak of the soul’s pass ing out from the body (Utkranti), go ing
(Gati) and re turn ing (Agati), es tab lish the _prima fa cie_ view that the
soul is of lim ited size. Fur ther, the Sruti clearly de clares in some
places that the soul is of atomic size. The pres ent dis cus sion is there -
fore be gun in or der to clear this doubt.
The op po nent or Purvapakshin holds that the soul must be of
lim ited atomic size ow ing to its be ing said to pass out, go and re turn.
Its pass ing out is men tioned in Kaushitaki Upanishad (III.3), “And
when he passes out of this body he passes out to gether with all
these.” Its go ing is said in Kaushitaki Upanishad (I.2), “All who de part
from this world go to the moon.” Its re turn ing is seen in
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (IV.4.6), “From that world he re turns
again to this world of ac tion.” From these state ments as to the soul’s
pass ing out from the body, go ing to heaven, etc., and re turn ing from
there to this world, it fol lows that it is of lim ited size. Be cause mo tion is
not pos si ble in the case of an all-per vad ing be ing. If the soul is in fi nite,
how can it rise, or go or come? There fore the soul is atomic.

**ñdmË_Zm MmoÎma`mo...Ÿ&**

**Svatmana chottarayoh** II.3.20 (236)

And on account of the latter two (i.e., going and returning)
being connected with their soul (i.e., agent), (the soul is of
atomic size).

**Svatmana:** (being connected) directly with the agent, the soul; **Cha:**
and, only, also; **Uttarayoh:** of the latter two, namely, of Gati and Agati,
of the going away and coming back, as stated in the previous Sutra.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 19 is given in this Su tra.
Even if it can be said that ‘pass ing out’ means only dis con nec -
tion with the body, how can they who say that the soul is in fi nite ex -
plain its go ing to the moon or re turn ing from there?
Even if the soul is in fi nite still it can be spo ken of as pass ing out,
out of the body, if by that term is meant ceas ing to be the ruler of the
body, in con se quence of the re sults of its for mer ac tions hav ing be -
come ex hausted, just as some body, when ceas ing to be the ruler of a
vil lage may be said to ‘go out’. The pass ing away from the body may
mean only ces sa tion of the ex er cise of a def i nite func tion just as in the
case of a man no lon ger re tained in of fice.
But the two lat ter ac tiv i ties viz., go ing to the moon, re turn ing
from there to the world, are im pos si ble for an all-per vad ing soul.
Hence the soul is atomic in size.

**Nanuratacchruteriti chet, na, itaradhikarat** II.3.21 (237)
If it be said that (the soul is) not atomic, as the scriptures state
it to be otherwise, (i.e., all-pervading), (we say) not so, because

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 260

(the one) other than the individual soul (i.e., the Supreme

Brahman or the Highest Self) is the subject matter (of those

passages).

**Na:** not; **Anu:** minute, atomic; **Atat:** not that, otherwise, namely
opposite of Anu; **Sruteh:** as it is stated in Sruti, because of a Sruti or
scriptural text; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not; **Itara:** other than the
individual soul, i.e., the Supreme Self; **Adhikarat:** because of the
context or topic, from the subject matter of the portion in the Chapter.

An ob jec tion to Su tra 19 is raised and re futed.
The Su tra con sists of an ob jec tion and its an swer. The ob jec -

“ _Na itaradhikarat_ .”
The pas sages which de scribe the soul and in fi nite ap ply only to
Su preme Brah man and not to the in di vid ual soul.
Sruti pas sages like “He is the one God, who is hid den in all be -
ings, all-per vad ing, etc.” (Svet. Up. VI. 1 1), “He is that great un born
Self who con sists of knowl edge, is sur rounded by the Pranas, the
ether within the heart.” (Bri. Up. IV.4.22), “Like the ether He is Om ni -
pres ent, eter nal,” “Truth, Knowl edge, In fi nite is Brah man” (Tait. Up.
II.1)—re fer not to the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul with its lim i ta tions, but
to the Su preme Brah man or the High est Self, who is other than the in -
di vid ual soul, and forms the chief sub ject mat ter of all the Vedanta
texts, be cause Brah man is the one thing that is to be known or real -

**Svasabdonmanabhyam cha** II.3.22 (238)
And on account of direct statements (of the Sruti texts as to the

atomic size) and infinitesimal measure (the soul is atomic).

**Svasabdonmanabhyam:** from direct statements (of Sruti texts) and
infinitesimal measure; **Cha:** and. ( **Svasabda:** the word itself; the
word directly denoting ‘minute’; **Unmanabhyam:** on account of the
measure of comparison; **Ut:** subtle; **Mana:** measure, hence subtle
division; hence smaller even than the small.
**Svasabdonmanabhyam:** as these are the words directly denoting
‘minute’ and to expression denoting smaller than the small as
measured by division.)

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 19 is con tin ued.
The soul must be atomic be cause the Sruti ex pressly says so
and calls him in fi nitely small.
Mundaka Sruti de clares, “This Atma is atomic” (III.1.9).
Svetasvatara Upanishad says, “The in di vid ual is of the size of the
hun dredth part of a part, which it self is one hun dredth part of the point

of a hair” (V.9); “That lower one also is seen small even like the point
of a goad.”
There fore the soul is atomic in size.
But an ob jec tion may here be raised. If the soul is of atomic size,
it will oc cupy a point of the body only. Then the sen sa tion which ex -
tends over the whole body would ap pear con trary to rea son. And yet it
is a mat ter of ex pe ri ence that those who take bath in the Gan ga ex pe -
ri ence the sen sa tion of cold all over their whole bod ies. In sum mer
peo ple feel hot all over the body. The fol low ing Su tra gives a suit able
an swer to the ob jec tion.

**Avirodhaschandanavat** II.3.23 (239)
There is no contradiction as in the case of sandal paste.

**Avirodhah:** non-conflict, no contradiction, no incongruity, it is not
incongruous; **Chandanavat:** like the sandal paste.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 19 is con tin ued.
Just as one drop of san dal-wood paste, smeared on one part of
the body makes the whole body thrill with joy, so also the in di vid ual
soul, though nat u rally min ute, man i fests it self through out the whole
body and ex pe ri ences all the sen sa tions of plea sure and pain.
Though the soul is atomic it may ex pe ri ence plea sure and pain ex -
tend ing over the whole body. Though the soul is atomic still it is pos si -
ble that it per vades the en tire body, just as a drop of san dal paste
al though in ac tual con tact with one par tic u lar spot of the body only
per vades, i.e., causes re fresh ing sen sa tion all over the body.
As the soul is con nected with the skin which is the seat of feel -
ing, the as sump tion that the soul’s sen sa tions should ex tend over the
whole body is not con trary to rea son be cause the con nec tion of the
soul and the skin abides in the en tire skin and the skin ex tends over
the en tire body.

the specialisation of abode (present in the case of the
sandal-ointment, absent in the case of the soul), we deny that,
on account of the acknowledgement (by scripture, of a special
place of the soul), viz., within the heart.

**Avasthiti:** existence, residence, abode; **Vaiseshyat:** because of the
speciality, on account of specialisation; **Iti:** thus, this; **Chet:** if (if it be
argued); **Na:** not (so), no, the argument cannot stand;
**Adhyupagamat:** on account of the admission, or acknowledgment;

BRAHMA SUTRAS 262

An ob jec tion to Su tra 23 is raised and re futed by the op po nent or
Purvapakshin.
The Su tra con sists of two parts namely, an ob jec tion, and its re -
ply. The ob jec tion-por tion is: ‘ _Avasthitivaiseshyaditi chet_ ’, and the re -
ply por tion is: _‘Nabhyupagamaddhridi hi’_.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor raises an ob jec tion against
his own view. The ar gu men ta tion re lied upon in the last Su tra is not
ad mis si ble, be cause the two cases com pared are not par al lel. The
sim i lar ity is not ex act. The anal ogy is faulty or in ap pro pri ate. In the
case of the san dal paste, it oc cu pies a par tic u lar point of the body and
re freshes the en tire body. But in the case of the soul it does not ex ist
in any par tic u lar lo cal ity but is per cip i ent of all sen sa tions through out
the en tire body. We do not know that it has a par tic u lar abode or spe -
cial seat. When there is no spe cial seat, for the soul, we can not in fer
that it must have a par tic u lar abode in the body like the san dal paste
and there fore be atomic. Be cause, even an all-per vad ing soul like
ether, or a soul per vad ing the en tire body like the skin may pro duce
the same re sult.
We can not rea son like this: the soul is atomic be cause it causes
ef fects ex tend ing over the en tire body like a drop of san dal oint ment,
be cause that rea son ing would ap ply to the sense of touch, the skin
also, which we know not to be of atomic size. There fore it is not easy
to de cide the size of the soul when there is no pos i tive proof.
The op po nent re futes the above ob jec tion by quot ing such Sruti
texts as: “The soul abides within the heart” (Pras. Up. III.6), “The self
is in the heart” (Chh. Up. VIII.3.3), “The Self abides in the heart” (Bri.
Up. IV.3.7), “Who is that self? He who is within the heart, sur rounded
by the Pranas, the per son of light, con sist ing of knowl edge,” ex -
pressly de clare that the soul has a spe cial abode or par tic u lar seat in
the body, viz., the heart. There fore it is atomic.
The anal ogy is not faulty. It is quite ap pro pri ate. The two cases
are par al lel. Hence the ar gu men ta tion re sorted to in Su tra 23 is not
ob jec tion able.

tion of the body, may per vade the whole body by its qual ity of in tel li -
gence as the flame per vades the whole room by its rays and thus
ex pe ri ences plea sure and pain through out the whole body.
A fur ther ex am ple is given by way of com par i son to show how
an atomic soul can have ex pe ri ence through out the en tire body.

**ì`{VaoH$mo JÝYdV²Ÿ&**

**Vyatireko gandhavat** II.3.26 (242)

The extension (of the quality of intelligence) beyond (the soul in
which it inheres) is like the odour (which extends beyond the
fragrant object).

**Vyatirekah:** expansion, extension beyond (the object i.e., soul);
**Gandhavat:** like the odour.

Su tra 23 is fur ther elu ci dated by this Su tra.
Just as the sweet fra grance of flow ers ex tends be yond them
and dif fuses through out a larger space, so also the in tel li gence of the
soul, which is atomic, ex tends be yond the soul and per vades the en -
tire body.
If it be said that even the anal ogy in the above Su tra is not ap -
pro pri ate, be cause a qual ity can not be apart from the sub stance, and
hence the light of a lamp is only the lamp in its ten u ous form, the anal -
ogy of per fume will ap ply. Just as though a flower is far away its scent
is felt around, so though the soul is atomic its cog ni tion of the en tire
body is pos si ble. This anal ogy can not be ob jected on the ground that
even the fra grance of a flower is only the sub tle par ti cles of the flower,

be cause our ex pe ri ence is that we feel the fra grance and not any par -
ti cles.

**Tatha cha darsayati** II.3.27 (243)

declares.

The Sruti also, af ter hav ing sig ni fied the soul’s abid ing in the
heart and its atomic size, de clares by means of such pas sages as
“Upto the hairs, upto the tips of the nails” (Kau. Up. IV.20, Bri. Up.
I.4.7), that the soul per vades the whole body by means of in tel li gence,
which is its qual ity.

**n¥WJwnXoemV²Ÿ&**

**Prithagupadesat** II.3.28 (244)
On account of the separate teaching (of the Sruti) (that the soul
pervades the body on account of its quality of intelligence).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 264
```

**Prithak:** separate, different; **Upadesat:** because of teaching or

statement.

This Su tra is a de fence in fa vour of the pre ced ing Su tra where
in tel li gence is used as an at trib ute of the in di vid ual soul and so sep a -
rate from it.
A fur ther ar gu ment is given here to es tab lish the prop o si tion of
the pre vi ous Su tra. Kaushitaki Upanishad de clares “Hav ing by
Prajna, (in tel li gence, knowl edge,) taken pos ses sion of the body”
(III.6). This in di cates that in tel li gence is dif fer ent from the soul be ing
re lated as in stru ment and agent and the soul per vades the en tire
body with this qual ity of in tel li gence.
Again the text “Thou the in tel li gent per son hav ing through the in -
tel li gence of the senses ab sorbed within him self all in tel li gence” (Bri.
Up. II.1.17) shows in tel li gence to be dif fer ent from the agent, i.e., the
Jiva or the in di vid ual soul and so like wise con firms our views.
Though there is no fun da men tal dif fer ence be tween the in di vid -
ual soul and his in tel li gence, they are dif fer ent in the sense that in tel li -
gence is the at trib ute of the in di vid ual soul which is the sub stance.
The in di vid ual soul is the pos sessor of that at trib ute, be cause the
Sruti states a dif fer ence be tween the two.

**Tadgunasaratvat tu tadvyapadesah prajnavat** II.3.29 (245)
But that declaration (as to the atomic size of the soul) is on

Brahman).

**Tadgunasaratvat:** on account of its possessing for its essence the

qualities of that (viz., the Buddhi); **Tu:** but; **Tadvyapadesah:** that

declaration (as to its atomic size); **Prajnavat:** as in the case of the

Intelligent Lord.

The dis cus sion on the true char ac ter of the in di vid ual soul, com -
menced in Su tra 16 is con tin ued.
The word ‘tu’ (but), re futes all that has been said in Sutras 19-28
and de cides that the soul is all-per vad ing.
The next four Sutras are the Siddhanta Sutras which lay down
the cor rect doc trine.
The soul is not of atomic size as the Sruti does not de clare it to
have had an or i gin. The scrip ture de clares that the Su preme Brah -
man en tered the uni verse as the in di vid ual soul and that the in di vid ual
soul is iden ti cal with Brah man, and that the in di vid ual soul is noth ing
else but the Su preme Brah man. If the soul is the Su preme Brah man,
it must be of the same ex tent as Brah man. The scrip ture states Brah -
man to be all-per vad ing. There fore the soul also is all-per vad ing.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 265
```

Your ar gu ment is that though the soul is Anu, it can cog nise all
that goes on in the body be cause of its con tact with the skin. But that
ar gu ment is un ten a ble be cause when a thorn pricks we feel pain only
in the pricked spot. More over, your anal ogy of the lamp and its light
and of the flower and its fra grance has no real ap pli ca bil ity, be cause a
Guna (qual ity) can never be apart from the sub stance (Guna). The
light and the per fume are only sub tle por tions of the flame and the
flower. Fur ther, as Chaitanya is the na ture or Svarupa of the soul, the
soul also must be of the size of the body if there is cog ni tion of the
whole body. This lat ter doc trine has been al ready re futed. There fore
the soul must be in fi nite.
The Jiva is de clared to be atomic by rea son of its iden ti fi ca tion
with the Buddhi.
Ac cord ing to the ex tent of in tel lect, the size of the in di vid ual soul
has been fixed. It is imag ined that the soul is con nected with the
Buddhi or in tel lect and bound. Pass ing out, go ing and com ing are
qual i ties of the in tel lect and are su per im posed on the Jiva or the in di -
vid ual soul. The soul is con sid ered to be atomic on ac count of the lim i -
ta tion of the in tel lect. That the non-trans mi grat ing eter nally free
At man, which nei ther acts nor en joys is de clared to be of the same
size as the Buddhi is due only to its hav ing the qual i ties of the Buddhi
(in tel lect) for its es sence, viz., as long as it is in fic ti tious con nec tion
with the Buddhi. It is sim i lar to imag in ing the all-per vad ing Lord as lim -
ited for the sake of Upasana or wor ship.
Svetasvatara Upanishad (V.9) says, “That liv ing soul is to be
known as part of the hun dredth part of the point of a hair di vided a
hun dred times and yet it is to be in fi nite.” This Sruti text at first states
the soul to be atomic and then teaches it to be in fi nite. This is ap pro -
pri ate only if the atomicity of the soul is met a phor i cal and its in fin ity is
real, be cause both state ments can not be taken in their pri mary sense
at the same time. The in fin ity cer tainly can not be un der stood in a met -
a phor i cal sense, as all the Upanishads aim at show ing that Brah man
con sti tutes the Self of the soul.
The other pas sage (Svet. Up. V.8) which treats of the mea sure
of the soul “The lower one en dowed with the qual ity of mind and the
qual ity of the body, is seen small even like the point of a goad”
teaches the soul’s small size to de pend on its con nec tion with the
qual i ties of the Buddhi, not upon its own Self.
Mundaka Upanishad de clares, “That small (Anu) Self is to be
known by thought” (III.1.9). This Upanishad does not teach that the
soul is of atomic size, as the sub ject of the chap ter is Brah man in so
far as not to be fath omed by the eye, etc., but to be real ised by the
light of knowl edge. Fur ther, the soul can not be of atomic size in the
pri mary sense of the word.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 266
```

There fore the state ment about Anutva (small ness, sub tlety) has
to be un der stood as re fer ring ei ther to the dif fi culty of know ing the
soul, or else to its lim it ing ad juncts.
The Buddhi abides in the heart. So it is said that the soul abides
in the heart. Re ally the soul is all-per vad ing.
As the soul is in volved in the Samsara and as it has for its es -
sence the qual i ties of its lim it ing ad junct viz., Buddhi, it is spo ken of as
min ute.

**`mdXmË_^m{dËdmƒ Z XmofñVÔe©ZmV²Ÿ&**

**Yavadatmabhavitvaccha na doshastaddarsanat** II.3.30 (246)

And there is no defect or fault in what has been said in the
previous Sutra (as the conjunction of the soul with the intellect
exists) so long as the soul (in its relative aspect) exists; because
it is so seen (in the scriptures).

**Yavat:** so long as; **Atmabhavitvat:** as the soul (in its relative aspect)
exists; **Cha:** also, and; **Na doshah:** there is no defect or fault;
**Taddarsanat:** because it is so seen (in the scriptures), as Sruti also
shows that.

An ad di tional rea son is given in sup port of Su tra 29.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent raises an ob jec tion. Very
well, let us then as sume that the trans mi gra tory con di tion of the soul
is due to the qual i ties of the in tel lect form ing its es sence. It will fol low
from this that, as the con junc tion of the in tel lect and soul which are dif -
fer ent en ti ties must nec es sar ily come to an end, the soul when dis -
joined from the in tel lect will ei ther cease to ex ist al to gether or at least
cease to be a Samsarin (in di vid ual soul).
To this ob jec tion this Su tra gives a re ply. There can be no such
de fect in the ar gu ment of the pre vi ous Su tra, be cause this con nec tion
with the Buddhi (in tel lect) lasts so long as the soul’s state of Samsara
is not brought to an end by means of per fect knowl edge. As long as
the soul’s con nec tion with the Buddhi, its lim it ing ad junct lasts, so
long the in di vid ual soul re mains in di vid ual soul, in volved in trans mi -
gra tory ex is tence.
There is no Jiva or in di vid ual soul with out iden ti fi ca tion with in -
tel lect. The con nec tion of the soul with the in tel lect will cease only by
right knowl edge. The scrip ture de clares “I know that Per son of sunlike
lus tre be yond dark ness. A man who knows Him passes over death,
there is no other path to go (Svet. Up. III.8).
How is it known that the soul is con nected with the Buddhi as
long as it ex ists? We re ply, be cause that is seen, viz., in scrip ture. It is
known from the Srutis that this con nec tion is not sev ered even at
death. The scrip ture de clares, “He who is within the heart, con sist ing
of knowl edge, sur rounded by Pranas, the per son of light, he re main -
ing the same wan ders along the two worlds as if think ing, as if mov -

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 267
```

ing” (Bri. Up. IV.3.7). Here the term “con sist ing of knowl edge” means
‘con sist ing of Buddhi’. The pas sage “He re main ing in the same wan -
ders along the two worlds” de clares that the Self, even when go ing to
an other world, is not sep a rated from the Buddhi etc. The term “as if
think ing,” “as if mov ing” mean that the in di vid ual soul does not think
and move on its own ac count, but only through its as so ci a tion with the
Buddhi. The in di vid ual soul thinks as it were, and moves as it were,
be cause the in tel lect to which it is joined re ally moves and thinks.
The con nec tion of the in di vid ual soul with the in tel lect, its lim it ing
ad junct, de pends on wrong knowl edge. Wrong knowl edge
(Mithyajnana) can not cease ex cept through per fect knowl edge.
There fore, as long as there does not arise the reali sa tion of Brah man
or Brahmajnana, so long the con nec tion of the soul with the in tel lect
and its other lim it ing ad juncts does not come to an end.

**nw§ñËdm{XdV² Ëdñ` gVmo@{^ì`{º$`moJmV²Ÿ&**

**Pumstvadivat tvasya sato’bhivyaktiyogat** II.3.31 (247)
On account of the appropriateness of the manifestation of that
(connection) which exists (potentially) like virile power, etc.

**Pumstvadivat:** like the virile power etc.; **Tu:** verily, but; **Asya:** its, i.e.,
of the connection with the intellect; **Satah:** existing;
**Abhivyaktiyogat:** on account of the manifestation being possible,
because of appropriateness of the manifestation.

A proof is now given in sup port of Su tra 29 by show ing the per -
pet ual con nec tion be tween the in di vid ual soul and the in tel lect. The
word ‘tu’ (but), is used in or der to set aside the ob jec tion raised above.
An ob jec tion is raised that in Sushupti or deep sleep and
Pralaya there can be no con nec tion with the in tel lect, as the scrip ture
de clares, “Then he be comes united with the True; he is gone to his
own” (Chh. Up. VI.8.1). How then can it be said that the con nec tion
with the in tel lect lasts so long as the in di vid ual soul ex ists?
The Su tra re futes it and says that this con nec tion ex ists in a sub -
tle or po ten tial form even in deep sleep. Had it not been for this, it
could not have be come man i fest in the wak ing state. Such con nec -
tion is clear from the ap pro pri ate ness of such con nec tion be com ing
man i fest dur ing cre ation, af ter dis so lu tion and dur ing the wak ing state
af ter sleep, as in the case of vi ril ity dor mant in boy hood and man i fest
in man hood.
The con nec tion of the soul with the in tel lect ex ists po ten tially
dur ing deep sleep and the pe riod of dis so lu tion and again be comes
man i fest at the time of wak ing and the time of cre ation.
Vir ile power be comes man i fest in man hood only if it ex ists in a
fine or po ten tial state in the body. Hence this con nec tion with the in tel -
lect lasts so long as the soul ex ists in its Samsara-state.

Otherwise (if no intellect existed) there would result either
constant perception or constant non-perception, or else a

**Nityopalabdhyanupalabdhiprasanga:** there would result perpetual

**Niyamah:** restrictive rule; **Va:** or; **Anyatha:** otherwise. ( **Upalabdhi:**

The in ter nal or gan (Antahkarana) which con sti tutes the lim it ing
ad junct of the soul is called in dif fer ent places by dif fer ent names such
as Manas (mind), Buddhi (in tel lect), Vijnana (knowl edge), and Chitta
(thought) etc. When it is in a state of doubt it is called Manas; when it
is in a state of de ter mi na tion it is called Buddhi. Now we must nec es -
sar ily ac knowl edge the ex is tence of such an in ter nal or gan, be cause
oth er wise there would re sult ei ther per pet ual per cep tion or per pet ual
non-per cep tion. There would be per pet ual per cep tion when ever
there is a con junc tion of the soul, and senses and the ob jects of
senses, the three to gether form ing the in stru ments of per cep tion. Or
else, if on the con junc tion of the three causes the ef fect did not fol low,
there would be per pet ual non-per cep tion. But nei ther of these two al -
ter na tives is ac tu ally observ+ed.
Or else we will have to ac cept the lim i ta tion of the power ei ther
of the soul or of the senses. But the lim it ing of power is not pos si ble,
as the At man is change less. It can not be said that the power of the
senses which is not ob structed ei ther in the pre vi ous mo ment or in the
sub se quent mo ment is lim ited in the mid dle.
There fore we have to ac knowl edge the ex is tence of an in ter nal
or gan (Antahkarana) through whose con nec tion and dis con nec tion
per cep tion and non-per cep tion take place. The scrip ture de clares,
“My mind was else where, I did not see, my mind was else where, I did
not hear; for a man sees with his mind and hears with the mind” (Bri.
Up. I.5.3). The scrip ture fur ther shows that de sire, rep re sen ta tion,
doubt, faith, want of faith, mem ory, for get ful ness, shame, re flec tion,
fear, all this is mind.

There fore there ex ists an in ter nal or gan, the Antahkarana, and
the con nec tion of the soul with the in ter nal or gan causes the At man to
ap pear as the in di vid ual soul or as the soul its Samsara state as ex -
plained in Su tra 29. The ex pla na tion given in Su tra 29 is there fore an

(The soul is) an agent on account of the scripture having a

purport thereby.

**Karta:** agent; **Sastrarthavattvat:** in order that the scriptures may

have a meaning, on account of the scriptures having a purport.

An other char ac ter is tic of the in di vid ual soul is be ing stated.
The ques tion as re gards the size of the soul has been stated.
Now an other char ac ter is tic of the soul is taken up for dis cus sion. The
Jiva is a doer or an agent, for oth er wise the scrip tural in junc tions will
be use less. On that as sump tion scrip tural in junc tions such as “He is
to sac ri fice,” “He is to make an ob la tion into the fire,” “He is to give,”
etc., have a pur port, oth er wise they would be purportless. The scrip -
tures en join cer tain acts to be done by the agent. If the soul be not an
agent these in junc tions would be come mean ing less. On that sup po -
si tion there is mean ing to the fol low ing pas sage also, “For, it is he who
sees, hears, per ceives, con ceives, acts, he is the per son whose self
is knowl edge” (Pras. Up. IV.9). “He who de sires to at tain heaven, has
to per form sac ri fices; and he, who de sires to at tain sal va tion, has to
wor ship Brah man in med i ta tion.”

**{dhmamonXoemV²Ÿ&**

**Viharopadesat** II.3.34 (250)

And on account of (the Sruti) teaching (its) wandering about.

**Vihara:** wandering at will, play, sporting about; **Upadesat:** on account

of declaration, as Sruti declares.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 33 is given.
The Sruti de clares “The im mor tal one goes wher ever he likes”
(Bri. Up. IV.3.12), and again “He tak ing the senses along with him
moves about ac cord ing to his plea sure, within his own body” (Bri. Up.
II.1.18). These pas sages which give a de scrip tion of the wan der ing of
the soul in the dream in di cate clearly that the soul is an agent.

**CnXmZmV²Ÿ&**

**Upadanat** II.3.35 (251)
(Also it is a doer) on account of its taking the organs.

**Upadanat:** on account of its taking (the organs).

An other ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 33 is given.
The text quoted in the last Su tra also in di cates that the soul in
dream state takes the or gans with it. “Hav ing taken through the in tel li -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 270

gence of the senses, in tel li gence, and hav ing taken the senses” (Bri.
Up. II.1.18, 19). This clearly shows that the soul is an agent.
It is a doer or an agent be cause it is said to use the senses. The
in di vid ual soul is to be ad mit ted as the agent, be cause he is de scribed
in Sruti to take the senses along with him as in stru ments of his work,
while roam ing within his own body dur ing the dream state. “Thus, he
tak ing the senses along with him, moves about within his own body,
just as he pleases.” (Bri. Up. II.1.18).
In the Gita also we find “when the soul ac quires a body and

when he aban dons it, he seizes these and goes with them, as the
wind takes fra grance from the flow ers” (Gita. XV.8).

**Vyapadesaccha kriyayam na
chennirdesaviparyayah** II.3.36 (252)

(The soul is an agent) also because it is designated as such
with regard to actions; if it were not so, there would be a
change of designation.

**Vyapadesat:** on account of mention, from a statement of Sruti; **Cha:**
also, and; **Kriyayam:** in respect of performance of rites; **Na chet:** if it
were not so, or else, otherwise; **Nirdesaviparyayah:** reversal of the
statement, change of designation.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 33 is con tin ued.
In the pas sage _“Vijnanam yajnam tanute, Karmani tanute’pi
cha”_ —“In tel li gence (i.e., the in tel li gent per son, Jiva) per forms sac ri -
fices, and it also per forms all acts” (Tait. Up.II.5), by ‘In tel li gence’ the

soul is meant and not the Buddhi. This clearly shows that the soul is
an agent.
Vijnana re fers to Jiva and not to Buddhi, be cause if Buddhi is re -
ferred to, the word would be ‘Vijnanena’. The nom i na tive case in
_‘Vijnanam yajnam tanute’_ , should be in stru men tal case, ‘Vijnanena’,
‘by in tel li gence’ mean ing through its in stru men tal ity.
We see that in an other text where the Buddhi is meant the word
‘in tel li gence’ is ex hib ited in the in stru men tal case “Hav ing through the
in tel li gence of these senses it takes all un der stand ing” (Bri. Up.
II.1.17). In the pas sage un der dis cus sion, on the con trary, the word

‘in tel li gence’ is given in the char ac ter is tic of the agent, viz., nom i na -
tive case and there fore in di cates the soul which is dis tinct from the
Buddhi.

**CnbpãYdX{Z`_...Ÿ&**

**Upalabdhivadaniyamah** II.3.37 (253)

As in the case of perception (there is) no rule (here also).

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 271
```

**Upalabdhivat:** as in the case of perception; **Aniyamah:** (there is) no

rule.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 33 is con tin ued.
An ob jec tion is raised that if the soul were a free agent, then why
should he do any act pro duc tive of harm ful ef fects? He would have
done only what is ben e fi cial to him and not both good and evil ac tions.
This ob jec tion is re futed in this Su tra. Just as the soul, al though
he is free, per ceives both pleas ant and un pleas ant things, so also he
per forms both good and evil ac tions. There is no rule that he should
per form only what is ben e fi cial and avoid what is bad or harm ful.
In the per for mance of ac tions, the soul is not ab so lutely free as
he de pends on dif fer ences of place, time and ef fi cient causes. But an
agent does not cease to be so be cause he is in need of as sis tance. A
cook re mains the agent in ac tion of cook ing, al though he needs fuel,
wa ter, etc. His func tion as a cook ex ists at all times.

**e{º${dn`©`mV²Ÿ&**

**Saktiviparyayat** II.3.38 (254)

On account of the reversal of power (of the Buddhi).

**Saktiviparyayat:** on account of the reversal of power (of the Buddhi).

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 33 is con tin ued.
If the Buddhi which is an in stru ment be comes the agent and
ceases to func tion as an in stru ment there would take place a re ver sal
of power, i.e., the in stru men tal power which per tains to the Buddhi
would have to be set aside and to be re placed by the power of an
agent.
If the Buddhi has the power of an agent, it must be ad mit ted that
it is also the ob ject of self-con scious ness (Aham-pratyaya), as we see
that ev ery where ac tiv ity is pre ceded by self-con scious ness: “I go, I
come, I eat, I drink, I do, I en joy.”
If the Buddhi is en dowed with the power of an agent and af fects
all things, we have to as sume for it an other in stru ment by means of
which it af fects ev ery thing, be cause ev ery doer needs an in stru ment.
Hence the whole dis pute is about a name only. There is no real dif fer -
ence, since in ei ther case that which is dif fer ent from the in stru ment of
ac tion is ad mit ted to be the agent. In ei ther case an agent dif fer ent
from the in stru ment has to be ad mit ted.

**Samadhyabhavaccha** II.3.39 (255)

**Samadhyabhavat:** on account of the impossibility of Samadhi; **Cha:**

and, also. ( **Samadhi:** superconscious state; **Abhavat:** for want, for
impossibility, as it becomes an impossible thing).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 272
```

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 33 is con tin ued.
If the soul is not a doer, there will be non-ex is tence of at tain ment
of lib er a tion. If the Jiva or soul is not an agent, then the reali sa tion pre -
scribed by Sruti texts like “The At man is to be real ised” (Bri. Up.
II.4.5.) through Sam adhi would be im pos si ble. The med i ta tion taught
in the Vedanta texts is pos si ble only if the soul is the agent. “Ver ily, the
At man is to be seen, to be heard, to be per ceived, to be searched.”
“The Self we must seek out, we must try to un der stand” (Chh. Up.
VIII.7.1.) “Med i tate on the Self as OM” (Mun. Up. II.2.6). There from
also it fol lows that the soul is an agent.
“The soul will not be ca pa ble of prac tis ing hear ing, rea son ing,
re flec tion, and med i ta tion” which lead to Sam adhi and the at tain ment
of Knowl edge of the Im per ish able. Hence there will be no eman ci pa -
tion for the soul. There fore it is es tab lished that the soul alone is the
agent, but not the Buddhi.

**Yatha cha takshobhayatha** II.3.40 (256)
And as the carpenter is both.

**Yatha:** as; **Cha:** also, and; **Taksha:** the carpenter; **Ubhayatha:** in
both ways, is both.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 33 is con tin ued.
That the in di vid ual soul is an agent has been proved by the rea -
sons set forth in Sutras 33 to 39. We now have to con sider whether
this agency is its real na ture or only a su per im po si tion due to its lim it -
ing ad juncts. The Nyaya School main tains that it is its very na ture.
This Su tra re futes it and de clares that it is su per im posed on the
soul and not real. Such doership is not the soul’s na ture, be cause if it
is so, there could be no lib er a tion, just as fire, be ing hot in its na ture,
can never be free from heat. Do ing is es sen tially of the na ture of pain.
You can not say that even if there is the power of do ing, eman ci pa tion
can come when there is noth ing to do, be cause the power of do ing
will re sult in do ing at some time or other. The Sruti calls the At man as
hav ing an eter nally pure con scious and free na ture. How could that
be if doership is its na ture? Hence, its doership is due to its iden ti fi ca -
tion with a lim it ing func tion. So there is no soul as doer or enjoyer
apart from Para-Brah man. You can not say that in that case God will
be come a Samsarin, be cause doership and en joy ment are due only
to Avidya.
The body of the car pen ter is not the cause of his func tion. His
tools are the cause. Even so the soul is a doer only through the mind
and the senses. The scrip tural in junc tions do not com mand do ing but

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 273
```

com mand acts to be done on the ba sis of such doership which is due
to Avidya.
The Sruti de clares “This At man is non-at tached” (Bri. Up.
IV.3.15). Just as in or di nary life, a car pen ter suf fers when he is work -
ing with his tools and is happy when he leaves his work, so does the
At man suf fer when he is ac tive in the wak ing and dream states
through his con nec tion with the in tel lect, etc., and is bliss ful when he
ceases to be an agent as in the state of deep sleep.
The scrip tural in junc tions in pre scrib ing cer tain acts re fer to the
con di tioned state of the self. By na ture the soul is in ac tive. It be comes
ac tive through con nec tion with its Upadhis or lim it ing ad juncts, the in -
tel lect, etc. Doership re ally be longs to the in tel lect. Eter nal Upalabdhi
or Con scious ness is in the soul. Doership im plies Ahamkara or
ego-con scious ness. Hence such doership does not be long to the
soul as its na ture but be longs to the in tel lect.
The scrip tural in junc tions in pre scrib ing cer tain acts pre sup pose
an agentship es tab lished some how on ac count of Avidya or ig no -
rance, but do not them selves aim at es tab lish ing the di rect agentship
of the Self. The agentship of the Self does not con sti tute its real na -
ture be cause scrip ture teaches that its true Self is Brah man. We,
there fore, con clude that the Ve dic in junc tions are op er a tive with ref er -
ence to that agentship of the soul which is due to Avidya.
Nor can you in fer doership from the de scrip tion of Vihara (play
or ac tiv ity) in dreams, be cause the con nec tion with the mind or in tel -
lect con tin ues in dreams. Even in the state of dream the in stru ments
of the Self are not al to gether at rest; be cause scrip ture de clares that
even then it is con nected with the Buddhi. “Hav ing be come a dream,
to gether with Buddhi, it passes be yond this world.” Smriti also says,
“when the senses be ing at rest, the mind not be ing at rest is oc cu pied
with the ob jects, that state know to be a dream.”
It is clearly es tab lished that the agentship of the soul is due to its
lim it ing ad junct Buddhi only.

**Parat:** from the Supreme Lord; **Tu:** but, indeed; **Tat:** agency,
agentship; **Sruteh:** from Sruti, so declares the Sruti.

```
A lim i ta tion to Su tra 33 is stated.
```
```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 274
```

We now en ter on the dis cus sion whether the agentship char ac -
ter is ing the in di vid ual soul in the state of ig no rance on ac count of its
lim it ing ad juncts is in de pend ent of the Lord or de pend ent on Him.
The Purvapakshin main tains that the soul as far as it is an agent
does not de pend on the Lord.
The word ‘tu’ (but), is em ployed in or der to re move the doubt
raised by the Purvapakshin. The view that the soul’s doership is due
to its de sires and its pos ses sion of the senses as in stru ments and not
to the Lord is wrong, be cause the Sruti de clares that Lord is the
cause.
The agency of the soul is also due to the Su preme Lord. It can
be un der stood from Sruti that the agentship of the in di vid ual soul is
ver ily sub or di nate to and con trolled by the Su preme Lord. The soul
does good and bad deeds be ing so di rected by the Lord.
Sruti de clares, “He makes him, whom He wishes to lead up from
these worlds do good deeds; He makes him, whom He wishes to lead
down from these worlds, do bad deeds.” (Kau. Up. III.8) and, again,
“He who dwell ing within the Self pulls the Self within” (Sat. Br.
XIV.6.7.30). “The Uni ver sal Soul en ter ing within, gov erns the in di vid -
ual souls”—“ _Antah pravishtah sasta jivanam_ ” “The Lord is within all,
the Ruler of all crea tures.”
You can not say that that will cause the at tri bu tion of par tial ity
(Vaishamya) and cru elty (Nairghrinya) to the Lord, be cause He acts
ac cord ing to Dharma (merit) and Adharma (de merit). You may re ply
that these are due to doership and if doership is due to the Lord, how
can the Lord act ac cord ing to Dharma and Adharma?
We re ply that the Sruti says that the soul is the doer and de -
clares as cause of doership the Su preme Lord who is the bestower of
the fruits of ac tions, who is im ma nent in all, who is the wit ness of all
ac tions, and who is the in spirer and guider of all.

**Kritaprayatnapekshastu
vihitapratishiddhavaiyarthyadibhyah** II.3.42 (258)

But (the Lord’s making the soul act) depends on the works
done (by it), for otherwise there will be uselessness of the
scriptural injunctions and prohibitions.

**Kritaprayatnapekshah:** depends on works done; **Tu:** but;
**Vihita-pratishiddha-avaiyarthyadibhyah:** so that the scriptural
injunctions and prohibitions may not be meaningless. ( **Vihita:**
ordained; **Pratishiddha:** prohibited; **Avaiyarthyadibhyah:** on
account of non-meaninglessness.)

This Su tra pro ceeds to nar row the scope of Su tra 41 within cer -
tain lim its.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 275
```

If causal agency be longs to the Lord, it fol lows that He must be
cruel and un just and that the soul has to un dergo con se quences of
what it has not done. He must be cruel and whim si cal too as He
makes some per sons do good acts and oth ers evil deeds. This Su tra
re futes this doubt.
The word ‘tu’ (but), re moves the ob jec tions. The Lord al ways di -
rects the soul ac cord ing to its good or bad ac tions done in pre vi ous
births. He be stows good and bad fruits ac cord ing to the soul’s good
and bad ac tions. He is the rain which al ways causes each seed to
fruc tify ac cord ing to its power. Though doership is de pend ent on the
Lord, do ing is the soul’s act. What the soul does the Lord causes to be
done. Such do ing is due to deeds done in pre vi ous birth and Vasanas
which, again, are due to pre vi ous Kar mas and so on, Samsara be ing
with out be gin ning (Anadi). As Samsara is beginningless there will al -
ways be pre vi ous births with ac tions per formed in those births for the
guid ance of the Lord. Hence He can not be ac cused of be ing cruel,
un just and whim si cal. To give fruits the Lord de pends on the soul’s ac -
tions. If this were not so, the scrip tural in junc tions and pro hi bi tions
would be mean ing less. If Lord does not de pend on the soul’s ac tions
for giv ing fruit, ef fort or ex er tion (Purushartha) will have no place at all.
The soul will gain noth ing by fol low ing these in junc tions.
More over, time, place and cau sa tion will be ca pri ciously op er a -
tive and not ac cord ing to the law of cause and ef fect, if our Karma is
not the in stru men tal cause, and the Lord the Su per vis ing Cause.

(The soul is) a part of the Lord on account of difference

non-different from Brahman); because in some (Vedic texts)
(Brahman) is spoken of as being fishermen, knaves, etc.

**Amsah:** part; **Nanavyapadesat:** on account of difference being
declared; **Anyatha:** otherwise; **Cha:** and; **Api:** also;
**Dasakitavaditvam:** being fisher-men, knaves, etc.; **Adhiyata:** read;
**Eke:** some (Srutis, Sakhas of the Vedas).

This Su tra shows that the in di vid ual soul is dif fer ent from as well
as the same with Brah man.
In the last topic it has been shown that the Lord rules the soul.
Now the ques tion of the re la tion of the in di vid ual soul to Brah man is
taken up. Is it that of mas ter and ser vant or as be tween fire and its
sparks?

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 276
```

The Purvapakshin holds that the re la tion is like that of mas ter
and ser vant, be cause that con nec tion only is well known to be the re -
la tion of ruler (Lord) and ruled (sub ject).
To this the Su tra says that the soul must be con sid ered a part of
the Lord, just as a spark is a part of the fire. But then the soul is not ac -
tu ally a part, but a part as it were. It is an imag ined part only, be cause
Brah man can not have any parts. Brah man is Nishkala, with out parts.
He is Akhanda (in di vis i ble). He is Niravayava (with out limbs).
Why then should it be taken as a part and not iden ti cal with the
Lord? Be cause the scrip tures de clare a dif fer ence be tween them in
texts like “That self it is which we must search out, that it is we must try
to un der stand” (Chh. Up. VIII.7.1). “He who knows Him be comes a
Muni” (Bri. Up. IV.4.22). “He who dwell ing within the self, pulls the self
from within” (Bri. Up. III.7.23). “The At man is to be seen” (Bri. Up.
II.4.5). This dif fer ence is spo ken of from the rel a tive view point. They
are iden ti cal from the ab so lute view point.
The text “Brah man is the fish er men, Brah man the slaves, Brah -
man these gam blers” etc., in di cate that even such low per sons are in
re al ity Brah man and that all in di vid ual souls, men, women and chil -
dren are all Brah man.
The same view point is set forth in other pas sages such as
“Thou art woman, Thou art man, Thou art the youth, Thou art the
maiden; Thou as an old man tot ters along on Thy staff, Thou art born
with Thy face turned ev ery where” (Svet. Up. IV.3). Texts like “There is
no other but He” and sim i lar ones es tab lish the same truth. Non-dif fer -
en ti ated in tel li gence be longs to the soul and the Lord alike, just as
heat be longs to the sparks as well as the fire.
From these two views of dif fer ence, and non-dif fer ence, there
re sults the com pre hen sive view of the soul be ing a part of the Lord.

**_ÝÌdUm©ƒŸ&**

**Mantravarnaccha** II.3.44 (260)

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 43, that the in di vid ual soul is a
part of Brah man is given.
A fur ther rea son is given to show that the soul is a part of the
Lord. “Such is the great ness of it; greater than it is the Per son. One
foot of It are all these be ings, three feet of It are the im mor tal in
heaven,” (Chh. Up. III.12.6) where be ings in clud ing souls are said to
be a foot or part of the Lord. nmXmo@ñ` gdm© ^yVm{Z (One foot, i.e., the fourth

part of Him are all be ings, the whole cre ation cov ers only a frac tion of
Him). Purusha Sukta: Rigveda: X.90.3, de clares the same thing. “All
the be ings are but a foot of Him”.
The word ‘pada’ and ‘amsa’ are iden ti cal. Both mean part or a
por tion.
Hence we con clude that the in di vid ual soul is a part of the Lord,
and again from the fol low ing rea son.

**A{n M ñ_`©VoŸ&**

**Api cha smaryate** II.3.45 (261)

And it is so stated in the Smriti.

The ar gu ment that the in di vid ual soul is a part of Brah man is
con cluded here.
The Smriti also says so—that the in di vid ual soul is a part of
Brah man. “An eter nal por tion of My self be comes the in di vid ual soul in
the world of life” (Bhagavad Gita: XV.7).

**àH$mem{XdÞ¡d§ na...Ÿ&**

**Prakasadivannaivam parah** II.3.46 (262)

The Supreme Lord is not (affected by pleasure and pain) like
this (individual soul) just as light (is unaffected by the shaking
of its reflections).

**Prakasadivat:** like light, etc.; **Na:** is not; **Evam:** thus, like this, like the
individual soul; **Parah:** the Supreme Lord.

The spe ci al ity of the Su preme Lord is shown in this Su tra.
Here the Purvapakshin raises an other ob jec tion. If the soul is a
part of the Lord, the Lord also must ex pe ri ence plea sure and pain like
the soul. We see in or di nary life that the en tire Ramakrishna suf fers
from the pain af fect ing his hand or foot or some other limb. Hence at -
tain ment of God would mean max i mum grief and pain, and the old
lim ited pain of in di vid ual soul would be far better.
This Su tra re futes it. The Lord does not ex pe ri ence plea sure
and pain like the in di vid ual soul. The in di vid ual soul iden ti fies it self
with the body, the senses and the mind, on ac count of ig no rance, and
there fore ex pe ri ences plea sure and pain. The Su preme Lord nei ther
iden ti fies him self with a body, nor imag ines him self to be af flicted by
pain.
The pain of the in di vid ual soul also is not real but imag i nary only.
It is due to non-dis crim i na tion of the Self from the body, senses and
mind which are the prod ucts of Avidya or ig no rance.
Just as a man feels the pain of a burn or cut which af fects his
body by er ro ne ously iden ti fy ing him self with the lat ter, so also he feels
the pain which af fects oth ers such as sons or friends, by er ro ne ously

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 278
```

iden ti fy ing him self with them. He en ters as it were into them through
Moha or love and imag ines “I am the son, I am the friend.” This clearly
shows that the feel ing of pain is due merely to the er ror of false imag i -
na tion.
Some men and women are sit ting to gether and talk ing. If then
some body calls out “the son has died”, grief is pro duced in the minds
of those who have Moha or love for sons on ac count of er ro ne ous
imag i na tion, iden ti fi ca tion, and con nec tion, but not in the minds of re -
li gious as cet ics or Sannyasins who have freed them selves from that
imag i na tion. If even a man of right knowl edge who has be come an as -
cetic has no pain or grief con se quent on death of re la tions or friends,
God who is Su preme and alone, who is pure con scious ness, who is
eter nal pure in tel li gence, who sees noth ing be side the Self for which
there are no ob jects, can have no pain at all.
To il lus trate this view the Su tra in tro duces a com par i son like
light etc. Just as the light of the sun which is all-per vad ing be comes
straight or bent by com ing in con tact with par tic u lar ob jects, but does
not re ally be come so, or the ether of a pot seems to move when the
pot is moved, but does not re ally move, or as the sun does not trem ble
al though its im age which is re flected in wa ter trem bles, so also the
Lord is not af fected by plea sure, pain or grief al though plea sure and
pain etc., are felt by that part of Him, which is called the in di vid ual soul
which is a prod uct of ig no rance and is lim ited by Buddhi, etc.
Just as the sun does not be come con tam i nated by its touch
through its parts, the rays with the im pu ri ties of the earth, so also the
Su preme Lord does not be come af fected by the en joy ment and suf -
fer ing of the in di vid ual soul, though lat ter is part and par cel of the for -
mer.
When the soul’s in di vid ual state due to ig no rance is sub lat ed, it
be comes Brah man, “Thou art That” etc. Thus the Su preme Lord is not
af fected by the pain of the in di vid ual soul.

**ñ_apÝV MŸ&**

**Smaranti Cha** II.3.47 (263)

The Smritis also state (that).

**Smaranti:** the Smritis state; **Cha:** and, also.

“Of the two, the Su preme Self is said to be eter nal, de void of
qual i ties. It is not touched by the fruits of ac tions, any more than a lo -
tus leaf by wa ter.” The Smriti texts like these state that the Su preme
Lord does not ex pe ri ence plea sure and pain.

**Anujnapariharau dehasambandhajjyotiradivat** II.3.48 (264)

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 279
```

Injunctions and prohibitions (are possible) on account of the

connection (of the Self) with the body, as in the case of light,

etc.

**Anujnapariharau:** injunctions and prohibitions; **Dehasambandhat:**
on account of connection with the body; **Jyotiradivat:** like light etc.

The ne ces sity for ob ser vance of man da tory and pro hib i tory
rules is ex plained.
The At man or the Su preme Self is one. There can be no in junc -
tions and pro hi bi tions with re gard to the At man. But in junc tions and
pro hi bi tions are pos si ble when it is con nected with a body. What are
those per mis sions and in junc tions? “He is to ap proach his wife at the
proper time.” “He is not to ap proach the wife of his Guru.” “He is to kill
the an i mal de voted to Agnistoma” and “He is not to hurt any be ing.”
Fire is one only but the fire of the fu neral pyre is re jected and
that of a sac ri fice is ac cepted. Some things con sist ing of earth, like di -
a monds, are de sired; other things con sist ing of earth, like dead bod -
ies, are shunned. The urine and dung of cows are con sid ered pure
and used as such; those of other an i mals are re jected. Wa ter poured
from a clean ves sel or of fered by a clean per son is to be ac cepted;
that con tained in an un clean ves sel or of fered by an un clean man is to
be re jected. Sim i lar is the case with the At man.
When the soul is in a state of at tach ment to the body, eth i cal
ideas of pu rity and im pu rity have full ap pli ca tion.

**AgÝVVoümì`{VH$a...Ÿ&**

**Asantateschavyatikarah** II.3.49 (265)

And on account of the non-extension (of the soul beyond its

own body) there is no confusion (of results of actions).

**Asantateh:** on account of non-extension (beyond its own body);
**Cha:** and; **Avyatikarah:** there is no confusion (of results of actions).

The dis cus sion on the spe cial char ac ter is tic of the in di vid ual
soul is con tin ued.
An ob jec tion is raised that on ac count of the unity of the self
there would re sult a con fu sion of the re sults of ac tions, there be ing
only one mas ter, i.e., one soul to en joy the fruits of ac tions. This Su tra
re futes such a pos si bil ity.
This is not so, be cause there is no ex ten sion of the act ing and
en joy ing self, i.e., no con nec tion on its part with all bod ies. The in di -
vid ual soul de pends on its ad juncts, and there is also non-ex ten sion
of the soul on ac count of the non-ex ten sion of those ad juncts. The in -
di vid ual souls are dif fer ent from each other. Each soul is con nected
with a par tic u lar body, mind, etc.
The in di vid ual soul has no con nec tion with all the bod ies at the
same time. He is con nected with one body only and he is af fected by

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 280
```

the pe cu liar prop er ties of that one alone. There fore the ef fects of
works done by the soul in one body be longs to him in re spect of that
body only and not of any other body. All the in di vid u als are not af -
fected by the works done by a par tic u lar in di vid ual.
There will be no pos si bil ity for the At man, as it is one, to ex pe ri -
ence all the plea sures and all the pains of all the bod ies, be cause the
bod ies are dis con nected.
There fore there is no con fu sion of ac tions or fruits of ac tions.

**Am^mg Ed MŸ&**

**Abhasa eva cha** II.3.50 (266)

And (the individual soul is) only a reflection (of Paramatman or
the Supreme Lord).

**Abhasa:** a reflection; **Eva:** only; **Cha:** and.

Ac cord ing to Vedanta, the in di vid ual soul is only a re flec tion of
Brah man or the Su preme Soul in the mind like the re flec tion of the sun
in the wa ter. Just as the re flec tions of the sun in dif fer ent pots of wa ter
are dif fer ent, so also the re flec tions of the Su preme Soul in dif fer ent
minds are dif fer ent. Just as, when one re flected im age of the sun
trem bles, an other re flected im age does not on that ac count trem ble
also, so also when a par tic u lar soul ex pe ri ences fruits of his ac tions,
viz., plea sure and pain, it is not shared by other souls. When the in di -
vid ual soul in one body is un der go ing the ef fects of his ac tions, the
soul in any other body is not af fected on that ac count.
For those, such as the Sankhyas, the Vaiseshikas and the
Naiyayikas on the con trary, who main tain that there are many souls
and all of them all-per vad ing, it fol lows that there must be a con fu sion
of ac tions and re sults, be cause each soul is pres ent ev ery where near
to those causes which pro duce plea sure and pain.
Ac cord ing to the opin ion of the Sankhyas, there ex ist many
all-per vad ing selfs, whose na ture is pure in tel li gence, de void of qual i -
ties and of unsurpassable ex cel lence. For the com mon pur pose of all
of them there ex ists the Pradhana through which the souls ob tain en -
joy ment and re lease.
In the Sankhya phi los o phy the in di vid ual soul has been stated to
be all-per vad ing. If this view be ac cepted there would be con fu sion of
works and their ef fects. This view of Sankhyas is there fore an un fair
con clu sion.
There fore there can be no con fu sion of the re sults of ac tion.

**AX¥ï>m{Z`_mV²Ÿ&**

**Adrishtaniyamat** II.3.51 (267)

There being no fixity about the unseen principle (there would
result confusion of works and their effects for those who
believe in many souls, each all-pervading).

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 3 281
```

**Adrishtaniyamat:** There being no fixity about the unseen principle.
( **Adrishta:** the fate, the accumulated stock of previous actions,
waiting as a latent force to bring forth fruits in future, merit or demerit
acquired by the souls by thoughts, words and actions; **Aniyamat:** for
want of any binding rule, on account of non-determinateness.)

The dis cus sion be gun in Su tra 50 is con tin ued.
Sutras 51 to 53 re fute the doc trine of the Sankhyas and other
schools about the plu ral ity of souls, each of which is all-per vad ing. It
leads to ab sur di ties.
This con fu sion can not be avoided by bring ing the Adrishta or
un seen prin ci ple, be cause if all the souls equally are all-per vad ing,
there can not be any bind ing rule as to upon which of them the force
will act.
Ac cord ing to the Sankhyas, the Adrishta does not in here in the
soul but in the Pradhana which is com mon to all souls. Hence there is
noth ing to fix that a par tic u lar Adrishta op er ates in a par tic u lar soul.
The doc trine of the other two schools is open to the same ob jec -
tion. Ac cord ing to the Nyaya and Vaiseshika schools, the un seen
prin ci ple is cre ated by the con junc tion of the soul with the mind. Here
also there is noth ing to fix that a par tic u lar Adrishta be longs to a par -
tic u lar soul, as ev ery soul is all-per vad ing and there fore equally con -
nected with all minds.
There fore the con fu sion of re sults is un avoid able.

**A{^gÝÜ`m{Xîd{n M¡d_²Ÿ&**

**Abhisandhyadishu api chaivam** II.3.52 (268)

And this is also the case in resolutions, etc.

**Abhisandhyadishu:** in resolutions, etc.; **Api:** even; **Cha:** and;
**Evam:** thus, like this, in the like manner.

The dis cus sion be gun in Su tra 50 is con tin ued.
The same log i cal de fect will ap ply also to the re solve to do ac -
tions. There will be no or der li ness of re solves to do ac tions. That is
want of or der also in mat ters of per sonal de ter mi na tion, etc., if the in -
di vid ual soul be ad mit ted to be all-per vad ing.
If it be held that the res o lu tion which one makes to get some -
thing or to avoid some thing will al lot the Adrishta to par tic u lar souls,
even then there will be this con fu sion of re sults of ac tions, be cause
res o lu tions are formed by the con junc tion of the soul and the mind.
There fore the same ar gu ment ap plies here also.

If the in di vid ual soul is all-per vad ing, there can not be any or der
in mo tives or mat ters of per sonal de ter mi na tion such as “I will do a
cer tain thing” or “I will not do a cer tain thing” be cause in such a case,
ev ery one be comes con scious of the de ter mi na tion of ev ery other.
There fore no or der of de ter mi na tion and its putt ing it into ac tion can

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 282
```

be main tained. More over col li sion be tween wills can not be avoided.
But or der is found in this world ev ery where.
There fore it is es tab lished that the soul is not all-per vad ing.

**àXoem{X{V MoÞmÝV^m©dmV²Ÿ&**

**Pradesaditi chenna antarbhavat** II.3.53 (269)

If it be said (that the distinction of pleasure and pain etc.,
results) from (the difference of) place, (we say) not so, on
account of the self being in all bodies.

**Pradesat:** on account of particular locality or environment, from
(difference of) place; **Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not so, the argument
cannot stand; **Antarbhavat:** on account of the self being in all bodies.

An ob jec tion to Su tra 52 is raised and re futed. This Su tra con -
sists of two parts, viz., an ob jec tion and its re ply. The ob jec tion por tion
is ‘ _Pradesaditi chet_ ’ and the re ply por tion is ‘ _Na antarbhavat_ .’
The Naiyayikas and oth ers try to get over the dif fi culty shown in
the pre vi ous Su tra by giv ing the fol low ing ar gu ment. Though each
soul is all-per vad ing, yet, con fu sion of re sults of ac tions will not oc cur
if we take its con nec tion with the mind to take place in that part of it
which is lim ited by its body.
Even this can not stand. This also is not pos si ble on ac count of
its be ing within all. Be cause, as be ing equally in fi nite all selfs are
within all bod ies. Ev ery soul is all-per vad ing and there fore per me ates
all bod ies. There is noth ing to fix that a par tic u lar body be longs to a
par tic u lar soul.
More over, on ac count of the doc trine of lim i ta tion due to dif fer -
ence of place, it would fol low that some times two selfs en joy ing the
same plea sure or pain may ef fect their fru ition by one and the same
way, as it may hap pen that the un seen prin ci ple of two selfs oc cu pies
the same place.
Fur ther, from the doc trine that the un seen prin ci ples oc cupy
fixed places it would fol low that no en joy ment of heaven can take
place, be cause the Adrishta is ef fected in def i nite places such as,
e.g., the body of a Brahmana and the en joy ment of heaven is bound
to a def i nite dif fer ent place.
There can not be more than one all-per vad ing en tity. If there
were many all-per vad ing en ti ties they would limit each other and
there fore cease to be all-per vad ing or in fi nite.
There fore there is only one At man and not many. The Vedanta
doc trine of one At man is the only fault less doc trine. The only doc trine
not open to any ob jec tions is the doc trine of the unity of the self. The
plu ral ity of selfs in Vedanta is only a prod uct of Avidya, ne science or
ig no rance and not a re al ity.

INTRODUCTION
```
In the Third Pada or Sec tion it has been shown that ether and
other el e ments are pro duced from Brah man by rec on cil ing the ap par -
ently con tra dic tory texts of the Srutis that treat of their or i gin. It has
been shown that a con flict of the Ve dic pas sages as to the orig i na tion
of the ether, etc., does not ex ist. The same is now done in this Sec tion
with re gard to the vi tal airs or Pranas, and senses. The texts that deal
with the or i gin of the Pranas and senses are taken up for dis cus sion.
This Sec tion es tab lishes that the vi tal airs and the senses de rive their
or i gin from Brah man.

**SYNOPSIS**
This Sec tion (Pada) IV of Chap ter II is de voted to the dis cus sion
of the cre ation of the senses, the chief Prana. It es tab lishes that they
orig i nate from Brah man.
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-4) teaches that the Pranas (senses)
orig i nate from Brah man.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Sutras 5-6) de clares that the senses are eleven
in num ber.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Su tra 7) teaches that the senses are of min ute
size (Anu) and not all-per vad ing.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Su tra 8) in ti mates that the chief Prana is also
pro duced from Brah man.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 9-12) informs us that the chief Prana is a
prin ci ple dis tinct from air in gen eral and from Pranas (senses) dis -
cussed above.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Su tra 13) teaches that the chief Prana is min ute
(Anu) and not all-per vad ing.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 14-16) teaches that the or gans are su -
per in tended and guided in their ac tions by spe cial de i ties. The senses
are con nected per ma nently with and are sub ser vi ent to the in di vid ual
soul. Hence the in di vid ual soul and not the pre sid ing de i ties is their
mas ter.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Sutras 17-19) informs us that or gans are in de -
pend ent prin ci ples and not mere modes of func tions of the chief
Prana. Prana is not the re sul tant of the com bined func tions of all the
eleven senses. Al though Prana is dif fer ent from the senses and
there fore not in cluded in their num ber of eleven, yet it is like them, an
in stru ment of ac tion, as it has a spe cific and ex traor di nary func tion of
sup port ing and nour ish ing the body, sus tain ing life, and sup port ing
the senses.
_Adhikarana IX:_ (Sutras 20-22) de clares that the cre ation of
names and forms (the Namarupavyakarana) is the work not of the in -
di vid ual soul but of the Lord.
Flesh orig i nates from earth. So also is the case of the two other
el e ments (fire and wa ter).
On ac count of pre pon der ance of a par tic u lar el e ment in them
the gross el e ments are so named af ter it. As for in stance, the gross
wa ter is pro duced from the mix ture of all the five pri mary el e ments but
as the share con sti tuted by the el e ment wa ter pre pon der ates in the
com po si tion of the gross wa ter, it is named wa ter.

Pranotpattyadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-4)
The Pranas have their origin from Brahman
```
**VWm àmUm...Ÿ&**

**Tatha pranah** II.4.1 (270)

Thus the vital airs (are produced from Brahman).

**Tatha:** thus, likewise, similarly, like the creation of the five primal

elements as stated in the previous section; **Pranah:** the Pranas, the

organs.

The cre ation of the Pranas or senses is now de scribed.
The Pranas are di vided into two classes, namely Pranas in a
strict sense and Pranas in a met a phor i cal sense. The eleven senses,
sight, hear ing, etc., are called Pranas in a sec ond ary mean ing. The
five Pranas, Prana, Apana, Vyana, Samana and Udana are the prin ci -
pal Pranas. Among these, the au thor first takes up the eleven senses
which are called Pranas in a sec ond ary sense.
Purvapakshin: The Pranas have no or i gin for they are eter nal
like the Jivas and ex isted even be fore cre ation.
Siddhantin: The Pranas have or i gin.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: The chap ters which
treat of the or i gin of things do not re cord an or i gin of the vi tal airs, e.g.,
“It sent forth fire”, etc., (Chh. Up. VI.2.3). “From that Self sprang
ether”, etc., (Tait. Up. II.1). It is said clearly in some places that the vi -
tal airs were not pro duced. “This was in deed non-ex is tence in the be -
gin ning. They say what was that non-be ing? Those Rishis in deed
were the non-be ing in the be gin ning. They say who are those Rishis?
The Pranas (or gans) are in deed the Rishis” (Sat. Br. VI.1.1.1). This
shows that the Pranas (or gans) are eter nal and not cre ated.
This Su tra re futes the above view and says that the Pranas are
pro duced just like ether from Brah man. The word ‘Tatha (thus or like -
wise)’ does not re fer to the pre ced ing topic of the last sec tion which is
the plu ral ity of souls but to the cre ation of ether, etc., treated in the last
sec tion. Sruti texts di rectly de clare their orig i na tion. “From that (Brah -
man) are pro duced the vi tal air, mind and all the or gans” (Mun. Up.
II.1.3). “As small sparks come forth from fire, thus do all vi tal airs
come forth from that Brah man” (Bri. Up. II.1.20). “The seven vi tal airs
also spring from Him” (Mun. Up. II.1.8). “He sent forth the vi tal air;
from the vi tal air, Sraddha, ether, air, light, wa ter, earth, sense, mind,
food” (Pras. Up. VI.4).
There fore, the senses are cre ated.
If the cre ation of the Prana is not stated in some places,
that will not lessen the force of the pas sages about such cre ation. “ _Na
hi kvachidasravanamanyatra srutam nivarayitumutsahate_ ”;
“ _Tattejo’srijat_ ”; “ _Etasmajjayate Pranah_ ”.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 286
```

The cir cum stance of a thing not be ing stated in some places has
no power to in val i date what is stated about it in other places.
There fore, an ac count of equal ity of scrip tural state ments, it is
proper to main tain that the Pranas also are pro duced in the same way
as ether and so on.

**Jm¡Ê`gå^dmV²Ÿ&**

**Gaunyasambhavat** II.4.2 (271)
On account of the impossibility of a secondary (origin of the
Pranas).

**Gauni:** secondary sense; **Asambhavat:** on account of impossibility,
as it is impossible, being impossible.

A plau si ble ob jec tion to Su tra 1 is re futed.
The Purvapakshin says: The Satapatha Brahmana speaks of
the ex is tence of the Pranas (or gans) be fore cre ation. The texts which
de scribe their cre ation speak in a sec ond ary sense only.
This Su tra re futes it. The state ment as to the or i gin of the
Pranas can not be taken in a sec ond ary sense be cause there from the
aban don ment of a gen eral as ser tion would re sult. “By the knowl edge
of one, ev ery thing else is known.” “What is that through which when it
is known ev ery thing else be comes known?” (Mun. Up. I.1.3). There -
fore the Pranas are pro duced from Brah man.
The cre ation of ev ery thing from Brah man has been re it er ated in
Sruti. There is no Sruti which con tra dicts it. _“Yato va imani bhutani
jayante_ —from which orig i nate all these things” (Tait. Bhriguvalli I). In
the face of the ex press state ment in Srutis that all things are cre ated
from Brah man, it is ab surd to sup pose the Pranas (senses) are the
sole ex cep tions.
The ref er ence to the ex is tence of the Pranas (or gans) be fore
cre ation in the Satapatha Brahmana per tains to Hiranyagarbha.
Hiranyagarbha is Cos mic Prana. It is not re solved in par tial dis so lu -
tion of the uni verse. Even Hiranyagarbha is re solved in com plete dis -
so lu tion (Mahapralaya).

**VËàmH²$N®>VoüŸ&**

**Tatprakcchrutescha** II.4.3 (272)
On account of that (word which indicates origin) being
mentioned first (in connection with Pranas).

**Tat:** that; **Prak:** first; **Sruteh:** from Sruti, on account of the Sruti text
being mentioned; **Cha:** and, also.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 2 is given.
A fur ther rea son is given in this Su tra to in di cate that the Pranas
(or gans) have taken their or i gin from Brah man.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 4 287
```

Fur ther, be cause of the use of the word ‘Jayate’ (is born) in re -
spect of Pranas ex ist ing prior to Akasa or ether, etc., it is clear that the
Pranas (or gans) have orig i nated from Brah man.
The scrip tural state ment about the or i gin of the Pranas is to be
taken in its lit eral or pri mary sense only. The text re ferred to is “From
that (Brah man) are pro duced the Prana (vi tal air), mind and all the or -
gans, ether, air, wa ter, fire and earth.” (Mun. Up. II.1.3). Here the word
‘Jayate’ (is born) oc curs at the very be gin ning of the things enu mer -
ated. If the word is in ter preted in its pri mary sense with ref er ence to
ether, etc., it must be all the more so in ter preted with ref er ence to the
Pranas, mind and or gans which are men tioned ear lier.
The sec ond ary sense is not ac cept able be cause the Sruti
places the Pranas (or gans) prior to Akasa, air, etc. The word (Jayate)
oc curs first, then the words sig ni fy ing Prana and the senses, and, last
of all, come Akasa, air, etc. Now that the word ‘Jayate’ is ac cepted in
its pri mary sense with re spect to Akasa, etc., why should it be taken in
a sec ond ary sense, in con nec tion with Pranas (or gans) which the
Sruti has placed prior to Akasa, etc.?
It would be ab surd to de cide that a word enu mer ated once only
in one chap ter and one sen tence and con nected with many other
words, has in some cases to be taken in its pri mary sense and oth ers
in a sec ond ary sense, be cause such a de ci sion would im ply want of
uni for mity. The word ‘Jayate’ which co mes in the end must be con -
nected with the Pranas, etc., men tioned in the ear lier part of the sen -
tence.

**VËnyd©H$ËdmÛmM...Ÿ&**

**Tatpurvakatvadvachah** II.4.4 (273)

Because speech is preceded by that, (viz., fire and the other
elements).

**Tatpurvakatvat:** being preceded by them (the elements); **Vachah:** of
the organ of speech.

An other ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 2 is given.
The Chhandogya Upanishad de clares “For, truly, my child, mind
con sists of earth (i.e., food), Prana of wa ter, Vak of speech of fire”
(VI.5.4). This text clearly in di cates that the or gans, etc., are prod ucts
of the el e ments. The el e ments in their turn orig i nate from Brah man.
There fore the or gans (Pranas) are also prod ucts of Brah man. As the
Pranas (or gans) are the prod ucts of the el e ments, they are not sep a -
rately men tioned in the Sruti pas sages which treat of the or i gin of
things.
By the state ment in the Sruti of the di rect cau sa tion of the el e -
ments it is sug gested that the Pranas (senses) have Brah man for
their im me di ate cause.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 288
```

More over, the pas sage con cludes by say ing that the en tire
world is the cre ation of Brah man, and is the form of Brah man and is
ensouled by Brah man.
There fore it is an es tab lished con clu sion that the Pranas also
are ef fects of Brah man. The Pranas (or gans) have an or i gin just like
the el e ments ether, etc., and are not eter nal.

```
Saptagatyadhikaranam: Topic 2 (Sutras 5-6)
The number of the organs
```
**gá JVo{d©eo{fVËdmƒŸ&**

**Sapta gaterviseshitatvaccha** II.4.5 (274)

The Pranas (organs) are seven on account of this being
understood (from scriptural passages) and of the specification
(of those seven).

**Sapta:** seven; **Gateh:** from the movement, being so known (from the
scriptural passages); **Viseshitatvat:** on account of the specification;
**Cha:** and.

The num ber of the Pranas (senses) is now dis cussed.
The num ber of the or gans is as cer tained in this and the next Su -
tra. A doubt arises here ow ing to the con flict ing na ture of the scrip tural
pas sages. In one place seven Pranas are men tioned “The seven
Pranas (or gans) spring from Him” (Mun. Up. II.1.8). In an other place
eight Pranas are men tioned as be ing Grahas “Eight Grahas there are
and eight Atigrahas” (Bri. Up. III.2.1). In an other place nine “Seven
are the Pranas of the head, two the lower ones” (Tait. Samhita
V.3.2.5). Some times ten “Nine Pranas in deed are in man, the na vel is
the tenth” (Tait. Samhita V.3.2.3). Some times eleven “Ten are these
Pranas in man, and At man is the elev enth” (Bri. Up. III.9.4). Some -
times twelve “All touches have their cen tre in the skin” (Bri. Up.
II.4.11). Some times thir teen “The eye and what can be seen” (Prasna
Up. IV.8). Thus the scrip tural pas sages dis agree about the num ber of
the Pranas (or gans).
This Su tra gives the view of the Purvapakshin or the op po nent.
Here the Purvapakshin main tains that the Pranas are in re al ity seven
in num ber, be cause it is stated to be so in some scrip tural texts such
as “The seven Pranas (or gans) sprang from Him” (Mun. Up. II.1.8).
These seven Pranas are more over spec i fied in Tait. Samhita V.1.7.1,
“Seven in deed are the Pranas in the head.”
Eight or nine or gans are enu mer ated in some texts but these are
only mod i fi ca tions of the in ner or gan. Hence there is no con tra dic tion
in the Sruti texts if we take the num ber as seven.
To this ar gu men ta tion of the Purvapakshin the next Su tra gives
a suit able re ply.

**Hastadayastu sthite’to naivam** II.4.6 (275)

But (there are also in addition to the seven Pranas mentioned)

the hands and rest. This being a settled matter, therefore (we

must) not (conclude) thus (viz., that there are seven Pranas

only).

**Hastadayah:** hands and the rest; **Tu:** but; **Sthite:** being determined,

being a fact, while abiding in the body; **Atah:** therefore; **Na:** not;
**Evam:** thus, so, like this.

Su tra 5 is re futed and the ac tual num ber of the Pranas (senses)
is as cer tained.
The word ‘tu’ (but) re futes the view of the pre vi ous Su tra. Su tra 6
is the Siddhanta Su tra.
The num ber seven is not cor rect.
In ad di tion to the seven Pranas scrip ture men tions other Pranas
also, such as the hands, etc. “The hand is one Graha (or gan) and that
is seized by work as the Atigraha; for with the hands one does work”
(Bri. Up. III.2.8), and sim i lar pas sages, “ten are the senses in a man
and mind with these com pletes the num ber eleven” (Bri. Up. III.9.4),
in di cate that the hands etc., are ad di tional or gans. There fore, four
other or gans viz., hands, feet, anus and the or gan of gen er a tion have
to be added to the seven or gans al ready men tioned, viz., eyes, nose,
ears, tongue, touch (skin), speech, and mind, the in ner or gan. The in -
tel lect, ego ism, Chitta or mem ory are not sep a rate or gans. They are
only mod i fi ca tions of the mind.
There fore, the num ber of or gans is in all eleven. This is the num -
ber that is fixed. They are, the five or gans of knowl edge
(Jnana-Indriyas), the five or gans of ac tion (Karma-Indriyas) and the
in ner or gan, mind.
To unite all the di verse ac tiv i ties of the or gans, it is nec es sary
that there should be an or gan which must ex ist as a uni fy ing agent
with the mem ory of the past and the pres ent to gether with the an tic i -
pa tion of the fu ture, be cause with out such an or gan the ac tiv i ties of
the or gans would be unharmonised and dis cor dant. This uni fy ing or -
gan is the in ner or gan or the Manas (mind). This one in ner or gan as -
sumes four names such as mind, in tel lect, ego ism and Chitta,
ac cord ing to the func tions it per forms (Vrittibheda).
In the pas sage “Nine Pranas in deed are in man, the na vel is the
tenth”, the ex pres sion “ten Pranas” is used to de note the dif fer ent
open ings of the hu man body, not the dif fer ence of na ture of the
Pranas. Be cause no Prana is known that bears the name of na vel. As
the na vel is one of the spe cial abodes of the chief Prana, it is here
enu mer ated as tenth Prana.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 290
```

There are only eleven Pranas. This con clu sion is con firmed by
one of the scrip tural pas sages, “Ten are these Pranas in man and At -
man is the elev enth.” By the word At man we have to un der stand the
in ter nal or gan on ac count of its rul ing over the or gans.

Prananutvadhikaranam: Topic 3
The organs are minute in size
```
**AUdüŸ&**

**Anavascha** II.4.7 (276)
And (they are) minute.

**Anavah:** minute; **Cha:** and, also.

The na ture and size of senses is now as cer tained.
The au thor now con sid ers the ques tion of the na ture and size of
the senses. Are these senses all-per vad ing or are they min ute? The
Purvapakshin says that the senses are all-per vad ing, be cause we
can hear sounds at a dis tance and see ob jects far off. The Siddhanta
view how ever is that senses are atomic.
The word ‘cha’ has the force of cer tainty. It means that the
senses are not all-per vad ing but atomic. This Su tra re futes the doc -
trine of the Sankhyas who main tain that the senses are all-per vad ing.
The or gans are min ute. Min ute does not mean atomic, but sub -
tle and lim ited in size.
The or gans must be sub tle; for, if they are gross we could see
them when they go out of the body at the mo ment of death, as a snake
co mes out of its hole. Had they been all-per vad ing like the ether, there
would have been no move ment pos si ble on their part, and the texts
which speak of their pass ing out of body and go ing and com ing along
with the soul at death and birth would be con tra dicted. The soul can -
not have them as his es sence.
It can not be said that even if they are all-per vad ing they can
have a par tic u lar mode or func tion within the body, be cause it is that
par tic u lar mode or func tion which we call the sense or the in stru ment.
More over, we do not per ceive through the senses what is hap pen ing
through out the world. If they were all-per vad ing we will cer tainly per -
ceive through them what is hap pen ing through out the world.
There fore the senses are all sub tle and fi nite, i.e., of lim ited size.

Pranasraishthyadhikaranam: Topic 4
The chief Prana has also an origin from Brahman
```
**loîR>üŸ&**

**Sreshthascha** II.4.8 (277)

And the best (i.e., the chief vital air or Prana is also produced).

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 4 291
```

**Sreshthah:** the best, the highest, the chief Prana (vital force or

life-energy); **Cha:** and, also.

The chief Prana is be ing char ac ter ised now.
The chief Prana has also an or i gin. It is an ef fect of Brah man.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: “From this (Brah man)
is pro duced the vi tal force or Prana” (Mun. Up. II.1.3). Again we have
“By its own law the one was breath ing with out wind; there was noth ing
dif fer ent from that or higher than that” (Rig Veda VIII.7.17). Here the
words ‘was breath ing’ which de note the proper func tion of breath
show that breath or Prana must have ex isted be fore the cre ation.
There fore, it may be con cluded that Prana was not cre ated. There
seems to be a con tra dic tion with ref er ence to its orig i na tion.
This Su tra re futes the above view and de clares that even the
chief Prana is pro duced from Brah man.
The words “was breath ing” are qual i fied by the ad di tion “with out
wind” and so do not in ti mate that Prana ex isted be fore cre ation.
More over scrip tural pas sages such as “He is with out breath,
with out mind, pure” (Mun. Up. II.1.2) de clare clearly that Brah man is
with out any qual i fi ca tions such as Prana and so on. There fore the
words “was breath ing” have merely the pur pose of stat ing the ex is -
tence of the cause. They in ti mate that Brah man, the cause ex isted
be fore cre ation as is known from the texts like “Ex is tence alone was
there be fore this” (Chh. Up. VI.2.1).
In the Sruti pas sage “Anidavatam”, the word ‘avata’ shows that
what is re ferred to is some thing which is an te rior to Prana. Anit, there -
fore re fers to Brah man.
The term “the best” de notes the chief vi tal air (Mukhya Prana)
ac cord ing to the dec la ra tion of scrip ture, “Breath in deed is the old est
and the best” (Chh. Up. V.1.1). The breath is the old est or the chief be -
cause it be gins its func tion from the mo ment when the child is con -
ceived. The senses of hear ing, etc., be gin to func tion only when their
spe cial seats, viz., the ears, etc., are formed. They are, there fore, not
the old est. It is called the old est or the chief on ac count of its su pe rior
qual i ties and on ac count of the pas sage “We shall not be able to live
with out thee” (Bri. Up. VI.1.13). The chief Prana is called the best, be -
cause it is the cause of the main te nance of the body.

```
Vayukriyadhikaranam: Topic 5 (Sutras 9-12)
The chief Prana is different from air and sense functions
```
**Z dm`w{H«$`o n¥WJwnXoemV²Ÿ&**

Na vayukriye prithagupadesat II.4.9 (278)
(The chief Prana is) neither air nor function, on account of its
being mentioned separately.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 292
```

**Na:** not; **Vayukriye:** air or function; **Prithak:** separate, separately;

**Upadesat:** because of the teaching, on account of its being

mentioned. ( **Prithagupadesat:** because of the separate mention.)

The na ture of the chief Prana is dis cussed in this Su tra.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains that there is no
sep a rate prin ci ple called Prana, and that the Prana is ac cord ing to
Sruti noth ing but air. For Sruti says, “Breath is air”; that air as sum ing
five forms is Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana, Samana. Or it may be
con sid ered as the com bined func tion of all or gans. Just as eleven
birds shut up in one cage may move the cage by the com bi na tion of
their ef forts, so also the eleven Pranas which abide in one body func -
tion ing to gether pro duce one com mon func tion called Prana. This is
the view of the Sankhyas. The Sankhyas teach “The five airs, Pranas,
etc., are the com mon func tion of the or gans (in stru ments).” There -
fore, there is no sep a rate prin ci ple called Prana.
This Su tra re futes these views and says that the Prana is nei ther
air nor func tion of or gans, for it is men tioned sep a rately from air and
the sense func tions. “Breath in deed is the fourth foot of Brah man.
That foot shines and warms as the light called air” (Chh. Up. III.18.4).
Here it is dis tin guished from air. Each sense and its func tion are iden -
ti cal.
Again, other pas sages also, in which the Prana is men tioned
sep a rately from air and the or gans are here to be con sid ered, e.g.,
“From Him is born the Prana, mind and all or gans of sense, ether, air,
etc.” (Mun. Up. II.1.3). This in di cates that Prana is not a func tion of
any or gan be cause, in that case, it would not have been sep a rated
from the or gans.
It is not pos si ble that all the or gans to gether should have one
func tion and that that func tion should be the Prana, be cause each or -
gan has its own spe cial func tion and the ag gre gate of them has no ac -
tive power of its own. Prana can not be said to be the re sul tant of the
joint func tion ing of the senses, as the func tions are di verse.
The pas sage “Breath (Prana) is air” is also cor rect, be cause the
ef fect is only the cause in an other form. The Prana is only air that
func tions within the body. The air pass ing into the Adhyatma state, di -
vid ing it self five fold and thus abid ing in a spe cial ised con di tion is
called Prana.
The anal ogy of the birds in a cage is not to the point, be cause
they all have the same kind of ac tiv ity which is fa vour able to the mo -
tion of the cage. But the func tion ing of the senses are not of one kind
but dif fer ent from one an other. They are also of a dis tinct na ture from
that of Prana. Prana is quite dis sim i lar to hear ing, etc. Hence, they
(the or gans) can not con sti tute life. There fore, Prana is a sep a rate
entity.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 4 293
```

More over, if the vi tal breath were the mere func tion of or gans it
could not be glo ri fied as the ‘best’ and speech, etc., could not be rep -
re sented as sub or di nate to Prana. Hence the Prana is dif fer ent from
air and the func tions of the or gans.

**Mjwam{XdÎmw VËgh{eîQ>çm{Xä`...Ÿ&**

**Chakshuradivattu tatsahasishtyadibhyah** II.4.10 (278)

But (the Prana is subordinate to the soul), like eyes, etc., on
account of (its) being taught with them (the eyes, etc.) and for
other reasons.

**Chakshuradivat:** like the eyes and the rest; **Tu:** but; **Tatsaha:** along
with them; **Sishtyadibhyah:** on account of (its) being taught,
because of the scriptural instructions and other reasons.

The char ac ter is tics of Prana are con tin ued.
The Purvapakshin says: The Prana also must be con sid ered to
be in de pend ent in this body like the in di vid ual soul, as scrip ture de -
clares it to be the best and the or gans such as speech, etc., to be sub -
or di nate to it. Var i ous pow ers are at trib uted to it in scrip tural
pas sages. It is said that when speech and the other or gans are
asleep the Prana alone is awake; that the Prana alone is not reached
by death; that the Prana is the ab sorber, it ab sorbs speech, etc., that
the Prana guards the other senses (Pranas) as a mother guards her
sons. Hence it fol lows that the Prana is in de pend ent like the in di vid ual
soul.
This Su tra re futes this and says that the Prana is sub or di nate to
the soul.
The words ‘tu’ (but) sets aside the in de pend ence of the Prana. It
re moves the doubt.
The word ‘Adi’ etc., in di cates that the word ‘Prana’ is also used
in the sense of sense or gans. The Prana is enu mer ated along with
the senses in or der to in di cate that it is not in de pend ent.
The Prana sub serves the soul like the senses, be cause it is de -
scribed with them. The chief Prana is not in de pend ent of the Jiva, but
is, like the senses, a means of his be ing Karta (doer) and Bhokta
(enjoyer). The soul is the King. Prana is his min is ter. The senses are
his sub jects. Prana is de scribed along with the senses. It abides in the
body like the senses. Fur ther, it is Achetana (non-sen tient) like them.
It is com posed of parts. These are the other rea sons for re fut ing the
in de pend ence of Prana. There fore it de pends on the soul and serves
the soul like the senses.
Prana is like the eyes, etc., one of the tools or in stru ments of the
in di vid ual soul though it stands fore most among them, be cause it is
placed in the same cat e gory with the eye and the other senses in a
mu tual con ver sa tion amongst them de scribed in the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad VI.1.7-14. Things hav ing sim i lar at trib utes are al ways

grouped and taught to gether, e.g., the Brihatsaman and the
Rathantarasaman. Hence it is sub or di nate to the soul.

**AH$aUËdmƒ Z XmofñVWm {h Xe©`{VŸ&**

**Akaranatvaccha na doshastatha hi darsayati** II.4.11 (280)
And on account of (its) not being an instrument the objection is

**Akaranatvat:** on account of (its) not being an instrument; **Cha:** and,
also; **Na:** not; **Doshah:** defect, objection, fault; **Tatha:** thus, so; **Hi:**
as, because; **Darsayati:** teaches, scripture shows, declares.

An ob jec tion against Su tra 10 is re futed.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: if the Prana is sub or di -
nate to the soul like the or gans, then it must stand in the re la tion of an
in stru ment to the soul like the or gans. We must as sume an other
sense-ob ject anal o gous to col our. But there is no twelfth sense-ob -
ject. There are only eleven func tions and eleven or gans. There is no
room for a twelfth or gan when there is no twelfth sense-ob ject.
The word ‘Cha’ (and) has the force of ‘but’ here, and is used to
re move the doubt raised above.
This Su tra re futes the above ob jec tion. Prana is not an in stru -
ment. Scrip ture de clares that the chief Prana has a spe cific func tion
which can not be long to the other or gans. The body and all the senses
sub sist by means of the chief Prana. The scrip tural pas sages say:
“Then Prana as the best said to the or gans: Be not de ceived. I alone,
di vid ing my self five-fold, sup port this body and keep it” (Pras. Up.
II.3). An other pas sage, viz., “With Prana guard ing the lower nest” (Bri.
Up. IV.3.12), shows that the guard ing of the body de pends upon the
Prana.
Again, two other pas sages show that the nour ish ing of the body
de pends on Prana “From what ever limb Prana goes away that limb
with ers” (Bri. Up. I.3.19). “What we eat and drink, with it sup ports the
other or gans” (Bri. Up. 1.3.18). And an other pas sage de clares that
the soul’s de part ing and stay ing de pends on Prana. “What is it by
whose de par ture I shall de part, and by whose stay ing I shall
stay?—the cre ated Prana” (Pras. Up. VI.3-4).
All these texts show that the func tion of the Prana is nour ish ing
and up keep of the body. Prana pro tects the body from dis so lu tion.
The strength of the body and the senses also de pends upon Prana.
Prana sup ports the body and energises it with all the senses. This is
its spe cific func tion.
Prana is of the great est help to the soul by be ing the sup port of
all other senses. Not only does it sup port the senses but it is the or -
gan is ing life of the body and hence of the great est im por tance to the
Jiva or the in di vid ual soul.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 4 295
```

Prana has no func tion like the or di nary sense. There fore it can -
not be styled as Indriya or or gan. Hence it is ex cluded from the list of
eleven senses.
The chief Prana is also an in stru ment of the soul. The senses
like the eye, ear, etc., are as if of fi cials of the Jiva and help him in his
en joy ment and ac tiv ity but the chief Prana is his prime min is ter. It as -
sists him in his high est func tions and in the at tain ment of all his de -
sires.
This is not the only func tion of Prana. There are other func tions
also. The next Su tra de scribes the other func tions.

**n#md¥{Îm_©ZmodX² ì`n{Xí`VoŸ&**

**Panchavrittirmanovat vyapadisyate** II.4.12 (281)
It is taught as having a fivefold function like the mind.

**Panchavrittih:** having fivefold function; **Manovat:** like the mind;
**Vyapadisyate:** is described, it is taught, it is designated.

The de scrip tion of the char ac ter is tics of the chief Prana is con -
tin ued.
Prasna Upanishad (II.3) de clares “I alone, di vid ing my self five -
fold, sup port this body and pro tect it.”
Just as the mind in re la tion to the five senses has five modes,
even so Prana has five modes, viz., Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana and
Samana. Prana does the func tion of res pi ra tion; Apana, evac u a tion;
Samana, di ges tion, as sim i la tion of food; Vyana, cir cu la tion of blood
(aid ing feats of strength); and Udana, deglutition. Udana helps the
soul to pass out of the body at the time of death. In this re spect Prana
re sem bles the in ner or gan which though one has a five-fold as pect as
mind, in tel lect, ego, Chitta and mem ory.
Just as the mind be ing en dowed with sev eral func tions such as
de sire, con tem pla tion, faith, vo li tion, feel ing, know ing, etc., serves the
in di vid ual soul, so also the chief Prana does good to the in di vid ual
soul be ing vested with the five func tions.
The func tions of the mind, ac cord ing to Raja Yoga of Patanjali
Maharshi, are right knowl edge, er ror, imag i na tion, slum ber and re -
mem brance. Or the Su tra may quote the means as an anal o gous in -
stance merely with ref er ence to the plu ral ity and not the five-foldness
of its func tions.
The Prana’s sub or di nate po si tion with re gard to the soul fol lows
from its hav ing five func tions like the mind.

The de scrip tion of the char ac ter is tics of the chief Prana is con -
tin ued.
The chief Prana is also min ute like the senses. Here also we
have to un der stand by mi nute ness that the chief Prana is sub tle and
of lim ited size, not that it is of atomic size, be cause by means of its five
func tions it per vades the whole body.
Prana is sub tle be cause it can not be seen when it goes out of
the body. It is lim ited or fi nite, be cause the scrip ture speaks of its
pass ing out, go ing and com ing. Had it been all-per vad ing, there could
have been no move ment on its part.
There fore Prana is also fi nite or lim ited.
It may be ob jected that it is all-per vad ing ac cord ing to the text
“He is equal to a gnat, equal to a mos quito, equal to an el e phant,
equal to these three worlds, equal to this uni verse” (Bri. Up. I.3.22).
But the all-pervadingness of which this text speaks is with re spect to
Hiranyagarbha, the cos mic Prana, the Prana of the mac ro cosm. It is
all-per vad ing in its uni ver sal as pect; in its in di vid ual as pect it is lim -
ited.
The state ments of equal ity “equal to a gnat”, etc., de clare the
lim ited size of the Prana which abides within ev ery liv ing be ing.

**Jyotiradyadhishthanam:** presiding over by Fire and others; **Tu:** but;

Now fol lows a dis cus sion on the de pend ence of the or gans or
the pre sid ing de i ties.
The Purvapakshin holds that the Pranas (senses) act from their
own power. If we ad mit that the Pranas act only un der the guid ance of
the pre sid ing de i ties, it would fol low that those guid ing de i ties are
enjoyers of the fruits of the ac tions and the in di vid ual soul would thus
cease to be the enjoyer.
The word ‘tu’ (but) is used in or der to re move the doubt. It ex -
cludes the Purvapaksha.
The Pranas and senses func tion not be cause of their own po -
tency but be cause of the power of the de i ties pre sid ing over them.

```
CHAPTER II—SECTION 4 297
```

Pranas, i.e., the senses, are un der the guid ance of the de i ties
such as Fire and oth ers pre sid ing over them. Sruti also states so.
Aitareya Aranyaka (I.2.4) de clares, “Fire hav ing be come speech en -
tered the mouth.” The senses are in ert. They can not move by them -
selves.
The as ser tion that the Pranas be ing en dowed with the ca pa bil ity
of pro duc ing their ef fects act from their own power is un founded, as
we see that some things which pos sess the ca pa bil ity of mo tion such
as cars ac tu ally move only if dragged by bulls and the like.
There fore the Pranas and the senses are de pend ent on the pre -
sid ing de i ties.

**àmUdVm eãXmV²Ÿ&**

**Pranavata sabdat** II.4.15 (284)

(The gods are not the enjoyers, but the soul, because the
organs are connected) with the one (i.e., the soul) possessing
them (a thing we know) from the scriptures.

**Pranavata:** with the one possessing the Pranas (organs); **Sabdat:**
from the scriptures.

From the pre ced ing Su tra a doubt may arise, that the gods, who
guide the senses may be the enjoyers; this doubt is re moved by this
Su tra.
‘Prana’ here is a syn onym for Indriya or sense.
The senses are con nected with the soul. This is de scribed by
the Sruti. Though the gods guide the senses, though they are the pre -
sid ing de i ties of the or gans, they can not be come Bhoktas or enjoyers.
The in di vid ual soul is the mas ter. The senses are his ser vants. The
senses func tion for sub serv ing the in ter est of the soul. The in di vid ual
soul is the Lord of the ag gre gate of the in stru ments of ac tion. The Jiva
alone real ises that he sees, hears, etc.

```
The scrip tures de clare “Then where there is the eye, en ter ing
```
this open ing—the cav ity of the eye—it is there to serve the in di vid ual
soul, the eye it self is the in stru ment of see ing.” “He who knows ‘Let

me smell this’ he is the Self, the nose is the in stru ment of smell ing”
(Chh. Up. VIII.12.4) This clearly shows that the soul is the enjoyer but

not the gods. The or gans are con nected with the in di vid ual soul only.
The in di vid ual soul claims and feels the eye to be his own. The
eye is to serve him by pre sent ing him with the ob jects of sight. Sim i -
larly the other senses also are the ser vants of the same mas ter, the
in di vid ual soul. Hence the in di vid ual soul and not the pre sid ing de i ties
is the mas ter or Lord of the senses and the real enjoyer.
The soul is called Pranavat be cause the Pranas (or gans) be -
long to it. The soul rules the senses in or der to ac com plish its ob jects
of en joy ment. The gods rule the senses by merely giv ing their ac tiv i -

ties. The in di vid ual soul rules the senses in or der to en joy plea sur able

ex pe ri ences.
More over there are many gods in the body. A par tic u lar or gan is

pre sided over by a par tic u lar de ity. The plu ral ity of gods guid ing the

or gans ren ders it im pos si ble that they should be enjoyers in their

body. There is and can be only one Bhokta or enjoyer. Oth er wise re -

mem brance or rec og ni tion of iden tity would be im pos si ble.
There fore the senses are for the en joy ment of the soul and not

the gods though they are pre sided and di rected by them.

him; ver ily evil does not ap proach the Devas” (Bri. Up. I.5.20).
The or gans are per ma nently con nected with the em bod ied soul

only. When the soul passes out, the Pranas (or gans) fol low it. This we

see from pas sages such as the fol low ing “When the soul passes out,

the Prana fol lows; when the Prana de parts, all other or gans fol low”

(Bri. Up. IV.4.2).
The soul is the mas ter and is there fore the enjoyer, al though

there are pre sid ing gods over the or gans. The gods are con nected

with the or gans only, not with the state of the soul as enjoyer.

**Ta Indriyani tadvyapadesadanyatra sreshthat** II.4.17 (286)

They (the other Pranas) are senses, on account of being so
designated (by the scriptures), with the exception of the best
(the chief Prana).

**Ta:** they; **Indriyani:** the organs; **Tadvyapadesat** : because
designated as such; **Sreshthat anyatra:** except the chief, other than
the chief Prana which is the highest. ( **Anyatra:** elsewhere, except;
**Sreshthat:** than the best or the chief Prana.)

The dis tinc tion be tween the chief Prana and other Pranas (the
or gans) is now pointed out.
Now there arises an other doubt viz., whether the or gans such
as eyes, ears, etc., are func tions or modes of the chief Prana or in de -
pend ent en ti ties.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor main tains that they are mere
func tions on ac count of scrip tural state ment. The scrip ture says, “This
is the great est amongst us (the or gans). Well, let us all as sume his
form. There upon they all as sumed his form. There fore they are called
by this name of Prana” (Bri. Up. I.5.21).
The Su tra re futes this and says that the eleven or gans are not
func tions or modes of the chief Prana. They be long to a sep a rate cat -
e gory. They are shown to be dif fer ent in scrip tural pas sages like
“From Him are born Prana, mind, and all or gans” (Mun. Up. II.1.3). In
this and other pas sages Prana and the sense or gans are men tioned
sep a rately. The text of the Brihadaranyaka must be taken in a sec -
ond ary sense.
There fore it can not cer tainly be said that just as the chief Prana
has five modes the senses also are its modes, be cause the Sruti de -
scribes the senses as sep a rate. The senses are dis tinct in de pend ent
prin ci ples. The senses and the mind are de scribed as be ing eleven in
num ber.

**^oXlwVo...Ÿ&**

**Bhedasruteh** II.4.18 (287)
(On account of the) scriptural statement of difference.

**Bhedasruteh:** on account of the scriptural statement of difference.

An ar gu ment in fa vour of Su tra 17 is given.
The Prana is ev ery where spo ken of as dif fer ent from the or -
gans. In Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (I.3.2) the or gans are dealt with
in one sec tion. Af ter con clud ing it, the Prana is dealt with sep a rately in

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 300
```

the same sec tion. This clearly in di cates that they do not be long to the
same cat e gory.

Other pas sages also re fer ring to that dif fer ence may be quoted,
as for in stance, “He made mind, speech and breath for him self” (Bri.
Up. I.5.3).

In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (I.3.2) it is stated that the
gods in their strug gle with the Asuras, i.e., the evil forces found that
the senses such as the speech, the nose, the eye, the ear, and the
mind were vi ti ated by the Asuras. So they took the help of the chief
Prana. The Asuras were not able to vi ti ate the chief Prana. The gods
be came vic to ri ous over the Asuras. Here the chief Prana is spo ken of
as dif fer ent from and su pe rior to all the senses. For ref er ence vide,
“Then, the gods ap pealed to the chief Prana, the chief vi tal force
which is su pe rior to the senses” (Bri. Up. I.3.7).

There fore the or gans are in de pend ent prin ci ples, and not
modes or func tions of the chief Prana.

**d¡bjÊ`mƒŸ&**

**Vailakshanyaccha** II. 4.19 (288)

And on account of the difference of characteristics.

**Vailakshanyat:** on account of difference of characteristics; **Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in fa vour of Su tra 17 is given.
There is, more over, a dif fer ence of char ac ter is tics be tween the
chief Prana and the senses. The or gans do not func tion in deep
sleep, whereas the Prana does. The chief Prana alone is not reached
by death, while the other Pranas are. The stay ing and de part ing of the
chief Prana, not that of the sense or gans is the cause of the main te -
nance and the dis so lu tion of the body.

The sense or gans are the cause of the per cep tion of the
sense-ob jects, not the chief Prana. The or gans get tired, but not the
chief Prana. The loss of in di vid ual or gans does not cause death, but
the pass ing out of Prana causes death of the body.
Thus there are many dif fer ences dis tin guish ing the Prana from
the senses. This also in di cates that the senses are dif fer ent from the
Prana.

The Sruti which speaks, “The senses as sumed the form of
Prana”, is to be taken in a sec ond ary sense. The word ‘Prana’ is ap -
plied to the sense or gans in a sec ond ary sense. It means that their
func tion ing de pends upon Prana. It means that the or gans fol low the
Prana just as the ser vants fol low their mas ter. The chief Prana is the
ruler or the mas ter or the teacher of the or gans. The Sruti de scribes
Prana as su pe rior to the or gans (Sreshtha).

**Samjnamurtiklriptistu trivritkurvata upadesat** II.4.20 (289)

But the creation of names and forms is by Him who does the
tripartite (creation), for so the scriptures teach.

**Samjnamurtiklriptih:** the creation of name and form; **Tu:** but;
**Trivritkurvatah:** of Him who does the tripartite creation, of His who
made the elements triple; **Upadesat:** on account of scriptural
teaching, as Sruti has stated so. ( **Samjna:** name; **Murtih:** form;
**Klriptih:** creation; **Trivrit:** tripartite, compound; **Kurvatah:** of the
Creator.)

```
The Sruti de clares: “That De ity thought, let me now en ter those
```
three de i ties (fire, earth, and wa ter) with this liv ing self (Jivatma) and
let me then evolve names and forms; let me make each of these three
tri par tite” (Chh. Up. VI.3.2).
Here the doubt arises whether the agent in that evo lu tion of
names and forms is the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul or the Su preme

Lord.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains the for mer al ter -
na tive on ac count of the glo ri fi ca tion con tained in the words “with this
liv ing self.”
The word ‘tu’ (but), dis cards the Purvapaksha. This Su tra re -

futes it and says: The in di vid ual soul has not the power to cre ate the
gross world. The en tire cre ation of the world can surely be the work of
the Su preme Lord only who cre ated fire, wa ter and earth. The word

‘Jiva’ in the pas sage is syn tac ti cally re lated with ‘en trance’ and not
with the cre ation of names and forms.
That the Su preme Lord is He who evolves the names and forms
is ac knowl edged by all the Upanishads, as we see from such pas -
sages as “He who is called ether is the evolver of all names and

forms” (Chh. Up. VIII.14).
Fur ther, the next sen tence of that text, “Then that De ity said, ‘Let
me make each of these three el e ments tri par tite’ ” (Chh. Up. VI.3.3),
clearly in di cates that the Su preme Lord alone cre ates names and

forms, the gross el e ments and this uni verse.
The Lord dwells in ev ery thing and di rects the en tire cre ation. He
is the in ner di rec tor, in the pro duc tion of pots, etc., by the pot ter.

Flesh, etc., originates from earth according to the scriptural

statement and (so also) in the case of the other (elements, viz.,

fire and water).

**Mamsadi:** flesh and the rest; **Bhaumam:** are effects of earth;

**Yathasabdam:** as Sruti has said so, as declared by the scripture;

**Itarayoh:** of the other two, namely fire and water; **Cha:** also, and.

Tri par tite earth, when as sim i lated by man, forms flesh, etc. For
the text says “Food (earth) when eaten be comes three-fold; its gross -
est por tion be comes fae ces, its mid dle por tion flesh, its sub tlest por -
tion mind” (Chh. Up. VI.5.1). So also we have to learn from the text the
ef fects of the two other el e ments, viz., fire and wa ter. Out of the con -
sumed wa ter, the gross por tion goes out as urine, the me dium por tion
be comes the blood and the sub tle por tion be comes Prana. Out of the
as sim i lated fire, the gross por tion builds the bones, the me dium por -

that special name.

Su tra 21 is am pli fied here.
Here now an ob jec tion is raised. If all the gross el e ments con tain
the three fine el e ments, then why there is such dis tinc tion as “This is
fire, this is wa ter, this is earth?” And, again, why is it said that among
the el e ments of the hu man body, flesh etc., is the ef fect of the food
that is eaten; blood, etc., the ef fect of the wa ter that is drunk; bone
etc., the ef fect of the fire eaten?
The word ‘tu’ (but), re moves the ob jec tion.
This Su tra re futes the ob jec tion.
Even in each el e ment, where the other two el e ments have com -
bined, it is called so be cause it is the pre dom i nant por tion.
Al though all things are tri par tite, yet we ob serve in dif fer ent
places a pre pon der ance of dif fer ent el e ments. Heat pre pon der ates in
fire, wa ter in all that is liq uid, food in earth. As the fine el e ments are
not found in equal pro por tion in each of the gross el e ments, they are
named af ter that fine el e ment which pre pon der ates in their con sti tu -
tion.

Thus the com pound fire is called fire be cause of the pre pon der -

INTRODUCTION
```
Now in the Third Chap ter are be ing de ter mined those Sadhanas
or prac tices which are the means of at tain ing the high est Brah man or
the In fi nite. In the First and Sec ond Padas of this Chap ter are be ing
taught two things, viz., a strong yearn ing or burn ing de sire
(Mumukshutva) to real ise Brah man or the fi nal eman ci pa tion and an
equally strong dis gust (Vairagya) to wards all ob jects other than Brah -
man; be cause these are the two fun da men tal things among all
Sadhanas.
In or der to in duce Vairagya or dispassion, the Sutras show in the
first Pada the im per fec tions of all mun dane existences and this they
base on the Panchagnividya or the doc trine of five fires of the
Chhandogya Upanishad in which is taught how the soul passes af ter
death from one con di tion to an other.
The first Pada teaches the great doc trine of re in car na tion, the
de par ture of the soul from the phys i cal body, its jour ney to the
Chandraloka on the third plane and its com ing back to the earth. This
is done in or der to cre ate Vairagya or in dif fe r ence to sen sual en joy -
ments herein and here af ter. In the Sec ond Pada are de scribed all the
glo ri ous at trib utes of the Su preme Brah man, His Om ni science, Om -
nip o tence, Love li ness, etc., in or der to at tract the soul to wards Him,
so that He may be the sole ob ject of quest.

**SYNOPSIS**
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-7) teaches that the soul, at the dis so lu -
tion of the body, de parts, ac com pa nied by the sub tle ma te rial el e -
ments (Bhuta Sukshma), as well as by the Indriyas and Pranas. The
sub tle el e ments serve as an abode to the Pranas at tached to the soul.
Su tra 7: Those who do sac ri fice be come in Chandraloka the
food of the gods which means that they con trib ute to the en joy ment of
the gods by their pres ence and ser vice to them.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Sutras 8-11) shows that the souls af ter en joy ing
the fruits of their mer i to ri ous deeds in the Chandraloka de scend to the
earth with a re main der (Anusaya) of their works which de ter mines the
na ture of the new body or the char ac ter of the new life.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 12-21) dis cusses the fate af ter death of
those evil-do ers whom their evil deeds do not en ti tle to pass to the
Chandraloka.
_Adhikaranas IV, V, and VI:_ (Sutras 22; 23; and 24 to 27) teach
that the sub tle bod ies of the souls de scend ing from the Chandraloka
through the ether, air, etc., do not be come iden ti cal with ether, air,
etc., but only live there; that they de scend in a short time. On en ter ing
into a corn or a plant the soul re mains merely in con tact with it which is
al ready an i mat ed by an other soul. The soul af ter hav ing en tered into
a corn or a plant, gets con nected with him who eats the corn or fruit of
the plant and per forms the act of cop u la tion. The soul re mains with
him till he en ters into the mother’s womb with the sem i nal fluid in -
jected. The soul ul ti mately en ters the mother’s womb and is brought
forth as a child.

**Tadantarapratipattau ramhati samparishvaktah
prasnanirupanabhyam** III.1.1 ( 292 )

In order to obtain another body (the soul) goes enveloped (by
subtle elements) (as appears from) the question and
explanation (in the scripture, Chhandogya).

**Tadantarapratipattau:** for the purpose of obtaining a fresh body ( **Tat:**
that, i.e. a body; **Antara:** different, another; **Pratipattau:** in obtaining);
**Ramhati:** goes, departs, **Samparishvaktah:** enveloped (by subtle
elements); **Prasna:** from question; **Nirupanabhyam:** aid for
explanations.

In the Sec ond Chap ter all ob jec tions raised against the Vedantic
view of Brah man on the ground of Sruti and rea son ing have been re -
futed. It has been shown also that all other views are in cor rect and de -
void of foun da tion and the al leged mu tual con tra dic tions of Ve dic
texts do not ex ist. Fur ther it has been shown that all the en ti ties dif fer -
ent from the in di vi d ual soul such as Prana, etc., spring from Brah man
for the en joy ment of the soul.
In this Chap ter the man ner in which the soul trav els af ter death
to the dif fer ent re gions with its ad juncts, the dif fer ent states of the soul
and the na ture of Brah man, the sep a rate ness or non-sep a rate ness of
the Vidyas (kinds of Upasana); the ques tion whether the qual i ties of
Brah man have to be cu mu lated or not, the at tain ment of the goal by
right knowl edge (Samyagdarsana), the di ver si ties of the means of
right know l edge and the ab sence of cer tain rules as to Moksha which
is the fruit of per fect knowl edge are dis cussed to cre ate dispassion.
The Jiva (in di vid ual soul) along with the Pranas, the mind and
the senses leaves his for mer body and ob tains a new body. He takes
with him self, Avidya, vir tues and vi cious ac tions and the im pres sions
left by his pre vi ous births.
Here the ques tion arises whether the soul is en vel oped or not by
sub tle parts of the el e ments as the seed for the fu ture body in his
trans mi gra tion. The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says—It is not so
en vel oped, be cause the sub tle parts of the el e ments are eas ily avail -
able ev ery where. This Su tra re futes this view and says that the soul
does take with it sub tle parts of the el e ments which are the seeds of
the new body. How do we know this? From the ques tion and an swer
that oc curs in the scrip tures. The ques tion is “Do you know why in the
fifth ob la tion wa ter is called man?” (Chh. Up. V.3.3). The an swer is
given in the whole pas sage which, af ter ex plain ing how the five ob la -
tions in the form of Sraaddha, Soma, rain, food and seed are of fered

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 1 307
```

in the five fires, viz., the heav enly world, Parjanya (rain God), the
earth, man and woman, con cludes “For this rea son is wa ter, in the
fifth ob la tion, called man”. Go through the sec tion Panchagnividya in
Chh. Up. V. parts 3-10. Hence we un der stand that the soul goes en -
vel oped by wa ter. Though the el e ments are avail able ev ery where, yet
the seeds for a fu ture body can not be eas ily pro cured any where. The
or gans, etc., which go with the soul can not ac com pany it with out a
ma te rial body.
Just as a cat er pil lar takes hold of an other ob ject be fore it leaves
its hold of an ob ject, so also the soul has the vi sion of the body to
come be fore it leaves the pres ent body. Hence the view of the
Sankhyas that the Self and the or gans are both all-per vad ing and
when ob tain ing a new body only be gin to func tion in it on ac count of
Karma; the view of the Bauddhas that the soul alone with out the or -
gans be gins to func tion in a new body, new senses be ing formed like
the new body; the view of the Vaiseshikas that the mind alone goes to
the new body; and the view of the Digambara Jains that the soul only
flies away from the old body and alights in the new one just as a par rot
flies from one tree to an other are not cor rect and are op pos ing to the
Vedas. The soul goes from the body ac com pa nied by the mind,
Prana, the senses and the Sukshmabhutas or sub tle el e ments.
An ob jec tion can be raised that wa ter only ac com pa nies the
soul and not any other el e ment. How can it be said then that the soul
goes en vel oped by the sub tle parts of all el e ments. To this ob jec tion
the next Su tra gives the re ply.

**Tryatmakatvattu bhuyastvat** III.1.2 ( 293 )

On account of water consisting of three (elements) (the soul is
enveloped by all these elements and not merely water); but
(water alone is mentioned in the text) on account of its
preponderance (in the human body).

**Tryatmakatvattu:** on account of (water) consisting of three elements;
**Tu:** but; **Bhuyastvat:** on account of the preponderance (of water).

The wa ter which en vel ops the soul is three fold. It de notes all the
other el e ments by im pli ca tion. The text spec i fies wa ter, be cause it
pre pon der ates in the hu man body. In all an i mated bod ies liq uid sub -
stances such as juices, blood and the like pre pon der ate.
The word ‘tu’ (but), re moves the ob jec tion raised above. Wa ter
stands for all the el e ments be cause it is re ally a com bi na tion of wa ter,
fire and earth ac cord ing to the tri par tite cre ation of the gross el e -
ments. There fore all the three el e ments ac com pany the soul. No body
can be formed by wa ter alone. Fur ther liq uid mat ter is pre dom i nant in

which are nec es sary for Karma, which is an ef fi cient cause for the
build ing of the fu ture body.

**àmUJVoüŸ&**

**Pranagatescha** III.1.3 ( 294 )
And because of the going out of the Pranas (the sense organs)
with the soul, the elements also accompany the soul.

**Prana:** of the Pranas (the sense organs); **Gateh:** because of the
going out; **Cha:** and.

A fur ther rea son is given to show that the sub tle es sences of the
el e ments ac com pany the soul at the dis so lu tion of the body. The Sruti
has stated that the Pranas and senses de part along with the in di vid -
ual soul at the dis so lu tion of the body. “When he thus de parts the chief
Prana de parts af ter him, and when the chief Prana thus de parts all the
other Pranas de part af ter it” (Bri. Up. IV.4.2). They can not stay with out
the ba sis or sub stra tum or sup port of the el e ments. There fore it fol -
lows that the in di vid ual soul de parts at tended by the sub tle es sences
of the el e ments at the dis so lu tion of the body. The sub tle el e ments
form the base for the mov ing of Pranas. The go ing of the Pranas is not
pos si ble with out a base. The Pranas can not ei ther move or abide
any where with out such a base. This is ob served in liv ing be ings.
There can be en joy ment only when the Prana goes to an other
body. When the soul de parts the chief Prana also fol lows. When the
chief Prana de parts all the other Pranas and or gans also fol low. The
es sences of el e ments are the ve hi cle of Pranas. Where the el e ments
are, there the or gans and Pranas are. They are never sep a rated.

**A½Ý`m{XJ{VlwVo[a{V MoÞ ^mº$ËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Agnyadigatisruteriti chet na bhaktatvat** III.1.4 ( 295 )

If it be said (that the Pranas or the organs do not follow the
soul) on account of the scriptural statements as to entering
into Agni, etc., (we say) not so, on account of its being so said in
a secondary sense (or metaphorical nature of these
statements).

**Agnyadi:** Agni and others; **Gati:** entering; **Sruteh:** on account of the
scriptures; **Iti:** as thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not so (it cannot be accepted);
**Bhaktatvat:** on account of its being said in a secondary sense.

The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor de nies that at the time when a
new body is ob tained the Pranas go with the soul, be cause the scrip -
ture speaks of their go ing to Agni, etc. This Su tra re futes this view.
The text which says that Pranas on death go to Agni and other
gods says so in a fig u ra tive and sec ond ary sense just as when it says
that the hair goes to the trees. The text means only that the Pranas
ob tain the grace of Agni and other gods.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 1 309
```

The en ter ing of speech, etc., into Agni is met a phor i cal. Al though
the text says that the hairs of the body en ter into the shrubs and the
hairs of the head into the trees. It does not mean that the hairs ac tu -
ally fly away from the body and en ter into trees and shrubs.
The scrip tural texts clearly say “When the soul de parts, the
Prana fol lows. When the Prana de parts, all the or gans fol low” (Bri.
Up. IV.4.2.)
Fur ther the soul could not go at all if the Prana could not fol low it.
The soul could not en ter into the new body with out Prana. There
could be no en joy ment in the new body with out the Pranas go ing to
this body.
The pas sage met a phor i cally ex presses that Agni and other de i -
ties who act as guides of the Pranas and the senses and co op er ate
with them, stop their co op er a tion at the time of death. The Pranas and
the senses con se quently lose their re spec tive func tions and are sup -
posed to be im mersed in the guid ing de i ties. The Pranas and the
senses re main at that time quite in op er a tive, wait ing for ac com pa ny -
ing the de part ing soul.
The en ter ing of speech into fire, etc., means only that at the time
of death, these senses and Pranas cease to per form their func tions
and not that they are ab so lutely lost to the soul. The con clu sion,
there fore, is that the Pranas and the senses do ac com pany the soul
at the time of death.

**Prathame’sravanaditi chet na ta eva hi upapatteh** III.1.5 ( 296 )

If it be objected on the ground of water not being mention ed in
the first of the oblations, we say not so, because that (water)
only is verily meant by the word “Sraddha” because that is the
most appropriate meaning of the word in that passage.

**Prathame:** in the first of the five ob la tions de scribed in the
Chhandogya Sruti; **Asravanat:** on ac count of not be ing men tioned;
**Iti:** thus; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not; **Ta eva:** that only, i.e., wa ter; **Hi:** be cause;
**Upapatteh:** be cause of fit ness.

The Purvapakshin raises an ob jec tion: How can it be as cer -
tained that ‘in the fifth ob la tion wa ter is called man’ as there is no
mean ing of wa ter in the first ob la tion? On that al tar the gods of fer
Sraddha as ob la tion (Chh. Up. V.4.2).
The Siddhantin gives his an swer: In the case of the first fire the
word Sraddha is to be taken in the sense of ‘wa ter’. Why? Be cause of
ap pro pri ate ness. Then only there is har mony in the be gin ning, mid dle
and end of the pas sage and the syn thet i cal unity of the whole pas -
sage is not dis turbed. Oth er wise the ques tion and an swer would not
agree and so the unity of the whole pas sage would be de stroyed.

ob la tion. There fore the word Sraddha must be taken to mean ‘wa ter’.
Wa ter is called Sraddha in the Sruti texts. “ _Sraddha va
apaha_ —Sraddha in deed is wa ter” (Tait. Sam. I.6.8.1). Fur ther it is the
Sraddha (faith) which leads to sac ri fice which leads to rain.
It is the other four of fer ings Soma, rain, food and seed that are
de scribed to be the ef fects of Sraddha. It is Sraddha which mod i fies it -
self into these four. There fore it must be a sub stance be long ing to the
same cat e gory as these four, be cause the cause can not be dif fer ent
from its ef fect. An ef fect is only a mod i fi ca tion of the cause. There fore
it is rea son able to in ter pret Sraddha to mean wa ter here.

**Asrutatvaditi chet na ishtadikarinam pratiteh** III.1.6 ( 297 )

If it be said that on account of (the soul) not being stated in the
Sruti (the soul does not depart enveloped by water, etc.) (we
say) not so, because it is understood (from the scriptures) that
the Jivas who perform sacrifices and other good works (alone
go to heaven).

**Asrutatvat:** on account of this not being stated in the Sruti; **Iti:** this;
**Chet:** if; **Na:** not; **Ishtadikarinam:** in reference to those who perform
sacrifices; **Pratiteh:** on account of being understood.

An ob jec tion is raised that in the Chhandogya Upanishad (V.3.3)
there is men tion of wa ter only but no ref er ence to the soul (Jiva). This
ob jec tion can not stand. The pas sage re fers to the per sons per form -
ing sac ri fices, i.e., the per form ers of Ishta (sac ri fice) and Purta (dig -
ging tanks, build ing tem ples, etc.) and Dana (char ity), go ing by the
path of smoke (Dhuma marga or Dakshinayana Path to the world of
moon) Chh. Up. V.10.3.
To those per sons who have per formed Ishtis, etc., wa ter is sup -
plied in the form of ma te ri als used in the Agnihotra, the
Darsapurnamasa and other sac ri fices, viz., sour milk, milk, curd, etc.
The ma te ri als like milk, curds, etc., that are of fered as ob la tions in
sac ri fices as sume a sub tle form called Apurva and at tach them selves
to the sac ri ficer. The Jivas thus go en vel oped by wa ter which is sup -
plied by the ma te ri als that are of fered as ob la tions in sac ri fices. The
wa ter form ing the ob la tions as sumes the sub tle form of Apurva, en -
vel ops the souls and leads them to the heaven to re ceive their re -
ward.
An other ob jec tion is raised now by the Purvapakshin. He says
“that is the food of the gods. The gods do eat it” (Chh. Up. V.10.4.)
“Hav ing reached the moon they be come food and then the Devas
feed on them there” (Bri. Up. VI.2.16). If they are eaten by gods as by
ti gers, how could they en joy the fruit of their ac tions? The fol low ing
Su tra gives a suit able an swer. The per form ers of sac ri fices ob tain the

name of ‘Somaraja’ when they reach Chandraloka. This tech ni cal
name ‘Somaraja’ is ap plied here to the soul.

But (the souls’ being the food of the gods in heaven is used) in a
secondary or metaphorical sense, on account of their not
knowing the Self because the Sruti declares like that.

**Bhaktam:** Metaphorical; **Va:** but, or; **Anatmavittvat:** on account of
their not knowing the Self; **Tatha:** so; **Hi:** because; **Darsayati:** (Sruti)

```
“The soul be comes the food of gods” has to be un der stood in a
```
met a phor i cal or sec ond ary sense and not lit er ally. Oth er wise the

state ment of scrip tures such as “He who is de sir ous of heaven must

per form sac ri fice” is mean ing less. If the Devas were to eat the souls
why should men then ex ert them selves to go there and why should

they per form sac ri fices like Jyotistoma and the rest? Food is the

cause of en joy ment. ‘Eat ing’ is the re joic ing of the gods with the per -
form ers of sac ri fices. The sac ri fices are ob jects of en joy ment to the

gods just as wives, chil dren and cat tle are to men. It is not ac tual eat -

ing like the chew ing and swal low ing of sweet meats. The gods do not
eat in the or di nary way. The scrip ture says “The gods do not eat or

drink. They are sat is fied by see ing the nec tar.”
Those who per form sac ri fices re joice like ser vants of a king, al -

though they are sub or di nate to the gods. They give en joy ment to the

gods and re joice with them. Those who do not know the Self are ob -
jects of en joy ment for the gods. This is known from texts like “Now, if a

man wor ships an other de ity, think ing the de ity is one and he is an -

other, he does not know. He is like a beast for the Devas” (Bri. Up.
I.4.10). That means he in this life pro pi ti ates the gods by means of ob -

la tions and other works, serves them like a beast and does so in the

other world also, de pend ing on them like a beast and en joys the fruits
of his works as as signed by them. They (the per form ers of such sac ri -

fices) be come ser vice able com pan ions to the gods. They en joy the

com pan ion ship of the gods. So they are said to be the food of the

gods in the fig u ra tive or met a phor i cal sense. They con trib ute to the
en joy ment of the gods by their pres ence and ser vice in that world.

There fore it is quite clear that the soul goes en vel oped with the sub tle

es sence of el e ments when it goes to other spheres for en joy ing the
fruits of his good deeds. He en joys in the Chandraloka and re turns to

the earth at the end of his store of merit.

**Kritatyaye’nusayavan drishtasmritibhyam**

**yathetamanevam cha** III.1.8 ( 299 )

On the exhaustion of good work the soul returns to the earth

with a remainder of the Karmas, as can be understood from

direct statement in Sruti and Smriti, by the same route
through which he ascended after death and differently too.

**Krita:** of what is done, of the Karma; **Atyaye:** at the end, at the
exhaustion; **Anusayavan:** with a remainder of the Karma;
**Drishtasmritibhyam:** as can be understood from direct statement in
Sruti and Smriti; **Yatha itam:** by the way he went; **Anevam:**
differently; **Cha:** and.

A fresh topic is dis cussed here. This Adhikarana teaches the
mode of re turn from heaven. The ques tion is raised whether the
souls, af ter hav ing en joyed the fruits of all their works, re turn to the
earth with any rem nant of Karma (Karmasesha) or not. The
Purvapakshin or the op po nent says that there is no rem nant of
Karma. Why? On ac count of the spec i fi ca tion “ _Yavat sampatam_ ”. The
Sruti says “Hav ing dwelt there till their work is ex hausted, they re turn
again the way they went by” (Chh. Up. V.10.5). This in di cates that all
their Karma is com pletely ex hausted there and there is noth ing left.
This view is wrong. The right view is that the souls re turn to the
earth by the force of some unenjoyed rem nant or Anusaya of Karma.
When the to tal ity of works which helped the souls to go to the
Chandraloka for en joy ment of the fruits of good deeds is ex hausted,
then the body made up of wa ter which had orig i nated there for the
sake of en joy ment is dis solv ed by the fire of sor row spring ing from the
thought that the en joy ment co mes to an end, just as hail stones melt
by con tact with the rays of the sun, just as ghee melts by con tact with
the fire. Then the souls come down with a re main der yet left.
This is proved by Sruti and Smriti as well. The Sruti says “Those
whose con duct, dur ing the pre vi ous life, has been good, pres ently ob -
tain good birth, such as the birth of a Brah min, a Kshatriya or a Vaisya;
those whose con duct has been bad pres ently ob tain some evil birth
such as that of a dog or a pig” (Chh. Up. V.10.7).
The Smriti says “The mem bers of the dif fer ent castes and of the
dif fer ent or ders of life who are en gaged in the works pre scrib ed for
them, af ter leav ing this world and en joy ing the fruits of their works in
the other world, are born again ow ing to the unenjoyed por tion of their
re wards, in dis tin guished castes and fam i lies, with spe cial beauty,

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 1 313
```

lon gev ity, knowl edge, con duct, prop erty, com fort and in tel li gence”.
Hence the soul is born with re sid ual Karma.
What is such Anusaya (re sid ual work) of Karma which leads to
higher or lower birth? Of what kind is that re main der? Some say that
thereby we have to un der stand a re main der of the works which had
been per formed in the pre vi ous birth to ob tain heaven and whose
fruits have for the greater part been en joyed. That res i due might be
com pared to the re main der of oil which sticks to the in side of a ves sel
pre vi ously filled with oil even af ter it has been emp tied or to a court ier
of a king who loses his Dur bar robe and there fore co mes out with his
shoes and um brella alone. These anal o gies are ob vi ously wrong, be -
cause when a vir tu ous deed leads the soul to heaven, we can not as -
sume that a por tion of it brings him down to the earth. This would
con tra dict the text which de clares clearly that heaven alone is the fruit
of mer i to ri ous acts and no res i due con tin ues to ex ist.
More over the scrip tural pas sage dis tin guishes re main ders of a
dif fer ent kind, viz., ‘those whose con duct has been good; those
whose con duct has been bad’. The lat ter can not be a por tion of the
vir tu ous deed which leads the soul to the heaven. There fore the
Anusaya is the res i due or rem nant of some other store of Kar mas
bear ing fruit. Af ter the fruits of the mer i to ri ous acts have com pletely
been en joyed in heaven, the re main ing other set of works (good and
bad) whose fruits are to be en joyed in this world forms the Anusaya
with which the souls come to the earth.
An other view is that af ter death the en tire store of Kar mas about
to bear fruit fruc ti fies. There fore the souls come to the earth with out
any Anusaya or res i due of Karma. This is wrong. This is un ten a ble.
Some of those Kar mas can be en joyed only in one kind of birth and
some in an other. They can not com bine in one birth. It can not be said
that one por tion ceases to bear fruit. There is no such ces sa tion save
by Prayaschitta or ex pi a tion. If all Kar mas bear fruit af ter death, there
will be no cause for re birth af ter life in heaven or hell or in an i mal bod -
ies, be cause in these there is no means of vir tue or vice. More over
some cap i tal sins like the kill ing of a Brah min in volve many births.
How then can the to tal ity of Kar mas lead to one birth alone? The
scrip ture is the sole source of vir tue and vice. Sim i larly the Kariri Ishti,
a sac ri fice of fered by those who are de sir ous of rain, causes rain.
There fore you can not as cribe it to the fruc tifi ca tion of past acts af ter
death. There fore the view that death man i fests all ac tions, that all
events are due to the fruc tifi ca tion of com plete store of Kar mas af ter
death is en tirely in cor rect and base less.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor ar gues that just as a lamp
shows all ob jects, so also death ex hausts all Kar mas. This anal ogy is
not cor rect. Be cause a lamp, al though equally dis tant from a big and a
very small ob ject, may man i fest only the big one and not the small ob -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 314
```

ject. So death ex cites the op er a tion of the stron ger ac tions only, not
the weaker ones, al though there is equal op por tu nity for both sets of
works for fruc tifi ca tion. There fore the view that all ac tions are man i -
fested by death can not be up held, be cause it is con tra dicted by Sruti,
Smriti and rea son.
You need not be afraid that if any Kar mas are left in store there
will be no sal va tion, be cause knowl edge of Self will an ni hi late all Kar -
mas. There fore it is an es tab lished con clu sion that the souls de scend
to the earth from heaven with a re main der of works (Anusaya).
By what way does it de scend? They re turn by the same way that
they went by, but with some dif fer ence. From the ex pres sion “as they
came” and from the fact of ‘ether and smoke’ it is con cluded that they
de scend by the way they went to the heaven (Chh. Up. V.10.5). That
there is some dif fer ence too is known from night, etc., not be ing men -
tioned and from the cloud, etc., be ing added (Chh. Up. V.10.6). He de -
s cends by the route by which he went to a cer tain stage and then by a
dif fer ent route. The word ‘Ramaniyacharana’ means works which are
Ramaniya or good. ‘Kapuyacharana’ means evil acts. The word
‘Yavat sampatam’ does not mean the ex haus tion of all Kar mas, but
the ex haus tion of the works that took the soul to heaven and which is
ex hausted in heaven by en joy ment.

**Charanaditi chet na upalakshanartheti karshnajinih** III.1.9 ( 300 )
If it be objected that on account of conduct (the assumption of
the remnant of Karma, Anusaya is not necessary for rebirth on
earth), (we say) not so (because the word ‘conduct’ is used) to
signify indirectly (the remainder). So Karshnajini thinks.

**Charanat:** on account of conduct; **Iti:** thus, so; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not so;
**Upalakshanartha:** to signify secondarily, indirectly, meant to imply or
connote; **Iti:** thus; **Karshnajinih:** Karshnajini thinks, holds, says.

An ob jec tion is raised with ref er ence to the re sid ual Karma,
Anusaya, stated in the pre ced ing Su tra and is re futed.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor says in the text cited (Chh.
Up. V.10.7.) “those whose con duct has been good” etc., get a good
birth.
The qual ity of the new birth de pends on ‘Charana’ or con duct,
not on Anusaya or re main der of work. ‘Charana’ and ‘Anusaya’ are
dif fer ent things be cause ‘Charana’ is the same as Charitra, Achara,
Sila—all of which mean con duct, while Anusaya means re main der of
work.
Scrip ture also says that ac tion and con duct are dif fer ent things
“Ac cord ing as he acts and ac cord ing as he con ducts him self so will he
be” (Bri. Up. IV.4.5).

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 1 315
```

The ob jec tion is with out force. This Su tra re futes this and says
that the term ‘con duct’ is meant to de note the re main der of the works
(good Kar mas) af ter en joy ment in the other world. Con duct stands for
Karma which de pends on good con duct. This is the opin ion of the
sage Karshnajini. This is sec ond ary im pli ca tion of the term.

**AmZW©Š`{_{V MoÞ VXnojËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Anarthakyamiti chet na tadapekshatvat** III.1.10 (301)

If it be said (by such interpretation of the word ‘conduct’
—good conduct would become) purposeless, (we say) not so,
on account of (Karma) being dependent on that (good conduct).

**Anarthakyam:** purposeless, useless, irrelevancy; **Iti:** thus, as; **Chet:**
if; **Na:** not so; **Tat:** that (conduct); **Apekshatvat:** on account of
dependence on that.

A fur ther ob jec tion with ref er ence to the word ‘Charana—con -
duct’ is raised and re futed in this Su tra.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor says that may be, but why
should we give up that mean ing which the word ‘Charana’ di rectly
con veys viz., ‘con duct’ and take up the merely con no ta tive mean ing
‘res i due of Karma’. Then good con duct would be pur pose less in
man’s life, as it has no re sult of its own, not be ing a cause of the qual -
ity of new birth. Con duct which is the di rect mean ing of the word may
have for its fruit ei ther a good or an evil birth ac cord ing as it is good or
bad. Some fruit will have to be al lowed to it in any case for oth er wise it
would be pur pose less.
This Su tra re futes this. The Su tra de nies this view on the ground
that only those who are of good con duct are en ti tled to per form Ve dic
sac ri fices. This ob jec tion is with out force on ac count of the de pend -
ence on it. It can not stand. The Smriti says, “Him who is de void of
good con duct the Vedas do not pu rify.” He, whose con duct is not
good, does not at tain re li gious merit by mere per for mance of sac ri -
fices. Con duct en hances the fruit of Karma (Atisaya). Good con duct
is an aid or aux il iary to Karma. There fore it has a pur pose. When the
sac ri fice be gins to pro duce its fruit, the con duct which has ref er ence
to the sac ri fice will orig i nate in the fruit some ad di tion. It is, there fore,
the view of Karshnajini that the res i due of works only which is the in di -
rect mean ing of the term ‘Charana’ or con duct and not just con duct is
the cause of the new birth. If a man is able to run by means of his feet
he will cer tainly not creep on his knees. If a man can not run on his
legs, can he run on his knees?

**Sukritadushkrite eveti tu baadarih** III.1.11 (302)
But conduct (Charana) means merely good and evil works;
thus the sage Baadari thinks.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 316
```

**Sukrita:** good or righteous deeds; **Dushkrite:** (and) bad or

unrighteous deeds; **Eva:** only, merely; **Iti:** thus; **Tu:** but; **Baadarih:**

(Sage) Baadari.

Fur ther dis cus sion on the mean ing of the word ‘Charana’ is
made here. The Su tra says that there is no dif fer ence be tween con -
duct and Karma. Ac cord ing to the sage Baadari the phrases
‘Ramaniyacharana’ and ‘Kapuyacharana’ mean good and evil works.
Charana means the same as Anusthana or Karma (work). The
root ‘Char’ (to walk, to con duct one self) is used in the gen eral sense
of act ing. Peo ple say in com mon par lance of a man who does sac ri -
fices. “That man walks in righ teous ness.” The term Achara also de -
notes only a kind of re li gious duty. A sac ri fice is a mer i to ri ous act
(Dharma). Achara is also Dharma. When Karma and Charana are
sep a rately de scribed it is as when you speak of Brah mins and
Parivrajakas, i.e., Sannyasis. Though Charana and Karma are one,
yet they are spo ken of some times as dif fer ent on the maxim of
“Kuru-Pandavas.” Though the Pandavas were also Kurus, yet in the
phrase Kurus and Pandavas the word Kuru is used in a nar rower
sense. Thus ‘men of good con duct or char ac ter’ means those whose
ac tions are praise wor thy; ‘men of evil con duct or evil Charana’ are
those whose ac tions are to be cen sured. Con duct is used in the gen -
eral sense of ac tion. As Charana is Karma only, it is es ta b lished,
there fore, that those who go to heaven have re main der of Karma
(Anusaya) as the cause of a new birth on earth.
_Eva_ —only: The force of this word in this Su tra is to in di cate that
this is the opin ion of the au thor of the Sutras.
_Tu_ —‘but’ is used to in di cate spe ci al ity, one’s own con clu sion
and to add em pha sis.

who do not per form sac ri fices go to the sphere of moon or not.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 1 317
```

The Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains that even they go
to heaven though they do not en joy any thing there like those who per -
form sac ri fices, be cause they too are in need of the fifth ob la tion for a

new birth. More over the Sruti de clares: “All who de part from this world
go to the sphere of moon” (Kau. Up. I.2). The word ‘all’ shows that it is
a uni ver sal prop o si tion with out any qual i fi ca tions. Since all who per -

ish must go to the world of moon, it fol lows that the sin ners also go
there.

Siddhantin: The sin ners do not go to the sphere of moon. They
go to Yamaloka or the world of pun ish ment. This is said in the fol low -

ing Su tra.

**Vidyakarmanoriti tu prakritatvat** III.1.17 (308)

But (the reference is to the two roads) of knowledge and work,

those two being under discussion.

**Vidyakarmanoh:** of knowledge and work; **Iti:** thus; **Tu:** but, only;

**Prakritatvat:** on account of these being the subject under discussion.

But the sin ners never go to heaven be cause the topic re lat ing to
the two paths in the Chhandogya Upanishad is con fined to men of
knowl edge and men of work. It has no ref er ence to evil-do ers. The dif -
fer ent jour neys of the de parted souls to the other world through the
two roads or paths de scribed in the Panchagnividya of Chhandogya
Upanishad are the re sults of knowl edge (med i ta tion) and re li gious

that world will get overfull. But you may re ply that there will be souls
go ing out from there to the earth. But then the Sruti text clearly says
that the evil-do ers do not go there.
The evil-do ers go to the third place and not to heaven. The Sruti
pas sage says “Now those who go along nei ther of these ways be -
come those small crea tures con tin u ally re turn ing of whom it may be
said ‘Live and die’. Theirs is a third place. There fore the world never
be comes full” (Chh. Up. V.10.8).
The word ‘but’ in the Su tra re futes a doubt that arises from a text
from Kaushitaki Upanishad, ‘That all de parted go to the
Chandraloka’. The word ‘all’ has to be taken as re fer ring only to those
who are qual i fied, who have per formed good deeds. All el i gi ble souls
only go to Chandraloka. It does not in clude evil do ers or sin ners.
The word ‘but’ sets aside the view pro pounded by the ob jec tor. If
the sin ners do not go to the world of moon or Chandraloka, then no
new body can be pro duced in their case: be cause there is no fifth ob -
la tion pos si ble in their case and the fifth ob la tion de pends on one’s
go ing to the sphere of moon. There fore all must go to the
Chandraloka in or der to get a new body. This ob jec tion is an swered
by the next Su tra.

**Z V¥Vr`o VWmonbãYo...Ÿ&**

**Na tritiye tathopalabdheh** III.1.18 (309)
Not in (the case of) a third place, as it is thus declared in the

scriptures.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 320
```

**Na:** not; **Tritiye:** in the third; **Tatha:** so thus; **Upalabdheh:** it being

perceived or seen to be.

The fifth ob la tion is not nec es sary in the case of those who go to
the third place, be cause it is thus de clared in the scrip tures.
The rule about the five ob la tions does not ap ply in the case of
evil-do ers or sin ners be cause they are born with out the ob la tions.
The Sruti says, “Live and die. That is the third place.” That is to say
these small crea tures (flies, worms, etc.,) are con tin u ally be ing born
and are dy ing. The sin ners are called small crea tures be cause they
as sume the bod ies of in sects, gnats etc. Their place is called the third
place, be cause it is nei ther the Brahmaloka nor the Chandraloka.
Hence the heaven world never be comes full, be cause these sin ners
never go there. More over, in the pas sage, “In the fifth ob la tion wa ter is
called man” the wa ter be comes the body of a man only, not of an in -
sect or moth etc. The word ‘man’ ap plies to the hu man spe cies only.

**ñ_`©Vo@{n M bmoHo$Ÿ&**

**Smaryate’pi cha loke** III.1.19 (310)
And (moreover the) Smritis have recorded also (that) in this
world (there had been cases of birth without the course of five
oblations).

**Smaryate:** is stated in Smritis; **Api:** also; **Cha:** and; **Loke:** in the

world.

The ar gu ment com menced in Su tra 17 to re fute the ob jec tions
raised in Su tra 12, is con tin ued.
There are, more over, tra di tions, apart from the Vedas that cer -
tain per sons like Drona, Dhrishtadyumna, Sita, Draupadi and oth ers
were not born in the or di nary way from mother’s womb. In their cases
there was want ing the fifth ob la tion which is made to the woman. In
the case of Dhrishtadyumna and oth ers, even two of the ob la tions,
viz., the one of fered into woman and the one of fered into man, were
ab sent. Drona had no mother. Dhrishtadyumna had nei ther fa ther nor
mother. Hence in many other cases also, pro cre ation or birth may be
sup posed to take place in de pend ently of ob la tions. The fe male crane
con ceives with out a male.
The five ob la tions are not ab so lutely nec es sary for a fu ture birth.
The rule about the five ob la tions is not uni ver sal. It ap plies only to
those who do sac ri fices. There fore the sin ners need not go to
heaven.
The five ob la tions have noth ing to do with the third way, i.e., die
and be born in low bod ies. They re fer only to hu man births in the case
of souls who as cend and then de scend. In the case of oth ers em bodi -
ment may take place in a man ner other than through wombs.

from heat and mois ture and be ings spring ing from germs

(plants)—the last two classes are pro duced with out sex ual in ter -

course, so that in their case the num ber of ob la tions is of no con se -

quence.
The Purvapakshin or the ob jec tor says, “The Sruti pas sage

speaks only of three classes of be ings: That which springs from an

egg (Andaja), that which springs from a liv ing be ing (Jivaja) and that

which springs from a germ (Udbhijja)” (Chh. Up. VI.3.1). How then

can it be main tained that there are four classes? The fol low ing Su tra

gives a re ply to his ob jec tion.

**V¥Vr`eãXmdamoY... g§emoH$Oñ`Ÿ&**

**Tritiyasabdavarodhah samsokajasya** III.1.21 (312)
The third term (i.e. plant life) includes that which springs from
heat and moisture.

**Tritiya sabda:** the third term; **Avarodhah:** inclusion; **Samsokajasya:**
of that which springs from heat and moisture.

```
The two classes spring from earth or wa ter, from some thing sta -
```
ble. They both ger mi nate: one from the earth and the other from wa -

ter. It makes no dif fer ence be cause that which springs from mois ture

is in cluded in the place of plant life (Udbhijja). There is sim i lar ity be -

tween Svedaja and Udbhijja. Hence there is no con tra dic tion. Those

which are born of sweat are called Svedaja. Svedaja and Udbhijja are

not born of wombs. The word Udbhijja lit er ally means born by burst ing

through. The plants burst through the earth. The sweatborn burst

through the wa ter. Thus the or i gin of both is sim i lar, for both are born

by burst ing through.
Thus the evil-do ers do not go to heaven. Only those who per -

form sac ri fices go to heaven. This is the set tled con clu sion.

Sabhavyapattyadhikaranam: Topic 4
The soul on its descent from the Chandraloka does not become
identi fied with ether, etc., but attains a similarity of nature
```
**VËgm^mì`mn{ÎménnÎmo...Ÿ&**

**Tatsabhavyapattirupapatteh** III.1.22 (313)

(The soul when com ing down from the sphere of moon) at tains
sim i lar ity of na ture with them, (i.e., with ether, air, etc.,) as this only is
pos si ble.
**Tatsabhavyapattih:** attainment of a similarity of nature with them;
**Upapatteh:** being reasonable.

The way of de scent of the in di vid ual soul from the sphere of the
moon is now dis cussed. The Sruti de clares, “They re turn again the
way they went, to the ether, from the ether to the air. Then the sac ri -
ficer hav ing be come air be comes smoke, hav ing be come smoke he
be comes mist, hav ing be come mist, he be comes a cloud, hav ing be -
come a cloud he rains down” (Chh. Up. V.10.5 & 6).
Now a ques tion arises whether the soul ac tu ally be comes iden -
ti cal with ether, etc., or sim ply re sem bles them.
This Su tra says that the souls do not at tain iden tity with them,
be cause it is im pos si ble. It is not pos si ble that one thing should be -
come an other in the lit eral sense of the word. One sub stance can not
be come an other. If the souls be come iden ti cal with ether, they could
no lon ger de scend through air. The souls be come only like ether, air,
etc. They as sume a sub tle form like ether, come un der the in flu ence
or power of air and get mixed with or con nected with smoke etc. The
at tain ing to the state of be ing smoke, etc., is but mov ing along with
them when they are in mo tion, stop ping while they stop, en ter ing into
them and be com ing as light as they are. There fore the pas sage
means that the souls be come sim i lar to Akasa, air, etc., but not iden ti -
cal.

arises the ques tion, does the soul in its de scent through ether down to
rain, stay at each stage for a very long time, or passes through it

quickly? The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: ‘There be ing noth -
ing to de fine the time of his stay, it re mains in def i nitely long at each
stage.’ This view is set aside by this Su tra. This Su tra says that the
soul passes through them quickly. This is in ferred from the cir cum -
stance of the text mak ing a spe cial state ment.
The Sruti says, ‘Hav ing be come a cloud he rains down. Then he
is born as rice and corn, herbs and trees, sesamum and beans. From
thence the es cape is be set with many dif fi cul ties. For who ever the
per sons may be that eat the food, and be get off spring, he hence forth
be comes like unto them’ (Chh. Up. V.10.5).
The soul’s jour ney, through the stages of the ether, the air, the
vapour or smoke, the mist, the cloud and the rain, takes a shorter time
than his pass ing through the stages of corn, se men, foe tus, which
takes a much lon ger time or hard suf fer ing, as there is the spe cial
state ment in Sruti, that af ter its en trance into a corn the es cape is be -
set with much greater dif fi culty and pain.
The Sruti says “The souls en ter into rice” and adds “from thence
the es cape is be set with more dif fi culty and pain.” There is a hint here
that the es cape from the pre vi ous states or ear lier stages is easy and
pleas ant and at tained quickly.
“He who has be gun to de scend will en ter the mother’s body
(womb) be fore a year passes since start ing, though wan der ing
through dif fer ent places” (Naradiya Purana).

Anyadhisthitadhikaranam: Topic 6 (Sutras 24-27)
When the souls enter into plants, etc., they only cling to them

**Anyadhishthiteshu purvavadabhilapat** III.1.24 (315)
(The descending soul enters) into (plants) animated other

declaration.

**Anyadhishthiteshu:** into what is possessed or occupied by another;
**Purvavat:** like the previous cases; **Abhilapat:** on account of the
scriptural statement.

The dis cus sion on the way of de scent of the in di vid ual soul is
con tin ued.
In the de scrip tion of the soul’s de scent, it is said then they are
born as rice and corn, herbs and beans. Now a doubt arises, are
these souls de scend ing with a rem nant of their Kar mas, them selves
born as rice, corn, etc., or do they merely cling to those plants, etc.
The Purvapakshin holds that they are born as rice, corn, etc.,
and en joy their plea sures and pains on ac count of the re main der of
works still at tach ing to them and do not merely cling to them. The con -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 324
```

di tion of a plant may be a place of en joy ment of the fruits of ac tions.
Sac ri fices which en tail kill ing of an i mals may lead to un pleas ant re -
sults. Hence the word ‘born’ is to be taken lit er ally.
This Su tra re futes this view. The souls are merely con nect ed
with rice and plants which are al ready an i mated by other souls and do
not en joy there plea sures and pains as in pre vi ous cases. As the
souls be com ing air, smoke, was de cided to mean only that they be -
come con nected with them, so here also their be com ing rice, etc.,
merely means that they be come con nected with those plants. Be -
cause in these stages there is no ref er ence to their Karma, just as in
the ear lier stages of ether etc. They en ter these plants in de pend ently
of their Karma. They do not en joy plea sure and pain while they abide
there. The souls use the rice and plants as their halt ing sta tion with out
be ing iden ti fied with it, as it is ex pressly stated in Sruti to be a pass ing
stage, like the pre vi ous stages of ether, air etc. They do not lose their
iden tity. The souls are not born there for the pur pose of re trib u tive en -
joy ment. Where real birth takes place and ex pe ri ence of plea sure and
pain com mences, the fruits of ac tions be gin, the text re fers to the op -
er a tion of Karma as in “Those whose con duct has been good will
quickly at tain a good birth” (Chh. Up. V.10.7).
Fur ther if the word ‘born’ is taken in its lit eral sense, then the
souls which have de scended into the rice plants and are an i mat ing
them would have to leave them when they are reaped, husked,
cooked and eaten. When a body is de stroyed the soul that an i mates it
aban dons it.
There fore the de scend ing souls are merely out wardly con -
nected with the plants an i mated by other souls. They abide till they at -
tain the op por tu nity for a new birth.

An ob jec tion may be raised that the sac ri fi cial work, such as the

There fore its re sult may cause the sac ri ficer to be ac tu ally born as a
corn or a plant as pen alty for his cruel ac tion. Such ob jec tion is
ground less, be cause the kill ing of an i mals in sac ri fices causes no de -

The sac ri fices are not im pure or sin ful be cause the scrip tures
de clare them to be mer i to ri ous. The scrip tures alone can tell us what

is Dharma and what is Adharma, what is holy and what is un holy. Our
knowl edge of what is duty and the con trary of duty de pends en tirely
on Sastras, be cause these are Atindriya, i.e., be yond sense per cep -
tion and there is in the case of right and wrong an en tire want of bind -
ing rules as to place, time and oc ca sion. What in one place, at one
time on one oc ca sion is per formed as a right ac tion, is a wrong ac tion
in an other place, at an other time, on an other oc ca sion. There fore no
one can know with out a scrip ture, what is ei ther right or wrong. No
doubt the scrip ture says that one must not cause in jury ( _Ma himsyat
sarva bhutani_ —let not any an i mal be in jured (killed). That is the gen -
eral rule. ‘Let him of fer an an i mal sa cred to Agnistoma’ is an ex cep -
tion. Gen eral rule and ex cep tion have dif fer ent spheres of ap pli ca tion.
They have dif fer ent scopes set tled by us age, and so there is no con -
flict be tween them.
There fore we con clude that the souls be come en closed in
plants when scrip ture says that the de scend ing souls from the
Chandraloka be come plants. They are per fectly un con scious in these
stages.

Then (the soul gets) connected with him who performs the act
of generation.

**Retah:** one who ejects the seminal fluid; **Yoga:** connection with;
**Atha:** then afterwards.

The dis cus sion on the way of de scent of the soul is con tin u ed.
What be comes of the soul af ter its cling ing to the plants is now men -
tioned.
Chhandogya text (V.10.6.) de clares “For who ever eats the food
and per forms the act of gen er a tion, that again he (the soul) be -
comes”. Here again the soul’s ‘be com ing’, i.e., he who per forms the
act of gen er a tion can not be taken in its lit eral sense, be cause a man
is able to pro cre ate when he at tains pu berty. We have to un der stand
that the soul gets con nected with one who per forms the act of gen er a -
tion. We again in fer from this that the soul’s be com ing a plant merely
means its en ter ing into con nec tion with the plant and not ac tual birth
as such.
The soul af ter hav ing en tered into a corn or a plant be comes
con nected to him who eats the corn or the fruit and per forms the act of
cop u la tion. In ev ery stage of its pas sage it re tains its dis tinc tive iden -
tity from the bod ies with which it may be con nected.
When ever one eats the food, when ever one per forms the act of
coition, the de scend ing soul be comes again that food and that se -
men. The soul re mains in him in cop u la tion only till he en ters into the
mother’s womb, with the se men in jected. He has a touch with the

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 326
```

sem i nal fluid cre ated by eat ing such grain and ul ti mately at tains a
body in wombs. The soul does not re ally take the form of and be come
iden ti cal with its pro cre ator, be cause one thing can not take the form
of an other thing. If it were to be come lit er ally the pro cre ator, then
there would be no pos si bil ity of the soul’s get ting an other body.

**`moZoíeara_²Ÿ&**

**Yoneh sariram** III.1.27 (318)

From the womb a (new) body (springs).

**Yoneh:** from the womb; **Sariram:** the body.

The dis cus sion on the na ture of the de scent of the soul is con -
cluded here.
Af ter hav ing passed through the var i ous pre ced ing stages, the
soul at last en ters into the womb of the mother. He at tains a fully de -
vel oped hu man body in the womb of the mother which is fit for ex pe ri -
enc ing the fruits of the re main der of works. The fam ily in which it is to
be born is reg u lat ed by the na ture of this re main der as men tioned in
Chh. Up. V.10.7. “Of these, those whose con duct here has been good
will quickly at tain some good birth, the birth of a Brahmana, or a
Kshatriya or a Vaisya. But those whose con duct here has been bad
will quickly at tain an evil birth, the birth of a dog, or a Chandala”.
Thus it has been clearly shown that the soul be comes plant,
etc., in the same sense as it be comes ether, etc.
The whole ob ject of teach ing this law of in car na tion is that you
should real ise that the At man or the Ab so lute alone is the High est
Bliss. This At man alone must be your sole ob ject of quest. You should
get dis gusted with this world of pain and sor row and de velop
dispassion and dis crim i na tion and try ear nestly to at tain the Eter nal
Bliss of the Ab so lute.
O ig no rant man! O fool ish man! O mis er a ble man! O de luded
soul! Wake up from your long slum ber of ig no rance. Open your eyes.
De velop the four means of sal va tion and at tain the goal of life, the
_sum mum bonum_ , right now in this very birth. Come out of this cage of
flesh. You have been long im pris oned in this prisonhouse of body for
time im me mo rial. You have been dwell ing in the womb again and
again. Cut the knot of Avidya and soar high in the realms of Eter nal
Bliss.

INTRODUCTION
```
In the pre ced ing Pada or Sec tion the pas sage of the soul to dif -
fer ent spheres and its re turn has been ex plained in or der to cre ate
dispassion or dis gust in peo ple who per form sac ri fices to ob tain
heaven. If they have a clear un der stand ing of the fate of the soul they
will nat u rally de velop Vairagya and will strive to at tain Moksha or the
fi nal eman ci pa tion.
This sec tion starts with the ex pla na tion of the soul’s dif fer ent
states, viz., wak ing, dream, deep sleep. The three states of the soul
will be shown to be merely il lu sory and the iden tity of the in di vid ual
soul and the Su preme Soul will be es tab lished.
A knowl edge of the three states, viz., wak ing, dream ing and
deep sleep, is very nec es sary for the stu dents of Vedanta. It will help
them to un der stand the na ture of the fourth state, viz., Turiya or the
state of superconsciousness. For a stu dent of Vedanta, the wak ing
state is as much un real as the dream state. The state of deep sleep in -
ti mates that the na ture of the Su p reme Soul is Bliss and that Brah man
is one with out a sec ond, and that the world is un real. Vedantins make
a study of the four states very care fully. They do not ig nore dream and
deep sleep states whereas the sci en tists draw their con clu sions from
the ex pe ri ences of the wak ing state only. Hence, their knowl edge is
lim ited, par tial and in cor rect.
In the last sec tion the wak ing state of the soul has been fully
dealt with. Now its dream state is taken up for dis cus sion.
In or der to make the stu dents un der stand the true sig nif i cance
of the Maha-Vakya or the great sen tence of the Upanishad “ _Tat Tvam
Asi_ —Thou art That”, this sec tion ex plains the true na ture of “That”
and “Thou”.

**SYNOPSIS**
This Sec tion starts with the ex pla na tion of the states of dream,
deep sleep and so on. Then it dis cusses the two fold na ture of Brah -
man, one im ma nent and the other tran scen dent. Lastly it deals with
the re la tion of Brah man to the in di vid ual soul as well as to the world.
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-6) treats of the soul in the dream ing
state. The vi sion in dreams is of a won der ful char ac ter. Ac cord ing to
Sri Sankara the three first Sutras dis cuss the ques tion whether the
cre ative ac tiv ity, at trib uted to the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul in some
Sruti texts pro duces ob jects as real as those by which the soul in the
wak ing state is sur rounded or not.
Su tra 3 says that the cre ations of the dream ing soul are mere
“Maya” or il lu sion as they do not fully ex hibit the na ture or char ac ter of
real ob jects, as they are want ing in the re al ity of the wak ing state.
Su tra 4 in ti mates that dreams, al though mere Maya, yet have a
pro phetic qual ity. Some dreams are in dic a tive of fu ture good or bad.
Sutras 5 and 6 say that the soul, al though it is iden ti cal with the
Lord, is not able to pro duce in dreams a real cre ation, be cause its
knowl edge and power are ob scured by its con nec tion with the gross
body. The rul er ship is hid den by ig no rance in the Jiva state. It is not
pos si ble for the in di vid ual soul to dream a good or a bad dream ac -
cord ing to his own choice as he in his pres ent state of bond age is ig -
no rant of the fu ture.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Sutras 7-8) teaches that the soul abides within
Brah man in the heart in the state of deep sleep.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Su tra 9) gives rea sons to as sume that the soul
awak en ing from sleep is the same that went to sleep. What has been
partly done by a per son be fore go ing to sleep is fin ished af ter he
wakes up. He has also a sense of self-iden tity. He has mem ory of past
events. He has mem ory in the shape of ‘I am the per son who had
gone to sleep and who have now awak ened.’
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Su tra 10) ex plains the na ture of a swoon. It in ti -
mates that swoon is half death and half deep sleep, a mix ture of these
two states.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 11-21) in ti mate the na ture of Su p reme
Brah man in which the in di vid ual soul is merged in the state of deep
sleep.
Su tra 11 de clares that Brah man is de void of dis tinc tive at trib -
utes (Nirvisesha). Brah man with at trib utes is only for the sake of
Upasana or pi ous wor ship of dev o tees. It is not its real na ture.

```
329
```

Su tra 12 de clares that ev ery form due to lim it ing ad junct is de -
nied of Brah man. In ev ery pas sage of Sruti iden tity is af firmed. The
Su preme Truth is One ness. Sep a rate ness is for de vo tion. There is
only one In fi nite form less es sence or Prin ci ple in re al ity.
Su tra 13 says that the whole uni verse char ac ter ised by
enjoyers, things to be en joyed and a ruler has Brah man for its true na -
ture.
Su tra 14 says that the as sump tion of di ver sity or plu ral ity is ob -
jec tion able. Brah man is des ti tute of all forms.
Su tra 15 says Brah man ap pears to have forms, as it were. This
is due to its con nec tion with its un real lim it ing ad juncts, just as the
light of the sun ap pears straight or crooked, as it were, ac cord ing to
the na ture of the thing it il lu mines.
Su tra 16 says that the Sruti (Brihadaranyaka) ex pressly de -
clares that Brah man is one uni form mass of con scious ness or in tel li -
gence and has nei ther in side nor out side.
Su tra 17 says the other scrip tural pas sages and the Smriti also
teach that Brah man is with out at trib utes.
Su tra 18 de clares that just as the one lu mi nous sun when en ter -
ing into re la tion to many dif fer ent wa ters is him self ren dered mul ti form
by his lim it ing ad juncts, so also the one Un born Brah man.
Su tra 19: Here the Purvapakshin ob jects. There is no sim i lar ity
of the two things com pared as in the case of Brah man any sec ond
thing is not ap pre hended or ex pe ri enced like wa ter. Brah man is form -
less and all-per vad ing. It is not a ma te rial thing. Sun has a form. It is a
ma te rial thing. Wa ter is dif fer ent from the sun and is at a dis tance from
the sun. Hence the sun may be re flected in the wa ter.
Su tra 20: The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 19 is re futed. The sim i -
lar ity is only in point of the par tic i pa tion in the dis tor tion and con tor -
tion, in in crease and de crease of the im age re flected. Brah man

_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 22-30) teaches that the clause “ _neti,

Sandhyadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-6)
The soul in the dream state
```
**gÝÜ`o g¥{ï>amh {hŸ&**

**Sandhye srishtiraha hi** III.2.1 ( 319 )

In the intermediate stage (between waking and deep sleep)

there is (a real) creation; because (the Sruti) says so.

**Sandhye:** in the intermediate stage (between waking and deep
sleep, i.e., in the dream state); **Srishtih:** (there is real) creation; **Aha:**
(Sruti) says so; **Hi:** because.

The state of dream is now con sid ered.
Sutras 1 and 2 are Purvapaksha Sutras and set out the view that
what we see in dreams are true cre ations be cause of the word
‘Srijate’ (cre ates).
The word ‘Sandhya’ means dream. It is called ‘Sandhya’ or the
in ter me di ate state be cause it is mid way be tween wak ing (Jagrat) and
the deep sleep state (Sushupti). That place is called the in ter me di ate
state or place be cause it lies there where the two worlds or else the
place of wak ing and the place of deep sleep join.
Scrip ture de clares, “when he falls asleep, there are no char i ots,
in that state, no horses, no roads, but he him self cre ates char i ots,
horses and roads, etc.” (Bri. Up. IV.3.9-10). Here a doubt arises
whether the cre ation which takes place in dreams is a real one
(Paramarthika) like the cre ation seen in the wak ing state or whether it
is il lu sory (Maya).
The Purvapakshin holds that in the dream ing state there is a
real cre ation.
In that in ter me di ate state or dream the cre ation must be real, be -
cause scrip ture which is au thor i ta tive de clares it to be so, “He (the in -
di vid ual soul) cre ates char i ots, horses, roads,” etc. We, more over,
in fer this from the con clud ing clause, “He in deed is the cre ator” (Bri.
Up. IV.3.10).
Fur ther there is no dif fer ence be tween the ex pe ri ence of the
wak ing state and that of the dream state. At man in dream gets plea -
sure by go ing in a car, hear ing mu sic, see ing plea sure-sights and eat -
ing sump tu ous food even as in the wak ing state.
Hence the cre ation of the dream state is real and orig i nates from
the Lord Him self, just as ether, etc., sprang from Him.

**{Z_m©Vma§ M¡Ho$ nwÌmX`üŸ&**

**Nirmataram chaike putradayascha** III.2.2 ( 320 )

And some (the followers of one Sakha, namely, the Kathakas)

(state that the Supreme Lord is the) Creator; sons, etc., (being

the lovely things which He creates).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 332
```

**Nirmataram:** Creator, the shaper, the builder, the maker; **Cha:** and,

more over; **Eke:** some (followers of the particular Sakhas of the

Vedas); **Putradayah:** sons, etc.; **Cha:** and, also.

The Purvapakshin or the op po nent gives a fur ther ar gu ment to
show that the cre ation even in dreams is by the Lord Him self. “He who
is awake in us while we are asleep, shap ing one lovely thing af ter an -
other, that is Brah man” (Katha Up. II.2. 8).
‘Kama’ (lovely things) in this pas sage means sons, etc., that are
so called be cause they are be loved. The term ‘Kama’ does not de -
note mere de sires. It is used in this sense in the pre vi ous pas sage
also, such as “Ask for all Kamas ac cord ing to thy wish” (Katha Up.
I.1.25). That the word Kama there means sons, etc., we in fer from
Katha Up. I.1.23, where we find these Kamas de scribed as sons and
grand sons, etc.
Even in dreams the Lord Him self cre ates just as in the case of
the wak ing state. There fore the world of dreams is also real.
The scrip ture de clares “This is the same as the place of wak ing,
for what he sees while awake the same he sees while asleep” (Bri.
Up. IV.3.14). Hence the world of dreams is real.
To this we re ply as fol lows.

**Mayamatram tu kartsnyena-
anabhivyaktasvarupatvat** III.2.3 ( 321 )

But it (viz., the dream world) is mere illusion on account of its
nature not manifesting itself with the totality (of the attributes
of reality).

**Mayamatram:** mere illusion; **Tu:** but; **Kartsnyena:** entirely, fully;
**Anabhivyaktasvarupatvat:** on account of its nature being

unmanifested.

The the sis ad duced in Sutras 1 and 2 is now criti cised.
The word ‘tu’ (but), dis cards the view ex pressed by the two pre -
vi ous Sutras. The world of dreams is not real. It is mere il lu sion. There
is not a par ti cle of re al ity in it. The na ture of the dream-world does not
agree en tirely with that of the wak ing world with re spect to time, place,
cause and the cir cum stance of non-ref u ta tion. Hence the dream
world is not real like the wak ing world.
In the first place there is in a dream no space for char i ots and the
like, be cause those ob jects can not pos si bly find room in the lim ited
con fines of the body. If you say that the soul goes out and en joys ob -
jects, how can it go hun dreds of miles and re turn within a few min -
utes?
In a dream the soul does not leave the body; be cause if it did,
then one who dreams of hav ing gone to Lon don would find him self

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 333
```

there on wak ing, while he went to sleep in Bom bay. But as a mat ter of
fact, he awakes in Bom bay only.
Fur ther while a man imag ines him self in his dream go ing in his
body to an other place, the by-standers see the very same body ly ing
on the cot.
More over a dream ing per son does not see in his dream other
places such as they re ally are. But if he in see ing them did ac tu ally go
about, they would ap pear to him like the things he sees in his wak ing
state.
Sruti de clares that the dream is within the body, “But when he
moves about in dream, he moves about ac cord ing to his plea sure
within his own body” (Bri. Up. II.1.18).
In the sec ond place we no tice that dreams are in con flict with the
con di tions of time. One man who is sleep ing at night dreams that it is
day. An other man lives dur ing a dream which lasts for ten min utes
only, through fifty years. One man sees at night an eclipse of the sun
in his dream.
In the third place, the senses which alone can bring the sen sa -
tion of sight etc., are not func tion ing in dream. The or gans are drawn
in ward and the dream ing per son has no eyes to see char i ots and
other things. How can he get in the twin kling of an eye ma te ri als for
mak ing char i ots and the like?
In the fourth place the char i ots etc., dis ap pear on wak ing. The
char i ots etc., dis ap pear even in the course of the dream. The dream
it self re futes what it cre ates, as its end con tra dicts its be gin ning. The
char iot is sud denly trans ferred into a man, and a man into a tree.
Scrip ture it self clearly says that the char i ots, etc., of a dream
have no real ex is tence. “There are no char i ots in that state, no
horses, no roads, etc.”
Hence the vi sions in a dream are mere il lu sion.
The ar gu ment that the dream world is real, be cause it is also a
cre ation of the Su preme Lord like this wak ing world is not true, be -
cause the dream world is not the cre ation of the Lord, but of the in di -
vid ual soul. The Sruti de clares “When he dreams he him self puts the
phys i cal body aside and him self cre ates a dream body in its place”
(Bri. Up. IV.3.9.) This pas sage of the Sruti clearly proves that it is the
in di vid ual soul who cre ates the dream world and not the Lord.

**Suchakascha hi sruterachakshate cha tadvidah** III.2.4 ( 322 )

But (though the dream world is an illusion), yet it is indi cative
(of the future), for (so we find) in the Sruti, the dream-experts
also declare this.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 334
```

**Suchaka:** indicative, suggestive; **Cha:** moreover, and; **Hi:** because,

as for; **Sruteh:** from the Sruti; **Achakshate:** say, affirm; **Cha:** also;

**Tadvidah:** dream-experts, those who know the secrets of dream.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 3 is given.
The word ‘Tadvid’ or ex pert means those who know how to in ter -
pret dreams such as Vyasa, Brihaspati, and the rest.
Well then, as dreams are mere il lu sion, they do not con tain a
par ti cle of re al ity? Not so we re ply: be cause dreams are pro phetic of
fu ture good and bad for tune. For scrip ture says “When a man en -
gaged in some sac ri fice un der taken for a spe cial wish sees in his
dreams a woman, he may in fer suc cess from that dream-vi sion”
(Chh. Up. V.2.8). Other scrip tural pas sages de clare that cer tain
dreams in di cate speedy death, e.g., “If he sees a black man with
black teeth, that man will kill him.”
Those who un der stand the sci ence of dreams main tain that “to
dream of rid ing on an el e phant and the like is lucky while it is un lucky
to dream of rid ing on a don key.” “What ever a Brah min or a god, a bull
or a king may tell a per son in dream, will doubt less prove true.”
Some times one gets Mantras in dream. Lord Siva taught
Visvamitra in dream the Man tra called Ramaraksha. Visvamitra ex -
actly wrote it out in the morn ing, when he awoke from sleep.
In all these cases the thing in di cated may be real. The in di cat ing
dream how ever, re mains un real as it is re futed by the wak ing state.
The doc trine that the dream it self is mere il lu sion thus re mains un con -
tra dicted.
The word ‘cre ation’ in dream in the first Su tra is used in a sec -
ond ary and fig u ra tive sense. The soul’s good and bad deeds bring
about plea sure and pain en joyed dur ing dream, by means of
dream-ex pe ri ences. In the wak ing state the light of the soul op er ates
along with the light of the sun to bring about ex pe ri ences. The dream
state is re ferred to, to show the self-ac tiv ity of the soul even af ter the
senses are shut off and there is no op er a tion of ex ter nal light. It is this
fact that is the pri mary teach ing. The ref er ence to cre ation in dreams
is sec ond ary.
The world of dreams is not real in the same sense as the world
con sist ing of ether is real. We must re mem ber that the so-called real
cre ation with its ether, air, etc., is not ab so lutely real. The world of
ether, etc., van ishes into noth ing when the in di vid ual soul real ises its
iden tity with the Su preme Soul.
The dream-cre ation, how ever, is stul ti fied ev ery day. That the
dream is mere il lu sion has there fore to be un der stood very clearly
and de ci sively.

**Parabhidhyanattu tirohitam tato hyasya
bandhaviparyayau** III.2.5 ( 323 )

But by the meditation on the Supreme Lord, that which is
hidden (by ignorance, viz., the equality of the Lord and the soul
becomes manifest), because from him (the Lord) are its (the
soul’s) bondage and freedom.

**Parabhidhyanat:** by meditation on the Supreme Lord; **Tu:** but;
**Tirohitam:** that which is hidden; **Tatah:** from Him(the Lord); **Hi:** for;
**Asya:** his, of the individual soul; **Bandhaviparyayau:** bondage and
its opposite, i.e., freedom.

The Purvapakshin or the op po nent says: The in di vid ual soul is a
part (Amsa) of the Su preme Soul, just as a spark is a part of the fire.
Just as fire and spark have in com mon the pow ers of burn ing and giv -
ing light, so also the in di vid ual soul and the Lord have in com mon the
pow ers of knowl edge and rul er ship. There fore the in di vid ual soul may
by means of his lord ship cre ate in the dream ing state char i ots and the
like at will (Sankalpa) like the Lord.
This Su tra re futes it and says that the soul now is dif fer ent from
the Lord on ac count of Avidya or ig no rance. The rul er ship is hid den
by ig no rance in the Jiva state. It be comes man i fest only when in the
state of med i ta tion on the Lord. This ig no rance is dis pelled by the
knowl edge, “I am Brah man”, just as through the ac tion of a strong
med i cine the power of sight of the blind man be comes man i fest.
The Sruti de clares “when that God is known all fet ters fall off;
suf fer ings are de stroyed and birth and death cease. From med i tat ing
on Him there arises on the dis so lu tion of the body, a third state, that of
uni ver sal Lord ship; he who is alone is sat is fied” (Svet. Up. I. 1 1). Till
the knowl edge dawns the in di vid ual soul can not cre ate at will any -
thing real.
Lord ship does not come to man spon ta ne ously. It does not on its
own ac cord re veal it self to all men, as the bond age and free dom of
the in di vid ual soul come from the Lord. That means: from knowl edge
of Lord’s true na ture, i.e., from reali sa tion of God free dom co mes;
from ig no rance of His true na ture co mes bond age. Till such reali sa -
tion co mes, where is then any power of cre ation?

**Xoh`moJmÛm gmo@{n**

**Dehayogadva so’pi** III.2.6 ( 324 )
And that (viz., the concealment of the soul’s rulership) also
(results) from its connection with the body.

**Dehayogat:** from its connection with the body; **Va:** and, or; **Sah:** that
(the concealment of the soul’s rulership); **Api:** also.

```
Su tra 5 is am pli fied here.
```
```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 336
```

Such hid ing of power is due to em bodi ment of the soul. The
state of con ceal ment of the soul’s knowl edge and Lord ship is due to
its be ing joined to a body, i.e., to a body, sense-or gans, mind, in tel lect,
sense-ob jects, sen sa tions, etc., on ac count of ig no rance. Just as fire
is hid den in wood or ashes, the knowl edge and power of the soul are
hid den, though the Jiva is re ally the Su preme Lord. Hence the soul
does not it self cre ate. If it can, it will never cre ate un pleas ant dreams.
No one ever wishes for some thing un pleas ant to him self.
The soul’s knowl edge and Lord ship re main hid den as long as
he er ro ne ously thinks him self as the body, etc., as long as he is un der
the wrong no tion of not be ing dis tinct from those lim it ing ad juncts.
Sruti de clares that the soul is non-dif fer ent from the Lord. “It is
True, it is the Self, Thou art That, O Svetaketu!” But its knowl edge and
power are ob scured by its con nec tion with the body.
Though the dream-phe nom ena are like wak ing phe nom ena in
their hav ing rel a tive re al ity, the Sruti it self de clares that they do not re -
ally ex ist. As the dreams are due to Vasanas ac quired dur ing the wak -
ing state, the sim i lar ity be tween the dream state and the wak ing state
is de clared.
From all this it fol lows that dreams are mere il lu sion. They are
false.

The soul in dreamless sleep

**Tadabhavo nadishu tat sruteh atmani cha** III.2.7 ( 325 )

The absence of that (i.e., of dreams, i.e., dreamless sleep) takes
place in the nerves (Nadis or psychic currents) and in the self,
as it is known from the Sruti or scriptural statement.

**Tadabhavah:** absence of that (dreaming) i.e., deep sleep; **Nadishu:**
in the nerves (psychic currents); **Tat sruteh:** as it is known from the
Srutis; **Atmani:** in the self; **Cha:** and, also. ( **Tat:** about it.)

The state of dream less deep sleep is now dis cussed.
The state of dream has been dis cussed. We are now go ing to
en quire into the state of deep sleep (Sushupti).
Var i ous Sruti texts de scribe the soul as rest ing in deep sleep in
nerves (Nadis), in Prana, in the heart, in it self, in Brah man or the Ab -
so lute.
In dif fer ent Sruti pas sages deep sleep is said to take place un -
der dif fer ent con di tions.
“When a man is asleep re pos ing and at per fect rest so that he
sees no dreams, then he has en tered into these Nadis (nerves)”
(Chh. Up. VIII.6.3). In an other place it is said with ref er ence to the
Nadis, “Through them he moves forth and rests in the re gion of the

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 337
```

heart” (Bri. Up. II.1.19). In an other place it is said “In these the per son
is when sleep ing, he sees no dream. Then he be comes one with the
Prana alone” (Kau. Up. IV.19). In an other place it is said “That ether
which is within the heart in that he re poses” (Bri. Up. IV.4.22). In
Chhandogya Upanishad it is said, “Then he be comes united with that
which is, he is gone to his self” (Chh. Up. VI.8.1). In Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad it is said “Em braced by the high est Self he knows noth ing
that is with out, noth ing that is within” (Bri. Up. IV.3.21). “When this be -
ing full of con scious ness is asleep... lies in the ether, i.e., the real self
which is in the heart” (Bri. Up. II.1.17).
Here the doubt arises whether the Nadis, etc., men tioned in the
above pas sages are in de pend ent from each other and con sti tute var i -
ous places for the soul in the state of deep sleep or if they stand in mu -
tual re la tion so as to re fer to one place only.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent holds the for mer views on
ac count of the var i ous places men tioned serv ing one and the same
pur pose. Things which serve the same pur pose, e.g., rice and bar ley
do not de pend on each other. As all the words which stand for the
places enu mer ated are in the same case, viz., the locative case in the
texts, they are co or di nate and there fore al ter na tives. If mu tual re la tion
was meant then dif fer ent case-end ings would be used by the Sruti.
Hence we con clude that in the state of deep sleep the soul op tion ally
goes to any one of those places, ei ther the Nadis, or that which is, the
Prana, the heart, etc.
The Su tra re futes the view of the Purvapakshin and says that
they are to be taken as stand ing in mu tual re la tion in di cat ing the same
place. The view that the soul goes to one or an other of these is not
cor rect. The truth is that the soul goes through the nerves to the re -
gion of the heart and there rests in Brah man.
There is no al ter na tive here. The as ser tion made above that we
are com pelled to al low op tion be cause the Nadis, etc., serve one and
the same pur pose is with out foun da tion. The au thor ity of the Srutis is
weak ened if we al low op tion be tween two state ments of the Sruti. If
you re cog nise one al ter na tive, the au thor ity of the other al ter na tive is
de nied.
Fur ther the same case is used where things serve dif fer ent pur -
poses and have to be com bined. We say, e.g., “he sleeps in the pal -
ace, he sleeps on a cot.” We have to com bine the two locatives into
one as “He sleeps on a cot in the pal ace.” Even so the dif fer ent state -
ments have to be com bined into one. “The soul goes through the
Nadis to the re gion of the heart and then rests in Brah man.” Just as a
man goes along the Gan ga to the sea so also the soul goes through
the Nadis to Brah man. So he at tains Svarupa.
Scrip ture men tions only three places of deep sleep, viz., the
Nadis, the pericardium and Brah man. Among these three again Brah -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 338
```

man alone is the last ing place of deep sleep. The Nadis and the
pericardium, are mere roads lead ing to it. The ‘Puritat’ or pericardium
is the cov er ing which sur rounds the lo tus of the heart.
In deep sleep the in di vid ual soul rests in Brah man, but there is a
thin veil of ig no rance be tween him and the Su preme Soul. Hence he
has no di rect knowl edge of his iden tity with the Su preme Soul, as in
Nirvikalpa Sam adhi or superconscious state. The Sruti de clares “He
be comes united with the True, he is gone to his own (Self)” (Chh. Up.
VI.8).
In the Kaushitaki Upanishad (IV.19) the three places are men -
tioned to gether: “In these the per son is when sleep ing he sees no
dreams. Then he be comes one with the Prana (Brah man) alone”.
There fore Brah man is the rest ing place of the soul in deep
sleep.

**AV... à~moYmo@ñ_mV²Ÿ&**

**Atah prabodho’smat** III.2.8 ( 326 )

Hence the waking from that (viz., Brahman).

**Atah:** hence; **Prabodhah:** waking; **Asmat:** from this (i.e., Brahman).

The mode of wak ing from deep sleep is now de scribed.
There fore wak ing is com ing from that state of un ion with Brah -
man or At man.
Brah man is the place of re pose of deep sleep. That is the rea -
son why the Sruti texts which treat of deep sleep in vari ably teach that
in the wak ing state the in di vid ual soul re turns to wak ing con scious -
ness from Brah man. The Sruti de clares “In the same man ner, my
child, all these crea tures when they have come back from the True do
not know that they have come back from the True” (Chh. Up. VI.10.2).
This Sruti pas sage clearly in ti mates that the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul
re turns from the True or Brah man to the wak ing state and that the Jiva
rests or merges him self in Brah man and not in the Nadis, Hita, etc.,
dur ing deep sleep. But he does not real ise his iden tity with Brah man
in deep sleep as he is en vel oped by the evil of ig no rance.
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad also de clares “When the time co -
mes for the an swer to the ques tion ‘whence did he come back’?”
(II.1.16); the text says, “As small sparks come forth from fire, thus all
Pranas come forth from that Self” (II.1.20).
If there were op tional places, to which the soul may re sort, in
deep sleep, the Sruti would teach us that it awakes some times from
the Nadis, some times from the pericardium (Puritat), some times from
the Self (Brah man).
For this rea son also Brah man is the place of deep sleep. The
Nadis are only the gate way to Brah man.

Karmanusmritisabdavidhyadhikaranam: Topic 3
The same soul returns from deep sleep
```
**g Ed Vw H$_m©Zwñ_¥{VeãX{d{Yä`...Ÿ&**

**Sa eva tu karmanusmritisabdavidhibhyah** III.2.9 ( 327 )

But the same (soul returns from Brahman after deep sleep) on

account of work, remembrance, scriptural text and precept.

**Sah eva:** the selfsame soul (which went to sleep); **Tu:** but;

**Karmanusmritisabdavidhibhyah:** on account of Karma or work,

memory, scriptural authority and precept; ( **Sah:** he; **Eva:** only, and no

other); **Karma:** activity, on account of his finishing the action left

unfinished; **Anusmriti:** remembrance, on account of memory of

identity; **Sabda:** from the Sruti; **Vidhibhyah:** from the

commandments.

Here we have to en quire whether the soul when awak ing from
deep sleep is the same which en tered into un ion with Brah man or an -
other one.
The word ‘tu’ (but) re moves the doubt.
If an other self arose from sleep, the con scious ness of per sonal
iden tity (Atmanusmarana) ex pressed in the words “I am the same as I
was be fore” would not be pos si ble.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent holds that there is no fixed
rule on this point. There can be no rule that the same soul arises from
Brah man. When a drop of wa ter is poured into a big ba sin of wa ter, it
be comes one with the lat ter. When we again take out a drop it will be
dif fi cult to man age that it should be the very same drop. It is hard to
pick it out again. Even so when the in di vid ual soul has merged in
Brah man in deep sleep it is dif fi cult to say that the self-same Jiva
arises from Brah man af ter deep sleep. Hence some other soul arises
af ter deep sleep from Brah man.
This Su tra re futes this and says that the same soul which in the
state of deep sleep en tered Brah man again arises from Brah man, af -
ter deep sleep, not any other for the fol low ing rea sons.
The per son who wakes from sleep must be the same be cause
what has been partly done by a per son be fore go ing to sleep is fin -

text. There fore it is quite clear that it is one and the same man who fin -
ishes on the lat ter day the work be gun on the for mer.
He has also a sense of self-iden tity. He ex pe ri ences iden tity of
per son al ity be fore and af ter sleep, for if sleep leads to lib er a tion by
un ion with Brah man, sleep will be come the means of lib er a tion. Then
scrip tural in struc tions would be use less to at tain sal va tion. If the per -
son who goes to sleep is dif fer ent from the per son who rises af ter
sleep, then the com mand ments of the scrip tures with ref er ence to
work or knowl edge would be mean ing less or use less.
The per son ris ing from sleep is the same who went to sleep. If it
is not so he could not re mem ber what he had seen, etc., on the day
be fore, be cause what one man sees an other can not re mem ber. He
has mem ory of past events. One can not re mem ber what an other felt.
He has mem ory or rec ol lec tion in the shape of “I am the per son who
had gone to sleep and who have now awak ened.”
The Sruti texts de clare that the same per son rises again. “He
has tens back again as he came to the place from which he started, to
be awake” (Bri. Up. IV.3.16). “All these crea tures go day af ter day into
Brah man and yet do not dis cover Him” (Chh. Up. VIII.3.2). “What ever
these crea tures are here whether a ti ger, or a lion, or a wolf, or a boar,
or a worm, or a midge or a gnat, or a mos quito, that they be come
again” (Chh. Up. VI.10.2). These and sim i lar texts which ap pear in the
chap ters which deal with sleep ing and wak ing have a proper sense
only if the self-same soul rises again.
More over, if it is not the same soul, Karma and Avidya will have
no pur pose.
There fore from all this it fol lows that the per son ris ing from sleep
is the same that went to sleep.
The case of the drop of wa ter is not quite anal o gous, be cause a
drop of wa ter merges in the ba sin of wa ter with out any ad juncts.
There fore it is lost for ever but the in di vid ual soul merges in Brah man
with its ad juncts (viz., body, mind, in tel lect, Prana, sense). So the
same Jiva rises again from Brah man on ac count of the force of Karma
and de sire.
When the in di vid ual soul en ters Brah man in deep sleep, he en -
ters like a pot full of salt wa ter with cov ered mouth plunged into the
Gan ga. When he awak ens from sleep it is the same pot taken out of
the river with the same wa ter in it. Sim i larly the in di vid ual soul en vel -
oped by his de sires goes to sleep and for the time be ing puts off all
sense-ac tiv i ties and goes to the rest ing place namely, the Su preme
Brah man and again co mes out of it in or der to get fur ther ex pe ri -
ences. He does not be come iden ti cal with Brah man like the per son
who has ob tained lib er a tion. Thus we hear that the same soul which
had gone to sleep awakes again into the same body.

Hence it is an es tab lished fact that the same soul awakes from
deep sleep.

Mugdhe’rdhasampattyadhikaranam: Topic 4
The nature of swoon
```
**_w½Yo@Õ©gån{Îm... n[aeofmV²Ÿ&**

**Mugdhe’rdhasampattih pariseshat** III.2.10 (328)
In a swoon (in him who is senseless) there is half union on
account of this remaining (as the only alternative left, as the
only possible hypothesis).

**Mugdhe:** in a swoon; **Ardhasampattih:** partial attainment of the
state of deep sleep or death; **Pariseshat:** on account of the
remaining, because of excess, as it is a state in addition to all others.

The state of a swoon is now dis cussed.
The Purvapakshin says, “There are only three states of a soul
while liv ing in the body, viz., wak ing, dream ing and deep sleep. The
soul’s pass ing out of the body is the fourth state or death. The state of
swoon can not be taken as a fifth state. A fifth state is known nei ther
from Sruti nor Smriti.”
What is swoon then? Is it a sep a rate state of the soul or is it only
one of these states?
It can not be wak ing, be cause he does not per ceive ex ter nal ob -
jects, by the senses.
May this case be sim i lar to that of the ar row-maker? Just as the
man work ing in the prep a ra tion of an ar row, al though awake, is so ab -
sorbed in his work that he per ceives noth ing else, so also the man
who is stunned by a blow may be awake but may not per ceive any -
thing else as his mind is con cen trated on the sen sa tion of pain
caused by the blow of a stick.
No, we re ply. The case is dif fer ent ow ing to the ab sence of con -
scious ness. The ar row-maker says, “I was not con scious of any thing
but the ar row for such a length of time.” The man who re turns to con -
scious ness from a swoon says, “I was con scious of noth ing. I was
shut up in blind dark ness for such a length of time.” A man who is wak -
ing keeps his body straight or up right but the body of a swoon ing per -
son falls pros trate on the ground. There fore a man in a swoon is not
awake.
He is not dream ing, be cause he is to tally un con scious.
It is not deep sleep be cause there is hap pi ness in deep sleep
whereas there is no hap pi ness in the state of swoon.
He is not dead also, be cause he con tin ues to breathe and his
body is warm. When a man has be come sense less and when peo ple
are in doubt whether he is alive or dead, they touch the re gion of his
heart in or der to find out whether there is warmth in his body or not.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 342
```

They place their hands to his nos trils to find out whether there is
breath ing or not. If they do not per ceive warmth or breath they come
to the con clu sion that he is dead and take his body to the cre ma to rium
to burn it. If there are warmth and breath ing they con clude that he is
not dead. They sprin kle cold wa ter on his face so that he may come
back to con scious ness.
The man who has swooned away is not dead, be cause he co -
mes back to con scious ness af ter some time.
Let us then say that a man who has swooned lies in deep sleep
as he is un con scious and at the same time not dead. No, we re ply.
This is also not pos si ble ow ing to the dif fer ent char ac ter is tics of the
two states.
A man who has swooned does some times not breathe for a long
time. His body shakes or trem bles. His face is dread ful. His eyes are
star ing wide open. But a sleep ing man looks calm, peace ful and
happy.
He draws his breath at reg u lar in ter vals. His eyes are closed.
His body does not trem ble. A sleep ing man may be waked by a gen tle
strok ing with the hand. He who is ly ing in a state of swoon can not be
wak ened even by a blow with a stick. Swoon is due to ex ter nal causes
such as blow on the head with a stick, etc., while sleep is due to fa -
tigue or wea ri ness.
Swoon is only half-un ion. The man in the state of swoon be longs
with one half to the side of deep sleep, with the other half to the side of
the other state, i.e., death. It is only half sleep. We do not mean by this
that he half en joys Brah man. We mean that it partly re sem bles sleep.
It is half death, a state al most bor der ing upon death. In fact it is the
door to death. If there is a rem nant of Karma he re turns to con scious -
ness. Else, he dies.
The man in the state of swoon be longs with one half to the side
of deep sleep, with the other half to the side of the other state, i.e.,
death.
Those who know Brah man say that swoon is half-un ion. In a
swoon the per son par tially at tains the state of deep sleep as there is
no con scious ness in that state and he re turns to con scious ness and
par tially the state of death as he ex pe ri ences pain and mis ery which
are ex pressed through dis tor tion of face and limbs.
The ob jec tion that no fifth state is com monly ac knowl edged is
with out much weight, be cause as that state oc curs oc ca sion ally only
it may not be gen er ally known. All the same it is known from or di nary
ex pe ri ence as well as from the sci ence of Ayurveda. It is a sep a rate
state, though it hap pens oc ca sion ally. As it is a mix ture of the two
states, viz., deep sleep and death it is not con sid ered as a fifth state.

The nature of Brahman

**Na sthanato’pi parasyobhayalingam sarvatra hi** III.2.11 (329)

Not on account of (difference of) place also two-fold

characteristics can belong to the Highest; for everywhere

(scripture teaches It to be without any difference).

**Na:** not; **Sthanatah:** on account of (difference of) place; **Api:** even;
**Parasya:** of the Highest (i.e., Brahman); **Ubhayalingam:** two-fold
characteristics; **Sarvatra:** everywhere; **Hi:** because.

The Sutrakara now pro ceeds to deal with the na ture of Brah -
man.
In the scrip tures we find two kinds of de scrip tion about Brah -
man. Some texts de scribe it as qual i fied, i.e., with at trib utes and some
as un qual i fied (with out at trib utes). “From whom all ac tiv i ties, all de -
sires, all odours and all tastes pro ceed” (Chh. Up. III.14.2). This text
speaks of at trib utes. Again, “It is nei ther coarse nor fine, nei ther short
nor long, nei ther red ness nor vis cid” etc. (Bri. Up. III.8.8). This text
speaks of Brah man with out at trib utes.
Are we to as sume that both are true of Brah man ac cord ing as it
is or is not con nected with lim it ing ad juncts or Upadhis or have we to
as sume only one of them as true and the other false? and if so, which
is true? and why it is true?
This Su tra says that the High est Brah man can not by it self pos -
sess dou ble char ac ter is tics. In the case of Brah man you can not say
that it has two as pects, viz., with form and at trib utes, and with out form
and at trib utes, i.e., with Upadhis (lim it ing ad juncts) and with out
Upadhis, be cause It is de scribed ev ery where as be ing Nirguna (with -
out at trib utes).
Both can not be pred i cated of one and the same Brah man be -
cause it is against ex pe ri ence. One and the same thing can not have
two con tra dic tory na tures at the same time. Brah man can not at the
same time have form and be form less.
The red ness of a flower re flected in a crys tal does not change
the na ture of the crys tal which is colour less. Even so the mere con -
nec tion of a thing with an other does not change its na ture. It is an al to -
gether er ro ne ous no tion to im pute red ness to the crys tal. The
red ness of the crys tal is un real. A thing can not change its real na ture.
Changes of its real na ture means an ni hi la tion. Sim i larly in the case of
Brah man, its con nec tion with the lim it ing ad juncts like earth, etc., is
due to ig no rance. An Upadhi can not af fect the na ture of Brah man,
such Upadhi be ing merely due to Avidya or ne science. The es sen tial
char ac ter of a thing must al ways re main the same what ever may be

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 344
```

the con di tions im posed on it. If how ever it ap pears to be al tered it is
surely due to ig no rance.
There fore we have to ac cept that Brah man is with out at trib utes,
be cause all Sruti texts whose aim is to rep re sent the na ture of Brah -
man such as “It is with out sound, with out touch, with out form, with out
de cay” (Katha Up. I.3.15) teach that It is free from all at trib utes.
Brah man with at trib utes is only for the sake of Upasana or pi ous
wor ship of dev o tees; it is not Its real na ture.

**Z ^oXm{X{V MoÞ àË`oH$_VÛMZmV²Ÿ&**

**Na bhedaditi chenna pratyekamatadvachanat** III.2.12 (330)

If it be said that it is not so on account of difference (being
taught in the scriptures), we reply that it is not so, because
with reference to each (such form), the Sruti declares the
opposite of that.

**Na:** not so; **Bhedat:** on account of difference (being taught in the
scrip tures); **Iti:** thus, as, so, this; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not so; **Pratyekam:** with
refe rence to each; **Atadvachanat:** because of the declaration of
opposite of that. ( **Atad:** absence of that; **Vachanat:** on account of the
statement.)

An ob jec tion to the pre ced ing Su tra is raised and re futed.
This Su tra con sists of two parts namely an ob jec tion and its re -
ply. The ob jec tion por tion is “ _Bhedat iti chet_ ” and the re ply por tion is
“ _Na pratyekamatadvachanat_ ”.
The Purvapakshin says, “The var i ous Vidyas teach dif fer ent
forms of Brah man. It is said to have four feet (Chh. Up. III.18.2); to
con sist of six teen parts or Kalas (Pras. Up. VI.1); to be char ac ter ised
by dwarf ish ness (Katha Up. V.3); to have the three worlds for its body
(Bri. Up. I.3.22); to be named Vaisvanara (Chh. Up. V.11.2), etc.
Hence we must ad mit that Brah man is also qual i fied.”
This Su tra re futes it and de clares that ev ery such form due to
lim it ing ad junct is de nied of Brah man in texts like “This bright, im mor -
tal be ing who is in this earth and that bright im mor tal cor po real be ing
in the body are but the self” (Bri. Up. II.5.1). Such texts clearly in di cate
that the same self is pres ent in all lim it ing ad juncts like earth, etc.
There fore there is only one ness. It, there fore can not be main tained
that the con cep tion of Brah man with var i ous forms is taught by the
Vedas.
In ev ery pas sage iden tity is also af firmed. The Su preme Truth is
one ness. Sep a rate ness is for de vo tion. The Sruti de clares that the
form is not true and that there is only one form less es sence or prin ci -
ple in re al ity.

CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 345
```

Moreover some (teach) thus.

**Api:** also; **Cha:** moreover, and; **Evam:** thus; **Eke:** some.

A fur ther ar gu ment is given in sup port of Su tra 11.
Some Sakhas or recensions of the Vedas di rectly teach that the
manifoldness is not true. They pass a crit i cal re mark on those who
see dif fer ence, “He goes from death to death who sees dif fer ence, as
it were, in it” (Katha Up. I.4.11). “By the mind alone it is to be per -
ceived. There is no di ver sity in It. He who per ceives therein any di ver -
sity goes from death to death” (Bri. Up. IV.4.19).
Oth ers also “By know ing the enjoyer, the en joyed, and the ruler,
ev ery thing has been de clared to be three-fold and this is Brah man”
(Svet. Up. I.12), say that the en tire world char ac ter ised by enjoyers,
things to be en joyed and a ruler has Brah man for its true na ture.

**Aê$ndXod {h VËàYmZËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Arupavadeva hi tatpradhanatvat** III.2.14 (332)

Verily Brahman is only formless on account of that being the

main purport (of all texts about Brahman).

**Arupavat:** without form, formless; **Eva:** only, indeed, decidedly; **Hi:**
verily, certainly, because; **Tatpradhanatvat:** on account of that being
the main purport of scripture. ( **Tat:** of that; **Pradhanatvat:** on account
of being the chief thing.)

A fur ther ar gu ment is given in sup port of Su tra 11.
We must def i nitely as sert that Brah man is form less and so on.
Why? On ac count of this be ing the main pur port of scrip tures. The
scrip tures de clare,“It is nei ther coarse nor fine, nei ther short nor long”
(Bri. Up. III.8.8). “That which is with out sound, with out form, with out
de cay” (Katha Up. I.3.15). “He who is called ether is the revealer of all
names and forms. That within which names and forms are, that is
Brah man” (Chh. Up. VIII.14.1). “That heav enly Per son is with out
body, He is both within and with out, not pro duced” (Mun. Up. II.1.2).
“That Brah man is with out cause, and with out any thing in side or out -
side, this self is Brah man, Om ni pres ent and Om ni scient” (Bri. Up.
II.5.19).
These texts aim at teach ing Brah man, de scribe It as form less. If
Brah man be un der stood to have a form then the scrip tural pas sages
which de scribe it as form less would be come mean ing less. The scrip -
tures have a pur port all through out. On the con trary, the other pas -
sages which re fer to a Brah man qual i fied by form do not aim at set ting
forth the na ture of Brah man but rather at en joy ing the wor ship of
Brah man.
There fore Brah man is form less.
As long as those lat ter texts do not con tra dict those of the for mer
class they are to be ac cepted as they stand; where, how ever, con tra -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 346
```

dic tions oc cur, the texts whose main pur port is Brah man must be
viewed as hav ing greater force than those of the other kind. This is the
rea son for our de cid ing that, al though there are two dif fer ent classes
of scrip tural texts, Brah man must be held to be al to gether form less,
not at the same time of an op po site na ture. The main Sruti texts de -
clare Brah man to be form less.
The col our and forms are the prod ucts of the el e ments and
Brah man is far above the in flu ence of and dif fer ent from the el e ments.
Hence He is called the colour less or form less. Ma te rial col our and
form can not be found in Him when He is far above the sub tle ma te rial
cause as well as above its pre sid ing de ity.

**àH$medƒmd¡`Ï`m©V²Ÿ&**

**Prakasavacchavaiyarthyat** III.2.15 (333)

And as light (assumes forms as it were by its contact with
things possessing form, so does Brahman take form in
connec tion with Upadhis or limiting adjuncts), because (texts
which ascribe form to Brahman) are not meaningless.

**Prakasavat:** like the light; **Cha:** and, moreover; **Avaiyarthyat:**
because of not being meaningless.

A fur ther ar gu ment is given in sup port of Su tra 11.
The word ‘Cha’ (and) is em ployed to re move the doubt raised
above.
If Brah man is form less then all the scrip tural texts which treat of
Brah man with form would be mean ing less, and su per flu ous. Then all
Upasanas of Brah man with form would be use less. How can the wor -
ship of such a false Brah man lead to Brahmaloka?
This Su tra ex plains that they also have a pur pose. The light of
the sun has no form but it ap pears to be great or small ac cord ing to
the hole through which it en ters a room and yet has the force of dis -
pel ling the dark ness in the room. Sim i larly Brah man which is with out a
form ap pears to have a form due to lim it ing ad juncts like earth, body,
etc. Just as the light of the sun co mes in con tact with a fin ger or some
other lim it ing ad junct and ac cord ing as the lat ter is straight or bent, it -
self be comes straight or bent as it were, so also Brah man as sumes,
as it were, the form of the earth, and the lim it ing ad juncts with which it
co mes into con tact. The wor ship of such an il lu sory Brah man can
help one to at tain Brahmaloka which is also il lu sory from the
view-point of the Ab so lute.
There fore these texts are not mean ing less. They have cer tainly
a pur port. All parts of the Veda are equally au thor i ta tive and there fore
must all be as sumed to have a mean ing or pur pose.
This, how ever, does not con tra dict the tenet main tained above,
viz., that Brah man though con nected with lim it ing ad juncts does not
pos sess dou ble char ac ter is tics, be cause what is merely due to a lim -

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 347

it ing ad junct can not con sti tute an at tri b ute of a sub stance. Fur ther the
lim it ing ad juncts are all due to ig no rance.

**Amh M VÝ_mÌ_²Ÿ&**

**Aha cha tanmatram** III.2.16 (334)

And (the Sruti) declares (that Brahman is) that (i.e.,
intelligence) only.

**Aha:** (the Sruti) declares; **Cha:** and, moreover; **Tanmatram:** that
(i.e., intelligent) only.

The force of the word ‘Matra’ in Tanmatra is to de note ex clu sive -
ness.
Scrip ture de clares that Brah man con sists of in tel li gence. “As a
lump of salt has nei ther in side nor out side, but is al to ge ther a mass of
saltish taste, thus in deed has that Self nei ther in side nor out side but is
al to gether a mass of knowl edge” (Bri. Up. IV.3.13). Pure in tel li gence
con sti tutes its na ture. Just as a lump of salt has nei ther in side nor out -
side but one and the same saltish taste, not any other taste, so also
Brah man has nei ther in side nor out side any char ac ter is tic form but in -
tel li gence.

**Darsayati chatho api smaryate** III.2.17 (335)
(The scripture) also shows (this and) it is likewise stated in
Smriti.

**Darsayati:** (the scripture or Sruti) shows; **Cha:** and, also; **Atho:** thus,
moreover; **Api:** also; **Smaryate:** the Smritis declare or state.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 11 is con tin ued.
That Brah man is with out any at trib utes is also proved by those
scrip tural texts also which ex pressly deny that It pos sesses any other
char ac ter is tics, e.g., “Now, there fore, the de scrip tion of Brah man; not
this, not this ( _neti, neti_ )” (Bri. Up. II.3.6). There is no other and more
ap pro pri ate de scrip tion than this “not this, not this”.
Kenopanishad (I.4) de clares “It is dif fer ent from the known, It is
also above the un known”. Taittiriya Upanishad (II.9) says “From
whence all speech, with the mind, turns away un able to reach it”.
The Sruti text which treats of the con ver sa tion be tween Bahva
and Vashkali has a sim i lar pur port. Vashkali ques tioned Bahva about
the na ture of Brah man. Bahva ex plained it to Vashkali by si lence.
Bahva said to Vashkali “Learn Brah man, O friend” and be came si lent.
Then on a sec ond and third ques tion he re plied “I am teach ing you in -
deed, but you do not un der stand. That Brah man is Si lence.”
If Brah man has form, there is no ne ces sity to deny ev ery thing
and say “Not this, not this.”

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 348
```

The same teach ing is con veyed by those Smriti texts which
deny of Brah man all other char ac ter is tics, e.g., “I will pro claim that
which is the ob ject of knowl edge, know ing which one at tains im mor -
tal ity; the High est Brah man with out ei ther be gin ning or end, which
can not be said ei ther to be or not to be” (Gita XIII.12). “It is
unmanifest, un think able, and with out mod i fi ca tion, thus It is spo ken
of” (Gita II. 25).
Of a sim i lar pur pose is an other Smriti text. Lord Hari in structed
Narada “The cause, O Narada, of your see ing Me en dowed with the
qual i ties of all be ings is the Maya thrown out by Me; do not cog nise
Me as be ing such in re al ity.”

**AW Ed Mmon_m gy`©H$m{XdV²Ÿ&**

**Ata eva chopama suryakadivat** III.2.18 (336)

For this very reason (we have with respect to Brahman)
comparisons like the images of the sun and the like.

**Ata eva:** for this very reason; therefore; **Cha:** also, and; **Upama:**
compa rison; **Suryakadivat:** like the images of the sun and the like.

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 11 is con tin ued.
That Brah man is form less is fur ther es tab lished from the sim i les
used with re spect to It. As Brah man is of the na ture of in tel li gence, de -
void of all dif fer ence, tran scend ing speech and mind, as He is form -
less, ho mo ge neous and as He is de scribed only by de ny ing of Him all
other char ac ter is tics, the scrip tures com pare His forms to the im ages
of the sun re flected in the wa ter and the like, mean ing thereby that
these forms are un real be ing due only to lim it ing ad juncts. “As the one
lu mi nous sun en ters into re la tion to many dif fer ent wa ters is him self
ren dered mul ti form by his lim it ing ad juncts; so also the one un born
Brah man ap pears dif fer ent in dif fer ent bod ies.”

because of non-acceptance, because it cannot be accepted, not
being experienced; **Tu:** but; **Na:** not, no; **Tathatvam:** that nature,

It is not a ma te rial thing. All are iden ti cal with it. There are no lim -

Brah man is all-per vad ing. So no ob ject can be at a dis tance

wa ter. But there can be no such dis tance be tween Brah man and any

**Vriddhihrasabhaktvamantarbhavadubhaya-
samanjasyadevam** III.2.20 (338)

As (the highest Brahman) is inside (its limiting adjuncts) It
participates in their increase and decrease; owing to the
appropriateness (thus resulting) of the two (things compared),
it is thus, (i.e., the comparison holds good).

**Vriddhihrasabhaktvam:** participating in the increase and decrease;
**Antarbhavat:** on account of its being inside; **Ubhaya-samanjasyat:**
on account of the appropriateness in the two cases; **Evam:** thus.
( **Vriddhi:** increase; Hrasa: decrease; **Ubhaya:** towards both;
**Samanjasyat:** because of the justness, appropriateness.)

The ob jec tion raised in the pre ced ing Su tra is re futed.
The com par i son with the re flec tion of the sun should not be
taken on all fours. When ever two things are com pared they are so
only with ref er ence to some par tic u lar point or fea ture they have in
com mon. En tire equal ity of the two can never be dem on strated. If it
could be shown, there would be an end of that par tic u lar re la tion
which gives rise to the com par i son. Ex act si mil i tude in all points would
mean ab so lute iden tity.
The sim i lar ity is only in point of the par tic i pa tion in the dis tor tion
and con tor tion in in crease and de crease of the im age or re flec tion.
The re flected im age of the sun di lates when the sur face of the wa ter
ex pands; it con tracts when the wa ter shrinks; it trem bles when the
wa ter is ag i tated; it di vides it self when the wa ter is di vided. It thus par -
tic i pates in all the at trib utes and con di tions of the wa ter; while the real
sun re mains all the time the same.
Even so Brah man al though in re al ity uni form and never chang -
ing, par tic i pates as it were in the at trib utes and states of the body and
the other lim it ing ad juncts within which It abides. It grows with them as

```

it were, de creases with them as it were and so on. As the two things
com pared pos sess cer tain com mon fea tures, no ob jec tion can be
made to the com par i son. The com par i son is cer tainly not de fec tive on
ac count of the above sim i lar ity in the two cases.

**Xe©ZmƒŸ&**

**Darsanaccha** III.2.21 (339)

And on account of the declaration of scripture.

**Darsanat:** as it is found to be so, because it is seen, on account of
scrip tural declaration; **Cha:** and, also.

A fur ther rea son is given to re fute the ob jec tion raised in
Sutra 19.
The scrip ture more over de clares that the Su preme Brah man
en ters into the body and other lim it ing ad juncts. “He made bod ies with
two feet, He made bod ies with four feet. That High est Brah man first
en tered the bod ies as a bird. He is called the Purusha on ac count of
His dwell ing in all bod ies” (Bri. Up. II.5.18). “Hav ing en tered into them
with this lur ing in di vid ual self” (Chh. Up. VI.3.2). For all these rea sons
the com par i son set forth in Su tra 18 is not de fec tive.
There fore it is es tab lished that Brah man is form less, ho mo ge -
neous, of the na ture of in tel li gence, and with out any dif fer ence.
Scrip ture de clares that de vout med i ta tions on Brah man with
form have re sults of their own viz., ei ther the ward ing off of ca lam i ties,
or the gain ing of power, or else re lease by suc ces sive steps (Krama

What has been mentioned up to this is denied (by the words

( **Prakrita:** mentioned first, previously stated; **Etavattvam:** this much.)

In this group of Sutras also the Sutrakara ex pounds the
Nirvisesha (form less) Brah man.
The Sruti de clares “There are two forms of Brah man, gross and
sub tle, the ma te rial and the im ma te rial, the mor tal and the im mor tal,
the lim ited and the un lim ited, Sat and Tyat” (Bri. Up. II.3.1).

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 351
```

Af ter de scrib ing the two forms of Brah man, the gross con sist ing
of earth, wa ter and fire, and the sub tle, con sist ing of air and ether, the
Sruti de clares fi nally “Now, there fore, the de scrip tion of Brah man; not
this, not this” (Bri. Up. II.3.6).
There arises a doubt whether the dou ble de nial in “not this, not
this” ne gates both the world and Brah man, or only one of them.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains that both are de -
nied and con se quently Brah man which is false, can not be the sub -
stra tum for a uni verse which is also false. It leads us to Sunyavada. If
one only is de nied it is proper that Brah man is de nied, be cause It is
not seen and there fore Its ex is tence is doubt ful and not the uni verse
be cause we ex pe ri ence it.
This Su tra re futes this view of the Purvapakshin. It is im pos si ble
that the phrase “Not so, not so” should neg a tive both, as that would
im ply the doc trine of a gen eral void. The words “Neti, Neti” can not be
said to deny Brah man as well as its hav ing form, be cause that would
be Sunyavada.
The Sruti af firms Brah man. What is the good of teach ing Brah -
man and say ing that it is non-ex is tent? Why smear your self with mud
and then wash it? So Brah man is be yond speech and mind and is
eter nal, pure and free. It is a mass of con scious ness. There fore the
Sruti de nies that Brah man has form but not Brah man it self.
What has been de scribed till now, viz., the two forms of Brah -
man: gross and sub tle, is de nied by the words, “not this, not this”.
Brah man can not be de nied, be cause that would con tra dict the
in tro duc tory phrase of the Chap ter. “Shall I tell you Brah man?” (Bri.
Up. II.1.1), would show dis re gard of the threat con veyed in Tait. Up.
II.6. “He who knows the Brah man as non-ex ist ing be comes him self
non-ex ist ing,” would be op posed to def i nite as ser tions such as “He is”
“He is to be ap pre hended” (Katha Up. II.6.13); and would cer tainly in -
volve a stul ti fi ca tion of the whole Vedanta.
The phrase that Brah man tran scends all speech and thought
does cer tainly not mean to say that Brah man does not ex ist, be cause
af ter the Sruti has es tab lished the ex is tence of Brah man in such texts
as “He who knows Brah man ob tains the High est”, “Truth, Knowl edge,
In fin ity is Brah man”. It can not be sup posed all at once to teach its
non-ex is tence. Be cause the com mon say ing is “Better than bath ing it
is not to touch dirt at all.” The Sruti text “From whence all speech with
the mind turns away un able to reach it” (Tait. Up. II.4), must there fore
be viewed as in ti mat ing Brah man.
“Not so, not so” neg a tives the en tire ag gre gate of ef fects su per -
im posed on Brah man, but not Brah man which is the ba sis for all fic ti -
tious su per im po si tions. It de nies of Brah man the lim ited form,
ma te rial as well as im ma te rial which in the pre ced ing part of the chap -
ter is de scribed with ref er ence to the gods as well as the body, and

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 352
```

also the sec ond form which is pro duced by the first, is char ac ter ised
by men tal im pres sions, forms the es sence of that which is im ma te rial,
is de noted by the term Purusha.
The dou ble rep e ti tion of the ne ga tion may ei ther serve the pur -
pose of fur nish ing spe cial de nial of the ma te rial as well as the im ma -
te rial form of Brah man; or the first ‘not so’ may neg a tive the ag gre gate
of ma te rial el e ments, while the sec ond de nies the ag gre gate of men -
tal im pres sions. Or else the rep e ti tion may be an em phatic one, in ti -
mat ing that what ever can be thought is not Brah man.
The Sruti de nies that Brah man has form but not Brah man it self.
It in ter dicts by two ne ga tions the gross and the sub tle bod ies. Or it in -
ter dicts Bhutas (el e ments) and Vasanas. Or the rep e ti tion is for stat -
ing the de nial of all sim i lar as sump tions. So the de nial de nies the
world as su per im posed on Brah man and does not deny Brah man it -
self.
Af ter the ne ga tion of Neti Neti, the Sruti goes on to de scribe in
pos i tive terms the fur ther at trib utes of this Brah man—His name be ing
the True of the true ( _Satyasya Satyam_ ). More over af ter mak ing such a
de nial, it af firms the ex is tence of some thing higher— _Anyat
Paramasti; Satyasya Satyam_ —The Truth of Truth. This in ti mates that
Brah man alone is the one re al ity that ex ists and is the sub stra tum of
the world which is il lu sory.
‘Neti Neti’ de nies the so-much ness of Brah man, as was de -
scribed in the pre ced ing Sutras. It says that the ma te rial and im ma te -
rial is not the whole of Brah man. It is some thing more than that. The
word ‘Iti’ re fers to what has been men tioned im me di ately be fore, i.e.,
the two forms of Brah man, the sub ject mat ter of the dis cus sion.
Hence it can not re fer to Brah man it self which is not the chief topic of
the pre ced ing texts.
The ob jec tion viz., Brah man is not ex pe ri enced and there fore it
is Brah man that is de nied, has no force. It can not stand, be cause the
ob ject of the Sruti is to teach about some thing which is not or di narily
ex pe ri enced by us. Oth er wise its teach ing would be su per flu ous.
We, there fore, de cide that the clause “not so, not so”, neg a tives
not ab so lutely ev ery thing, but only ev ery thing but Brah man.

CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 353
```

Brah man is be yond the senses, so the Sruti de clares. If Brah -
man ex ists, then why is It not ap pre hended by the senses or the
mind? Be cause It is ex tremely sub tle and is the wit ness of what ever is
ap pre hended i.e., sub ject in the ap pre hen sion. The in di vid ual souls
are en vel oped by ig no rance. Hence they are not able to per ceive
Brah man. The Sruti de clares “Brah man is not ap pre hended by the
eye, nor by the speech, nor by the other senses, nor by pen ance, nor
by good works” (Mun. Up. III.1). “That Self is to be de scribed by no,
no! He is in com pre hen si ble, for He can not be com pre hended” (Bri.
Up. III.9.26). “That which can not be seen nor ap pre hended” (Mun.
Up. I.1.6).
“When in that which is in vis i ble, in cor po real, un de fined, un sup -
ported” (Tait. Up. II.7). Sim i lar state ments are made in Smriti pas -
sages, e.g., “He is called un evolved, not to be fath omed by thought,
un change able.”

**A{n M g§amYZo àË`jmZw_mZä`m_²Ÿ&**

**Api cha samradhane pratyakshanumanabhyam** III.2.24 (342)

And moreover (Brahman is experienced) in devout medita tion
(as we know) from the Sruti and Smriti.

**Api cha:** and moreover; **Samradhane:** in devout meditation;
**Pratyakshanumanabhyam:** from the Sruti and the Smriti.

The dis cus sion on the char ac ter is tic of Brah man is con tin ued.
The word ‘Api’ sets aside the Purvapaksha. It is used in a
deprecative sense. The above Purvapaksha is not even wor thy of
con sid er ation.
Brah man is ex ceed ingly sub tle. Hence He can not be seen by
the phys i cal eyes. He is be yond the senses. But Yo gis be hold Him in
their pu ri fied minds. If Brah man is not man i fest, then we can never
know Him and there fore there will be no free dom.
This Su tra de clares that Brah man is not known only to those
whose heart is not pu ri fied, but those who are en dowed with a pure
heart real ise Brah man in the state of Sam adhi when ig no rance is an -
ni hi lated.
This is vouched for by Srutis as well as Smritis. “The Self-ex is -
tent cre ated the senses with out-go ing ten den cies. There fore man
be holds the ex ter nal uni verse but not the in ter nal Self. Some wise
man, how ever, with his eyes closed and wish ing for im mor tal ity be -
holds the Self within” (Katha Up. IV.1). “When a man’s mind has be -
come pu ri fied by the se rene light of knowl edge, then he sees Him,
med i tat ing on Him as with out parts” (Mun. Up. III.1.8).
The Smriti also says the same thing “He who is seen as light by
the Yogins med i tat ing on Him sleep lessly, with sus pended breath,

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 354
```

with con tented minds and sub dued senses, etc., rev er ence be to
Him” and “the Yogins see Him, the au gust, eter nal one!”

**Prakasadivacchavaiseshyam prakasascha
karmanyabhyasat** III.2.25 (343)
And as in the case of (physical) light and the like, there is no
difference, so also between Brahman and Its manifestation in
activity; on account of the repeated instruction (of the Sruti to
that effect).

**Prakasadivat:** like light and the like; **Cha:** also, and; **Avaiseshyam:**
simi larity, non-difference, non-distinction; **Prakasah:** Brahman; **Cha:**
and; **Karmani:** in work; **Abhyasat:** on account of repeated mention
(in the Sruti).

The dis cus sion on the char ac ter of Brah man is con tin ued.
The iden tity of Jiva and Brah man is ex plained. Just as light,
ether, the sun, etc., ap pear dif fer en ti ated as it were, through their ob -
jects such as fin gers, ves sels, wa ter, etc., which form the lim it ing ad -
juncts while in re al ity they pre serve their es sen tial non-dif fer ence, so
also the dis tinc tion of dif fe r ent selves is due to lim it ing ad juncts only,
while the unity of all selves is nat u ral and orig i nal. Through ig no rance
the in di vi d ual soul thinks he is dif fer ent from Brah man, but in re al ity he
is iden ti cal with Brah man.
As in the case of light, etc., the self-lu mi nous Brah man ap pears
di verse in med i ta tion and other acts. This is clear from the Sruti say -
ing “ _Tat Tvam Asi_ ” nine times.
The Vedanta texts in sist again and again on the doc trine of the
non-dif fer ence of the in di vid ual soul and the Su preme Soul. The iden -
tity of the in di vid ual soul with the Su preme Soul is known from re -
peated in struc tion of the Sruti in texts like “That Thou art— _Tat Tvam
Asi_ ”, “I am Brah man— _Aham Brahma Asmi_ ” which deny dif fer ence.

**AVmo@ZÝVoZ VWm {h {b“_²Ÿ&**

**Ato’nantena tatha hi lingam** III.2.26 (344)
Therefore (the individual soul becomes one) with the Infinite;
for thus the (scripture) indicates.

**Atah:** hence, therefore; **Anantena:** with the Infinite; **Tatha:** thus; **Hi:**
because, for; **Lingam:** the indication (of the scriptures).

The re sult of reali sa tion of Brah man is stated here.
By the reali sa tion of Brah man the meditator be comes iden ti cal
with the In fi nite. Ig no rance with all its lim it ing ad juncts van ishes when
one at tains Brahma Jnana. There is in di ca tion to that ef fect in Sruti,
“He who knows the high est Brah man be comes Brah man Him self”
(Mun. Up. III.2.9). “Be ing Brah man he goes to Brah man” (Bri. Up.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 355
```

IV.4.6). If the dif fer ence were real, then one could not be come Brah -
man Him self. Dif fer ence is only il lu sory or un real. Jiva is only a mere
shadow or re flec tion. He is mere ap pear ance. Just as the re flec tion of
the sun in the wa ter gets ab sorbed in the sun it self when the wa ter
dries up, so also the re flected Jiva gets ab sorbed in Brah man when
ig no rance is de stroyed by the dawn of Knowl edge of Brah man.

**C^`ì`nXoemÎd{hHw$ÊS>bdV²Ÿ&**

**Ubhayavyapadesattvahikundalavat** III.2.27 (345)
But on account of both (i.e., difference and non-difference)
being taught (by the Sruti), (the relation of the highest
Brahman to the individual soul has to be viewed) like that of
the snake to its coils.

**Ubhayavyapadesat:** on account of both being taught; **Tu:** but;
**Ahikundalavat:** like that between a serpent and its coils. ( **Ubhaya:**
both; **Vyapadesat:** on account of the declaration of the scrip ture; **Ahi:**
serpent; **Kundalavat:** like the coils.)

The dis cus sion on the char ac ter is tic of Brah man is re sumed.
Sutras 27 and 28 ex press the views of the Bhedabhedavadins.
Su tra 29 gives the real view.
Hav ing es tab lished the iden tity of the in di vid ual soul and Brah -
man the Sutrakara or the au thor men tions a dif fer ent view of the same
mat ter. He now pro ceeds to en quire into the doc trine of dif fer ence and
non-dif fer ence.
Some scrip tural texts re fer to the Su preme Soul and the in di vid -
ual soul as dis tinct en ti ties: “Two birds of beau ti ful plum age, etc.”
(Mun. Up. III.1.1). This text speaks of dif fer ence be tween the Jiva and
Brah man.
In some other texts the Su preme Soul is rep re sented as the ob -
ject of ap proach and as the ruler of the in di vid ual soul. “Then he sees
him med i tat ing on him as with out parts” (Mun. Up. III.1.8). “He goes to
the Di vine Per son who is greater than the great” (Mun. Up. III.2.8).
“Who rules all be ings within.”
In other texts again the two are spo ken of as non-dif fer ent.
“Thou art That” (Chh. Up. VI.8.7). “I am Brah man” (Bri. Up. I.4.10).
“This is thy Self who is within all” (Bri. Up. III.4.1). “He is thy Self, the
ruler within, the im mor tal” (Bri. Up. III.7.15).
As thus dif fer ence and non-dif fer ence are equally vouched for
by the Sruti texts, the ac cep ta tion of ab so lute non-dif fe r ence would
ren der fu tile all those texts which speak of dif fer ence. There fore we
have to take that their re la tion is one of dif fer ence and non-dif fer ence,
as be tween a ser pent and its coils. As a ser pent it is one non-dif fer ent,
but if we look at the coils, hood, erect pos ture, and so on, there is dif -
fer ence.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 356
```

Even so there is dif fer ence as well as non-dif fer ence be tween
the in di vid ual soul and Brah man. The dif fer ence be tween them prior
to eman ci pa tion is real. The Jiva be comes iden ti cal with Brah man
only when his ig no rance is de stroyed by the dawn of knowl edge of
Brah man.
Their sep a rate ness and one ness is like a ser pent in qui es cence
and mo tion.

**àH$meml`dÛm VoOñËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Prakasasrayavadva tejastvat** III.2.28 (346)

Or like (the relation of) light and its substratum, on account of

**Prakasasrayavat:** like light and its substratum; **Va:** or; **Tejastvat:** on
account of both being luminous.

The re la tion be tween Brah man and the in di vid ual soul also is
dis cussed.
Or else the re la tion of the two may be viewed as fol lows. An -
other il lus tra tion is given to es tab lish the the ory of dif fer ence and
non-dif fer ence. Just as the light of the sun and its sub stra tum, i.e., the
sun it self, are not ab so lutely dif fer ent, be cause they both con sist of
fire and yet are spo ken of as dif fe r ent, so also the in di vid ual soul and
the Su preme Soul (Brah man).
The light and the sun are both lu mi nous. Hence they are non-dif -
fer ent. They are dif fer ent ow ing to their vary ing ex tensity. Sim i larly is
the re la tion be tween the in di vid ual soul and the Su preme Soul one of
dif fer ence and non-dif fer ence. The for mer is lim ited and the lat ter is
all-per vad ing.

**nyd©dÛmŸ&**

**Purvavadva** III.2.29 (347)

Or (the relation between the two, i.e., Jiva and Brahman is) as
(given) before.

**Purvavat:** as before; **Va:** or.

Or it may be as stated in Su tra 25. This last is the real view, be -
cause if the in di vid ual soul is an other state of Brah man or a ray of
Brah man, such in her ent lim i ta tion will never dis ap pear. The Sruti af -
firms iden tity and states the fea ture of di ver sity which is due to Avidya.
The two pre vi ous Sutras ex press the view of
Bhedabhedavadins who main tain the doc trine of dif fer ence and
non-dif fer ence.
This Su tra re futes the view of Bhedabhedavadins and es tab -
lishes the fi nal truth which has been de clared in Su tra 25, viz., that the
dif fer ence is merely il lu sory, and iden tity or non-dif fer ence is the
reality.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 357
```

If the bond age of the soul is due to Avidya or ig no rance only, fi -
nal lib er a tion is pos si ble. But if the soul is re ally bound, whether the

soul be re garded as a cer tain con di tion or state of the Su preme Soul
or Brah man, as stated in Su tra 27, or as a part of the Su preme Soul,

as ex pressed in Su tra 28—its real bond age can not be de stroyed.

Thus the scrip tural doc trine of fi nal lib er a tion be comes pur pose less
and ab surd.
If the dif fer ence is real it can never come to an end. All the scrip -

tural in struc tions with re gard to the fi nal eman ci pa tion will be mean -
ing less. Bond age is only the idea of sep a rate ness. If sep a rate ness is

real there can be no fi nal re lease at all. But if the dif fer ence is due to
ne science or ig no rance, then knowl edge of Brah man or

Brahma-Jnana can an ni hi late it. Then the Su preme Re al ity or Brah -
man, the non-dif fer ence may be real ised.
It can not be said that the Sruti equally teaches dif fer ence and

non-dif fer ence. The Sruti aims at es tab lish ing non-dif fer ence only. It

merely re fers to dif fer ence as some thing known from other sources of
knowl edge, viz., per cep tion, etc.
Hence the views ex pressed in Sutras 27 and 28 are not cer tainly

cor rect. The view given in Su tra 25 alone is cor rect.
The con clu sion is that the soul is not dif fer ent from the Su preme
Soul or Brah man as ex plained in Su tra 25.

**à{VfoYmƒŸ&**

**Pratishedhaccha** III.2.30 (348)
And on account of the denial.

**Pratishedhat:** on account of denial; **Cha:** and, moreover.

Su tra 29 is con firmed.
The Sruti in fact ex pressly de nies sep a rate ness.
The con clu sion ar rived at above is con firmed by the fact of
scrip ture ex pressly de ny ing that there ex ists any in tel li gent be ing

apart from Brah man or the Su preme Soul. “There is no other Seer but

He— _Nanyato’sti Drashta_ ” (Bri. Up. III.7.23).
The same con clu sion fol lows from those pas sages which deny
the ex is tence of a world apart from Brah man, and thus leave Brah -

man alone re main ing, viz., “Now then the teach ing—not this, not this”
(Bri. Up. II.3.6). “That Brah man is with out cause and with out ef fect,

with out any thing in side or out side” (Bri. Up. II.5.19).
It is now an es tab lished fact that there is no other en tity but
Brah man. There fore there is only one Brah man with out any dif fer -

ence at all.

**Paramatah setunmanasambandha-
bhedavyapadesebhyah** III.2.31 (349)

(There is something) Superior to this (Brahman) on account of
terms denoting a bank, measure, connection and difference
(used with respect to It).

**Param:** greater; **Atah:** for this, than this (Brahman);
**Setunmanasambandhabhedavyapadesebhyah:** on account of
terms denoting a bridge, measure, connection and difference. ( **Setu:**
a bridge; **Unmana:** dimensions; **Sambandha:** relation; **Bheda:**
difference; **Vyapadesebhyah:** from the declarations.)

It may be said that there must be some thing higher than Brah -
man be cause Brah man is de scribed as a bridge, or as lim it ed or as at -
tained by man or as dif fer ent from man.
There arises now the doubt on ac count of the con flict ing na ture
of var i ous scrip tural state ments whether some thing ex ists be yond
Brah man or not.
The Purvapakshin holds that some en tity must be ad mit ted
apart from Brah man, be cause Brah man is spo ken of as be ing a bank,
as hav ing size, as be ing con nected, as be ing sep a rated. As a bank it
is spo ken of in the pas sage “The Self is a bank, a bound ary” (Chh. Up.
VIII.4.1). The term bank in ti mates that there ex ists some thing apart
from Brah man, just as there ex ists some thing dif fer ent from an or di -
nary bank. The same con clu sion is con firmed by the words “Hav ing
passed the bank” (Chh. Up. VIII.4.2). In or di nary life a man af ter hav -
ing crossed a bank, reaches some place which is not a bank, let us
say a for est. So we must un der stand that a man af ter hav ing crossed,
i.e., passed be yond Brah man, reaches some thing which is not Brah -
man.
As hav ing size Brah man is spo ken of in the fol low ing pas s ages
“This Brah man has four feet (quar ters), eight hoofs, six teen parts”
(Chh. Up. III.18.2). Now it is well known from or di nary ex pe ri ence that
wher ever an ob ject, e.g., a coin has a def i nite lim ited size, there ex ists
some thing dif fer ent from that ob ject. There fore we must as sume that
there also ex ists some thing dif fer ent from Brah man.
Brah man is de clared to be con nected in the fol low ing pas sages.
“Then he is united with the True” (Chh. Up. VI.8.1). “The em bod ied
self is em braced by the Su preme Self” (Bri. Up. IV.3.21). We ob serve
that non-mea sured things are con nected with the things mea sured,
e.g., men with a town. Scrip ture de clares that the in di vid ual souls are
in the state of deep sleep con nected with Brah man. There fore we
con clude that be yond Brah man there is some thing un mea sured.

The same con clu sion is con firmed by those texts which state dif -
fer ence. “Now that golden per son who is seen within the sun.” The
text re fers to a Lord re sid ing in the sun and then men tions a Lord re -
sid ing in the eye dis tinct from the for mer: “Now the per son who is
seen within the eye.”
The Sruti de clares “The At man is to be seen” etc. There is a
seer and there is the seen. There is dif fer ence.
All these in di cate that Brah man is not one with out a sec ond, and
that there ex ists some thing dif fer ent from Brah man.

**Samanyattu** III.2.32 (350)
But (Brahman is called a bank etc.) on account of similarity.

**Samanyat:** on account of similarity; **Tu:** but.

The ob jec tion raised in the pre ced ing Su tra is re futed here.
The word ‘tu’ (but) re moves the doubt. It sets aside the pre vi -
ously es tab lished con clu sion.
There can ex ist noth ing dif fer ent from Brah man. Brah man is
called the bank, etc., be cause He re sem bles it in a cer tain re spect. He
is the sup port of all while cross ing over this ocean of the world, just as
a bank is a great pro tec tion or help in cross ing a ca nal.
There can ex ist noth ing dif fer ent from Brah man as we are not
able to ob serve a proof for such ex is tence. All things pro ceed from

Brah man. The Sruti says that by know ing Brah man ev ery thing will be
known. How then can there be any other en tity? Bridge or bank
means like a bridge or bank.
Brah man is called a bank on ac count of sim i lar ity, not be cause
there ex ists some thing be yond Him. If the mere fact of Brah man be -
ing called a bank im plied the ex is tence of some thing be yond Him as
in the case of an or di nary bank, we should also be forced to con clude
that Brah man is made of earth and stones. This would go against the
scrip tural doc trine that Brah man is not some thing pro duced.
Brah man is called a bank be cause it re sem bles a bank in cer -
tain re spects. Just as a bank dams back the wa ter and makes the
bound ary of ad ja cent fields, so also Brah man sup ports the world and

its bound aries.
In the clause quoted above “Hav ing passed that bank” the verb
‘to pass’ can not be taken in the sense of ‘go ing be yond’ but must
rather mean ‘to reach fully’. “Hav ing passed the bank” means “hav ing
at tained Brah man fully” and not hav ing crossed it just as we say of a
stu dent “he has passed in the gram mar” mean ing thereby that he has
fully mas tered it.

**Buddhyarthah:** for the sake of easy comprehension; **Padavat:** just

like (four) feet.

The state ments as to the size of Brah man “Brah man has four
feet,” “It has six teen dig its,” etc., are meant for the sake of Upasana or
de vout med i ta tion, be cause it is dif fi cult to un der stand the In fi nite,

The de scrip tion of Brah man as hav ing a lim ited form

Just as mind con ceived as the per sonal man i fes ta tion of Brah -

This is sim i lar to the case of light and the like. The light of the sun
also is dif fer en ti ated by its con nec tion with lim it ing ad juncts. The light

is said to be di vided on ac count of these ad juncts. It is said to en ter
into con nec tion or un ion when the ad juncts are re moved.
We see two moons on ac count of an eye-dis ease. We see only
one when the dis ease is re moved.
Light is re ally one but we speak of light in side a room and light

out side it. The dis tinc tion is due to lim it ing ad juncts. The light in side
the room may be said to be united with the light in gen eral when the

room is de stroyed.

Be cause scrip tural pas sages such as “He is gone to his self” (Chh.

Up. VI.8.1) de clare that the con nec tion of the soul with the Su preme
Soul is one of es sen tial na ture. The es sen tial na ture of a thing is im -
per ish able. Hence the con nec tion can not be like that of the in hab it -

ants with the town.
The con nec tion can only be ex plained with ref er ence to an ob -
ser va tion ow ing to ig no rance of the true na ture of the soul.
Sim i larly the dif fer ence re ferred to by scrip ture can not be real
but due to ig no rance, be cause many texts de clare that there ex ists

only one Brah man.
Scrip ture teaches that the one ether is made man i fold as it were
by its con nec tion with dif fer ent places. “The ether which is out side
man is the ether which is in side man, and the ether within the heart”

(Chh. Up. III.12.7).

**Tatha:** similarly; **Anyapratishedhat:** on account of the express

**Pratishedhat:** owing to the denial, or prohibition or negation.)

Fur ther the Sruti de nies ex pressly that there is any other en tity

By this the Omnipresence (of Brahman is established) in

**Anena:** by this; **Sarvagatatvam:** all-pervadingness; **Ayama:**
(regarding Brahman’s) extent; **Sabdadibhyah:** from scriptural
statements.

By the re ject ing of the tak ing of the de scrip tion as bridge or bank
etc., in their ac tual sense, it is clear that Brah man has
all-pervadingness. Such Om ni pres ence is clear also from such words
as Ayama. If you take the de scrip tion as bridge etc., in their ac tual
sense but not in the fig u ra tive sense, Brah man will be come lim ited,
and con se quently not eter nal. But the Sruti and Smriti de scribe Brah -
man as un lim ited and all-per va sive. The word Ayama means per va -
sive. The all-pervadingness of Brah man fol lows from the very fact
that it is one with out a sec ond.
That Brah man is Om ni pres ent fol lows from the texts pro claim -
ing its ex tent. “As large as this ether is, so large is that ether within the
heart” (Chh. Up. VIII.1.3). “Like the ether, he is Om ni pres ent and eter -
nal.” “He is greater than the sky, greater than the ether” (Sat. Br.

Phaladhikaranam: Topic 8 (Sutras 38-41)
The Lord is the giver of the fruits of actions
```
**\$b_V CnnÎmo...Ÿ&**

**Phalamata upapatteh** III.2.38 (356)

From Him (the Lord) are the fruits of actions, for that is
reasonable.

**Phalam:** the fruit; **Atah:** from Him only; **Upapatteh:** for that is
reasonable.

An other char ac ter is tic of Brah man is es tab lished.
The Mimamsakas hold that the Karma (work) and not the Lord
gives the fruits of one’s ac tions.
The Su tra re futes it and de clares that the fruits of one’s work
viz., pain, plea sure and a mix ture of the two, come only from the Lord.
The Lord of all who knows all the dif fer ences of place and time
alone is ca pa ble of be stow ing fruits in ac cor dance with the merit of
the agents. Karma is in sen tient and short-lived. It ceases to ex ist as
soon as it is done. It can not there fore be stow the fruits of ac tions at a
fu ture date ac cord ing to one’s merit.
How can fruit which is pos i tive re sult from such non-ex is tence?
You can not say that Karma died af ter gen er at ing the fruit which
at ta ches it self to the doer in due time, be cause it is called fruit only
when it is en joyed.
You can not say also that Karma gen er ates Apurva which gives
fruit. Apurva is Achetana (non-sen tient). It can not act un less moved
by some in tel li gent be ing. It can not, there fore, be stow re wards and
pun ish ments. Fur ther there is no proof what ever for the ex is tence of
such an Apurva.

The Sruti also de clares that the fruits of ac tions come from the

**Dharmam Jaiminirata eva** III.2.40 (358)

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 364
```

Jaimini thinks for the same reasons (viz., scriptural autho rity

and reasoning, on the same ground as stated in Sutras 38 and
39 ) that religious merit (is what brings about the fruits of
actions).

**Dharmam:** practice of religious duties, religious merits; **Jaiminih:** the
sage Jaimini; **Ata eva:** for the same reasons.

An ob jec tion is raised to Sutras 38 and 39.
The view of the Sutras 38 and 39 is be ing criti cised.
Jaimini says that Dharma gives fruits of ac tions as Sruti and rea -
son sup port such a view.
Scrip ture, Jaimini ar gues, pro claims in junc tions such as the fol -
low ing one “He who is de sir ous of the heav enly world is to sac ri fice”. It
is ad mit ted that ev ery scrip tural in junc tion has an ob ject. There fore it
is rea son able to think that the scrip ture it self brings about the fruit or
the re sult, i.e., the at tain ment of the heav enly world. If this were not
so, no body would per form sac ri fices and thereby scrip tural in junc -
tions would be ren dered pur pose less.
But it may be ob jected that an ac tion can not pro duce a re sult at
a fu ture time as it is de stroyed.
Jaimini says: A deed can not pro duce re sult at some fu ture time,
un less be fore pass ing away, it gives birth to some un seen re sult. We,
there fore, as sume that there ex ists some ex tra or di nary prin ci ple
called Apurva which is pro duced by the Karma be fore it is de stroyed.
The re sult is pro duced at some fu ture time on ac count of this Apurva.
This hy poth e sis re moves all dif fi cul ties. But on the con trary it is
im pos si ble that the Lord should ef fect the fruits of Kar mas. Be cause
one uni form cause (Isvara) can not cause va ri ety of ef fects. He will
have par tial ity and cru elty; and Karma will be come pur pose less, i.e., if
the deed it self can not bring about its own fruit, it would be use less to
per form it at all.
For all these rea sons the re sult springs from the ac tion only,
whether mer i to ri ous or non-mer i to ri ous. (This is the view of Jaimini).

**nydª Vw ~mXam`Umo hoVwì`nXoemV²Ÿ&**

**Purvam Baadarayano hetuvyapadesat** III.2.41 (359)

But Baadarayana thinks the former (i.e., the Lord to be the

to be the cause (of the actions themselves).

**Purvam:** the former, i. e., the Lord as the giver of the fruits of actions;
**Tu:** but; **Baadarayanah:** Baadarayana, the framer of the Sutras
(holds); **Hetuvyapadesat:** on account of His being declared the
cause (of the actions themselves).

The view of Jaimini ex pressed in Su tra 40 is re futed by cit ing a
con trary one.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 2 365
```

The word ‘Tu’ (but) re futes the view of Su tra 40. It sets aside the
view of the fruit be ing pro duced ei ther by the mere ac tion or the mere
Apurva.
The sage Baadarayana holds the for mer, i.e., the Lord is the
Dis penser of the fruit of ac tions. The Sruti clearly states that all re -
wards whether heaven or un ion with the Lord come from Him, “He
takes one to a purer world by vir tue of one’s pi ety— _Punyena punyam
lokam nayati_ ”. Also Katha Upanishad (I.2.23) de clares “He gives Him -
self away to whom so ever He chooses— _Yamevaisha vrinute tena
labhyah_ ”.
Baadarayana says that the Lord be stows the fruits of deeds be -
cause Sruti says that the Lord in duces the do ing of ac tions and gives
the fruits thereof. As the Lord acts ac cord ing to the va ri ety of Kar mas,
he can pro duce and give a va ri ety of re sults and has no par tial ity and
cru elty, and Karma will not be come pur pose less.
The Lord is the causal agent with ref er ence to all ac tions
whether good or evil. Kaushitaki Upanishad (III.8) de clares “He
makes him whom He wishes to lead up from these worlds do a good
deed and the same makes him whom He wishes to lead down from
these worlds do a bad deed.”
The same is said in Bhagavad Gita (VII.21-22), “Which ever di -
vine form a dev o tee wishes to wor ship with faith, to that form I ren der
his faith steady. Hold ing that faith he strives to pro pi ti ate the de ity and
ob tains from it the ben e fits he de sires, as or dained by Me.”
More over all Vedanta texts de clare that the Lord is the only
cause of all cre ations. The Lord cre ates all be ings in forms and con di -
tions cor re spond ing to and re trib u tive of their for mer Kar mas. Hence
the Lord is the cause of all fruits of ac tions. As the Lord has re gard for
the merit and de merit of the souls, the ob jec tions raised above that a
uni form cause is in ca pa ble of pro duc ing var i ous ef fects, etc., are with -
out any foun da tion.
To sum up, the na ture of the Su preme Brah man has been de -
scribed. Brah man has been shown to be form less, self-lu mi nous and
with out dif fer ence. It has been es tab lished through “Neti-Neti” “not
this, not this” doc trine that Brah man is one with out a sec ond. It has
been con clu sively proved that the Lord is the Dis penser of the fruits of
Kar mas of the peo ple.

INTRODUCTION
```
In the pre vi ous Sec tion (Pada 2) it has been shown that the Jiva
(Tvam Pada of the Tat-Tvam-Asi Mahavakya) is iden ti cal with Brah -
man (Tat Pada of Tat-Tvam-Asi Mahavakya). Brah man has been
shown to be Ekarasa (of ho mo ge neous or un chang ing na ture). We
have ex plained the na ture of the ob ject of cog ni tion, i.e., Brah man.
The au thor of the Brahma Sutras now sets him self to as cer tain
the end and aim of the Vidyas (med i ta tions of Upasanas) as pre -
scribed in the Srutis.
The Srutis pre scribe var i ous kinds of Vidyas or med i ta tions to
en able the as pi rant to at tain the knowl edge of iden tity. It is ex tremely
dif fi cult or rather im pos si ble for the or di nary man to have a com pre -
hen sive un der stand ing of the In fi nite, which is tran scen dent, ex -
tremely sub tle and be yond the reach of the senses and gross
un dis ci plined in tel lect. There fore the Srutis or the sa cred scrip tures
pre scribe easy meth ods of Saguna med i ta tion for ap proach ing the In -
fi nite or the Ab so lute. They pres ent var i ous sym bols of Brah man
(Pratikas) such as Vaisvanara or Virat, Sun, Akasa, Food, Prana and
mind for the neo phyte or the be gin ner to con tem plate on. These sym -
bols are props for the mind to lean upon in the be gin ning. The gross
mind is ren dered sub tle, sharp and one-pointed by such Saguna
forms of med i ta tion.
These dif fer ent meth ods of ap proach ing the Im per sonal Ab so -
lute are known as Vidyas or Upasanas.
This Sec tion dis cusses these var i ous Vidyas by means of which
the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul at tains Brah man or the Su preme Soul.
Sim i lar Vidyas are de scribed dif fer ently in dif fer ent recensions of the
Vedas. Now the ques tion arises nat u rally whether these sim i lar
Vidyas are one and the same or dif fer ent, whether sim i lar Vidyas
have to be com bined into a sin gle Upasana or med i ta tion or to be
taken sep a rately. It is de cided here which Vidyas are the same and
have to be com bined into one and which Vidyas are dif fer ent de spite
cer tain sim i lar fea tures.
The aim and ob ject of all Vidyas is the at tain ment of Brah man or
the Im per ish able. Brah man alone is the only liv ing Re al ity. Brah man
alone is Truth. Brah man is Sat or Ex is tence Ab so lute. Hence it may
be ad van ta geous and help ful to com bine the par tic u lars of the same
Vidya men tioned in dif fer ent recensions or Sakhas as they have been

```
367
```

found highly ef fi ca cious and im mensely ben e fi cial by the fol low ers of
those Sakhas.
He who med i tates on Brah man as mind as is taught in the
Taittiriya Upanishad, Bhrigu Valli, must col late all the at trib utes of the
mind not only from his own par tic u lar Ve dic Sakha, but from other
Sakhas also where med i ta tion on Brah man in the form of mind is
taught. In med i tat ing on Brah man as mind, he must not bring to gether
at trib utes not be long ing to mind such as those of food, though Brah -
man is taught to be med i tat ed upon as food also. In fact only those at -
trib utes are to be sup plied from other Sakhas which are taught about
the par ti c u lar ob ject of med i ta tion, and not any at trib ute in gen eral.
In this Sec tion Sri Vyasa the framer of the Brahma Sutras con -
cludes that most of the Vidyas pre scribed in the Srutis have for their
ob ject the knowl edge of Brah man or Brahma-Jnana. They dif fer only

in form but not in sub stance. Their fi nal goal is the at tain ment of ev er -
last ing peace, eter nal bliss and im mor tal ity. One med i ta tion or
Upasana or Vidya is as good as an other for at tain ing the fi nal eman ci -
pa tion.
Sruti teaches us to med i tate on Brah man ei ther di rectly or
through the me dium of some Pratikas or sym bols, such as the sun,
Akasa, food, mind, Prana, the Purusha re sid ing in the eye, the empty
space (Daharakasa) within the heart, Om or Pranava and the like.
You will have to search Brah man and adore Him in and through
the sym bols, but these sym bols must not usurp His place. You must
con cen trate and fix the mind on these sym bols and think of His at trib -
utes such as Om nip o tence, Om ni science, Om ni pres ence,
Sat-Chit-Ananda, pu rity, per fec tion, free dom, etc.
The Vidyas ap pear to be dif fer ent only from the view-point of dif -
fer ence in the sym bols but the goal ev ery where is the same. Re mem -
ber this point al ways. Bear this in mind con stantly.
Some at trib utes of Brah man are found com mon in some of the
Vidyas. You should not con sider your self as a dis tinct en tity from
Brah man. This is a fun da men tal or vi tal point.
In all the Vidyas three things are com mon. The fi nal goal is the

at tain ment of eter nal bliss and im mor tal ity, through the reali sa tion of
Brah man with or with out the aid of the sym bols or Pratikas. The at trib -
utes which are found in com mon in all the Vidyas such as bliss ful -
ness, pu rity, per fec tion, knowl edge, im mor tal ity, Ab so lute Free dom or
Kaivalya, Ab so lute In de pend ence, eter nal sat is fac tion and the like
must be in vari ably as so ci ated with the con cep tion of Brah man. The
meditator must think him self iden ti cal with Brah man and must wor -
ship Brah man as his Im mor tal At man.

BRAHMA SUTRAS 368
```

**SYNOPSIS**
_Adhikaranas I and II:_ (Sutras 1-4; 5) are con cerned with the
ques tion whether those Vidyas which are met with in iden ti cal or sim i -
lar form in more than one sa cred text, are to be con sid ered as con sti -
tut ing sev eral Vidyas or one Vidya only. The Vidyas with iden ti cal or
sim i lar form met with in the scrip tures or in dif fer ent recensions of the
scrip tures, are one Vidya. Par tic u lars of iden ti cal Vidyas men tioned in
dif fer ent places or Sakhas are to be com bined with one med i ta tion.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 6-8) dis cusses the case of Vidyas which
are sep a rate on ac count of dif fer ent sub ject-mat ter, al though in other
re spects there are sim i lar i ties. The ex am ples se lected are the
Udgitha Vidyas of the Chhandogya Upanishad (I.1.3) and the
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (I.3.1). Al though they in di cate cer tain
sim i lar i ties such as bear ing the same name and the Udgitha be ing in
both iden ti fied with Prana—yet they are to be held apart, be cause the
sub ject of the Chhandogya Vidya is not the whole Udgitha but only the
sa cred syl la ble OM while Brihadaranyaka Upanishad rep re sents the
whole Udgitha as the ob ject of med i ta tion.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Su tra 9). In the pas sage, “Let one med i tate on
the syl la ble ‘OM’ (of) the Udgitha” (Chh. Up. I.1.1), the Omkara and
the Udgitha stand in the re la tion of one spec i fy ing the other. The
mean ing is “Let one med i tate on that Omkara which” etc.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Su tra 10) in ti mates that there should be no mis -
take in the iden tity of the Prana Vidya as taught in Chhandogya,
Brihadaranyaka and Kaushitaki. It de ter mines the unity of the
Prana-Vidyas and the con se quent com pre hen sion of the dif fer ent

_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 11-13) in ti mates that the es sen tial and
un al ter able at trib utes of Brah man such as Bliss and knowl edge are to

_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 14-15) teaches that the ob ject of Katha
Upanishad (III.10, 11) is one only, viz., to in di cate that the Su preme
Self is higher than ev ery thing, so that the pas sage forms one Vidya
only.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Sutras 16-17) in ti mates that the Self re fer red

_Adhikarana IX:_ (Su tra 18) dis cusses a mi nor point con nected

_Adhikarana X:_ (Su tra 19) de clares that the Vidyas in the same
Sakha which are iden ti cal or sim i lar have to be com bined, for they are
one.
_Adhikarana XI:_ (Sutras 20-22). In Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
(V.5), Brah man is rep re sented first as abid ing in the sphere of the sun
and then as abid ing within the right eye. The names “Ahar” and
“Aham” of the Su preme Brah man abid ing in the sun and in the right
eye re spec tively can not be com bined, as these are two sep a rate
Vidyas.
_Adhikarana XII:_ (Su tra 23). At trib utes of Brah man men tion ed in
Ranayaniya-Khila are not to be taken into con sid er ation in other
Brahma-Vidyas, e.g., the Sandilya Vidya, as the for mer is an in de -
pend ent Vidya ow ing to the dif fer ence of Brah man’s abode.
_Adhikarana XIII:_ (Su tra 24) points out that the Purusha-Vidya of
Chhandogya is quite dif fer ent from the Purusha-Vidya of Tait tiriya

Brahmana about the Mahavrata cer e mony at the be gin ning of the

show un mis tak able signs of be ing con nected with sac ri fi cial acts.
_Adhikarana XV:_ (Su tra 26) treats of the pas sage stat ing that the

_Adhikarana XVI:_ (Sutras 27-28) de cides that the shak ing of the

_Adhikarana XVII:_ (Sutras 29-30) in ti mates that the knower of the
Saguna Brah man alone goes by the path of the gods af ter death and
not the knower of the Nirguna Brah man. The soul of him who knows
the Nirguna Brah man be comes one with it with out mov ing to any
other place.
_Adhikarana XVIII:_ (Su tra 31) de cides that the road of the gods is

The Sruti en joins re cip ro cal med i ta tion and not merely one way.
_Adhikarana XXIV:_ (Su tra 38) de ter mines that the Vidyas of the
True (Satya Brah man) con tained in Bri. Up. (V.4.1 and V.5.2) is one

there fore not in sep a ra bly con nected with them.
_Adhikarana XXVIII:_ (Su tra 43) teaches that in a Bri. Up. pas sage

_Adhikarana XXIX:_ (Sutras 44-52) de cides that the fire-al tars
made of mind etc., which are men tioned in the Agnirahasya of the
Brihadaranyaka are not part of the sac ri fi cial act, but con sti tute a sep -
a rate Vidya.
_Adhikarana XXX:_ (Sutras 53-54) de ter mines that the self is a

Upasana, are valid for all Sakhas.
_Adhikarana XXXII:_ (Su tra 57) de cides that the Vaisvanara

Sarvavedantapratyayadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-4)
The Vidyas having identical or the same form
found in scriptures constitute one Vidya
```
**gd©doXmÝVàË``§ MmoXZmÚ{deofmV²Ÿ&**

**Sarvavedantapratyayam chodanadyaviseshat** III.3.1 ( 360 )

(The Vidyas or the Upasanas) described in the various Vedanta

texts (are not different, are identical) on account of the

non-difference of injunction, etc., (i.e., connection, form and

name).

**Sarvavedantapratyayam:** exposition of Brahman in all the Vedanta
texts; **Chodanadyaviseshat:** as there is no difference in the

injunctions, etc., (i.e., con nection, form and name). ( **Sarva:** all; **Veda:**

the Vedas; **Anta:** the settled conclusion; **Pratyayam:** the knowledge,
realisation; **Chodanadi:** or the injunction and others; **Aviseshat:** as

there is no difference.)

Can Srutis de clare dif fer ent Upasanas in re spect of one en tity?
If we say that one Sruti is cor rect and oth ers are in cor rect, dis be lief in
Srutis as a whole will fol low. The Srutis which de clare the na ture of
Brah man are not com mands. They only state solid facts.
The au thor of the Sutras now pro ceeds to dis cuss whether the
Upasana (de vo tional) Srutis are di ver gent and sep a rate or not. Scrip -
tures teach that like Karma, Upasanas have var i ous re sults. Some of
them have vis i ble re sults, oth ers un seen re sults. Some Upasanas
cre ate true knowl edge and lead to Krama mukti or grad ual lib er a tion
or re lease by suc ces sive steps. With a view to those med i ta tions,
there fore, we may raise the ques tion whether the in di vid ual
Vedanta-texts teach dif fer ent Upasanas of Brah man or not.
There are many ex po si tions of Brah man in Sruti. In some Sruti
He is de scribed as Vaisvanara, in an other He is de scribed as Prana
and so forth. Now a doubt may arise as to whether these ex po si tions
are dif fer ent or they all aim at one and the same thing.
This Su tra re moves the doubt. The ex po si tions in all the Srutis
are the same. They all point to one and the same pur pose of wor ship
of Brah man, though in dif fer ent forms fit ted to the ca pac ity of the
meditator, be cause there is no dif fer ence in the in junc tions about
med i ta tion. All the in junc tions in ti mate that Brah man is to be med i -
tated upon. Hence the ob ject of those ex po si tions and of med i ta tion is
one and the same.
The Upasanas of Prana are de scribed in one way in the
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and in a dif fer ent way in the Chhandogya
Upanishad. Now a doubt arises whether such Upasanas de scribed
dif fer ently in dif fer ent Sakhas of the Vedas are dif fer ent or the same.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 373
```

The Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains that they are dif -
fer ent ow ing to the dif fer ence in form. This Su tra re futes it and de -
clares that such med i ta tions are one and the same ow ing to the
non-dif fer ence as re gards in junc tions, con nec tion, name and form of
these in dif fer ent Sakhas.
Thus, as the Agnihotra though de scribed in dif fer ent Sakhas is
yet one, the same kind of hu man ac tiv ity be ing en joined in all by
means of the words “He is to of fer”, so the in junc tion met with in the
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (VI.1.1.). “He who knows the old est and
the best”, etc., is the same as that which oc curs in the text of
Chhandogya “He who knows the first and the best” (Chh. Up. V.1.1).
The Prana-Vidya in all the Sakhas is one and the same. There is
non-dif fer ence as re gards the fruit of the Upasana in both texts. “He
who knows it to be such be comes the first and best among his peo -
ple” (Bri. Up. VI.1.1). Prana is the ob ject of med i ta tion in both texts.
The name of the med i ta tion in both texts is Prana-Vidya. Prana is de -
scribed in both texts as the old est and the great est. There fore the two
Vidyas are not dif fer ent, as there is no dif fer ence in all re spects. The
two Vidyas are one and the same. The same is true of Dahara-Vidya,
Panchagni-Vidya or the knowl edge of the five fires, Vaisvanara-Vidya
or the knowl edge of the Vaisvanara, Sandilya-Vidya, etc., de scribed
in var i ous Sakhas.

**^oXmÞo{V MoÞ¡H$ñ`m_{nŸ&**

**Bhedanneti chennaikasyamapi** III.3.2 ( 361 )

If it be said that the Vidyas are separate on account of
difference (in minor points), we deny that, since even in the
same Vidyas (there may be such minor differences).

**Bhedat:** on account of difference; **Na:** not; **Iti:** as, so, this; **Chet:** if;
**Na:** no, not; **Ekasyam:** in the one and the same (Vidya); **Api:** also,
even.

An ob jec tion to the pre ced ing Su tra is raised and re futed.
The Su tra con sists of two parts namely an ob jec tion and its re -
ply. The ob jec tion is “ _Bhedanneti chet_ ”. The re ply is “ _Naikasyamapi_ ”.
If you say that dif fer ence ex ists, we say that it is not so, be cause
such dif fer ences can ex ist even in the same Upasana or Vidya.
Doubt less the Vajasaneyins re fer to a sixth Agni when re fer ring
to Panchagni Vidya or the doc trine of five fires “The fire be comes his
fire” (Bri. Up. VI.2.24), but the Chhandogyas do not. “But he who
knows these five fires” (Chh. Up. V.10.10). But this will not make them
sep a rate. The Chhandogyas also can add it if they like. Thus the
Vidya as stated in the two Srutis Brihadaranyaka and Chhandogya, is
iden ti cal.
The pres ence or ab sence of a sixth fire can not make a dif fer -
ence as re gards form, be cause the Shodasi ves sel may or may not be

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 374
```

taken in the same Atiratra sac ri fice. The name “five fires” is no ob jec -
tion against this in crease of num ber, be cause the num ber five is not a
fun da men tal part of the in junc tion. Dif fer ences like this are found in
dif fer ent chap ters even in the same Sakha and in the same Vidya,
and yet the Vidya de scribed in these dif fer ent chap ters is re cog nised
by all as one.
The Chhandogya Upanishad also ac tu ally men tions a sixth fire,
viz., in the pas sage V.9.2 “When he has de parted his friends carry
him, as ap pointed, to the fire.”
There fore it is quite clear that the Vidyas of the same class are
one and not dif fer ent not with stand ing these dif fer ences in dif fer ent
Sakhas.
The Purvapakshin says: Then again in the con ver sa tion be -
tween the Pranas, the Chhandogyas men tion in ad di tion to the most
im por tant Prana four other Pranas viz., speech, the eye, the ear and
the mind, while the Vajasaneyins men tion a fifth one also. “Seed in -
deed is gen er a tion. He who knows that be comes rich in off spring and
cat tle” (Bri. Up. VI.1.6).
We re ply: noth ing stands in the way of some ad di tional qual i fi ca -
tion be ing in cluded in the Vidya con cern ing the col lo quy of the
Pranas. The ad di tion or omis sion of some par tic u lar qual i fi ca tion is
not able to cre ate dif fer ence in the ob ject of knowl edge and thereby in
the knowl edge it self, be cause the ob jects of knowl edge may dif fer
partly, yet their greater part and at the same time the know ing per son
are un der stood to be the same.
There fore the Vidya also re mains the same.

**Svadhyayasya tathatvena hi samachare’dhikaraccha
savavaccha tanniyamah** III.3.3 ( 362 )

(The rite of carrying fire on the head is connected) with the
study of the Veda (of the Atharvanikas), because in the
Samachara (it is mentioned) as being such. And (this also
follows) from its being a qualification (for the students of the
Atharva Veda) as in the case with the (seven) oblations (viz.,
Saurya etc.).

**Svadhyayasya:** of the study of the Vedas; **Tathatvena:** on account of
being such; **Hi:** because; **Samachare:** in the book named
Samachara containing the rules for the performance of Vedic rites;
**Adhikarat:** on account of the qualification; **Cha:** and; **Savavat:** as in
the case of the seven oblations (viz., Saurya, etc.); **Cha:** and, also;
**Tanniyamah:** that rule.

An ob jec tion based on a state ment of the Mundaka Upanishad
is ex plained and re futed.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 375
```

A fur ther ob jec tion is raised. In the Mundaka Upanishad which
deals with the knowl edge of Brah man, the car ry ing of fire on the head
by the stu dent (Sirovrata) is men tioned. The Purvapakshin or the op -
po nent main tains that the Vidyas of the Atharvanikas are dif fer ent
from all other Vidyas on ac count of this par tic u lar cer e mony which is
prac tised by the fol low ers of the Atharva Veda.
This Su tra re futes this and says that the rite of car ry ing fire on
the head is an at trib ute not of the Vidya, but merely of the study of the
Veda on the part of the Atharvanikas. So it is de scribed in the book
Samachara which treats of Ve dic ob ser vances.
At the close of the Upanishad more over we have the fol low ing
sen tence, “A man who has not per formed the rite (car ry ing fire on the
head) does not read this” (Mun. Up. III.2. 1 1). This clearly in ti mates
that it is con nected with the study of the Upanishad and not with the
Vidya.
The Su tra adds an other il lus tra tive in stance in the words “as in
the case of the li ba tions there is lim i ta tion of that”. The rite of car ry ing
the fire is as so ci ated only with the study of that par tic u lar Veda and
not oth ers, like the seven ob la tions from the Saurya li ba tion up to the
Sataudana li ba tion, which are not con nected with the fires taught in
the other Vedas, but only with those of Atharva Veda. The com mand
is to those study ing the Mundaka Upanishad just as the com mand to
per form the seven Savas is to them. The car ry ing of a fire-pot on their
head will not make the Vidya dif fer ent.
There fore there is unity of Vidya in all cases. The doc trine of the
unity of the Vidyas thus re mains un shaken.

**Xe©`{V MŸ&**

**Darsayati cha** III.3.4 ( 363 )
(The scripture) also instructs (thus).

**Darsayati:** (Sruti) shows, instructs; **Cha:** also.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 1 is given.
The Veda also de clares the iden tity of the Vidyas, be cause all
Vedanta texts rep re sent the ob ject of knowl edge, as one, e.g., Katha
Upanishad (I.2.15), “That word which all the Vedas de clare”; Aitareya
Aranyaka (III.2.3.12) “Him only the Bahvrichas con sider in the great
hymn, the Adhvaryus in the sac ri fi cial fire, the Chhandogyas in the
Mahavrata cer e mony.”
To prove the unity of the Vidyas some other in stances may be
quoted. Kathopanishad (I.6.2) men tions as one of the Lord’s qual i ties
that He causes fear. Now this very same qual ity is re ferred to in the
Tait. Up. II.7: “For if he makes but the small est dis tinc tion in the Self,
there is fear for him. But that fear is only for him who knows a dif fer -
ence and does not know one ness.”

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 376
```

The Im per sonal Ab so lute is the one pur port of all the Vedanta
texts. Hence all Vidyas which per tain to It must also be one. The med i -
ta tion on the Saguna Brah man as Vaisvanara, who is rep re sented as
ex tend ing from heaven to the earth in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
is re ferred to in the Chhandogya Upanishad, “But he who adores that
Vaisvanara Self as ex tend ing from heaven to the earth” (Chh. Up.
V.18.1). This clearly in di cates that all Vaisvanara Vidyas are one.
Nirguna Brah man is one and not many. Saguna Brah man also
is one and not many. Hence par tic u lar Vidyas which per tain to ei ther
Saguna Brah man or Nirguna Brah man are also one and not many.
This also fol lows from the same hymns and the like en joined in the
one place be ing em ployed in other places for the pur pose of de vout
med i ta tion or Upasana.
The same rule ap plies to other Vidyas also be sides the
Vaisvanara Vidya. There fore, Vidyas are not many, though they are
dif fer ently de scribed in dif fer ent Sakhas. All Vedantic texts in ti mate
iden ti cal de vout med i ta tions. Thus the unity of Vidyas is es tab lished.

And in the Upasanas of the same class (mentioned in differ ent
Sakhas) a combination (of all the particulars mentioned in all
Sakhas is to be made) as there is no difference in the object of

**Upasamharah:** combination; **Arthabhedat:** as there is no difference
in the object of meditation; **Vidhiseshavat:** like the subsidiary rites of
a main sacrifice; **Samane:** in the Upasanas of the same class, in the
case of equality, the forms of meditation being the same in effect;
**Cha:** also, and. ( **Artha:** purpose; **Abheda:** non-difference; **Vidhi:**

A de duc tion is made from the four pre ced ing Sutras. This Su tra

The Vidyas de scribed in dif fer ent Sakhas will have to be com -

the same, just as in the case of Vidhiseshas.
The par tic u lars that are men tioned in other Sakhas than one’s
own are also ef fi ca cious. There fore one will have to com bine all
these, just as one does in the case of sub sid iary rites like Agnihotra
con nected with a main sac ri fice, men tioned in sev eral Sakhas.

Those Vidyas with different subject-matter are separate,

**AÝ`WmËd§ eãXm{X{V MoÞm{deofmV²Ÿ&**

**Anyathatvam sabdaditi chennaviseshat** III.3.6 ( 365 )

If it be said (that the Udgitha Vidya of the Brihadaranyaka

Upanishad and that of the Chhandogya Upanishad) are

different on account of (difference in) texts; we deny this on the

ground of their non-difference (as regards essentials).

**Anyathatvam:** there is difference; **Sabdat:** on account of (difference

in) texts; **Iti:** so; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not; **Aviseshat:** on account of

non-difference (as regards essentials).

This Su tra rep re sents the view of the Purvapakshin or the op po -
nent. The op po nent tries to es tab lish that the two Vidyas are one.
The Su tra con sists of two parts namely, a sup posed ob jec tion to
the ob jec tor’s view and its ref u ta tion by the ob jec tor to strengthen his
case. The sup posed ob jec tion is “ _Anyathatvam sabdaditi chet_ ” and
the re ply is “ _Naviseshat_ ”.
It is said in the Vajasaneyaka (I.3.1), “The Devas said, ‘Well, let
us de feat the Asuras at the sac ri fices by means of the Udgitha!’ They
said to speech: ‘sing for us.’ The speech said ‘yes’.”
The speech and the other Pranas were pierced by the Asuras
with evil. They were not able to do what was ex pected from them.
There upon the Devas ap pointed the Chief Prana, and said to the
breath in the mouth ‘sing for us’. The breath said ‘yes’ and sang.
There is a sim i lar story in Chhandogya Upanishad I.2. The
Devas took the Udgitha. They thought they would over come the
Asuras with it. The other Pranas were pierced with evil and thus van -
quished by the Asuras. There upon the Devas went to the Chief
Prana. “Then co mes the Chief Prana. On that they med i tated as
Udgitha.”
Both these pas sages glo rify the chief Prana. Hence it fol l ows
that they both are in junc tions of a med i ta tion on the Prana. A doubt
arises now whether the two Vidyas are sep a rate Vidyas or one Vidya
only.
The Purvapakshin holds that the two Vidyas have to be con sid -
ered as one. It may be ob jected that they can not be one on ac count of
the dif fer ence in texts. The Vajasaneyins rep re sent the chief vi tal air
as the pro ducer of the Udgitha, “Do thou sing out for us”; while the
Chhandogyas speak of it as it self be ing the Udgitha, “On that they
med i tated as Udgitha”. How can this di ver gence be rec on ciled with
the as sump tion of the unity of the Vidyas?

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 378
```

But this is not ac cept able be cause there is unity as re gards a
great many points. Both texts re late that the Devas and the Asuras
were fight ing; both at first glo rify speech and the other Pranas in their
re la tion to the Udgitha and there upon find ing fault with them pass on
to the chief Prana; both tell how through the strength of the lat ter, the
Asuras were van quished.
The dif fer ence pointed out, is not im por tant enough to bring
about a sep a ra tion of the two Vidyas.
The text of the Vajasaneyaka also co or di nates the chief Prana
and the Udgitha in the clause, “He is Udgitha” (Bri. Up. I.3.23). We
there fore have to as sume that in the Chhandogya also the chief
Prana has sec ond arily to be looked upon as the pro ducer of the
Udgitha.
The two texts thus con sti tute one Vidya only. There is unity of
Vidyas on the grounds given in Su tra III.3.1.

**Z dm àH$aU^oXmËnamodar`ñËdm{XdV²Ÿ&**

**Na va prakaranabhedatparovariyastvadivat** III.3.7 ( 366 )
Or rather there is no (unity of the Vidyas) owing to the
difference of subject matter even as (the meditation on the
Udgitha) as the highest and greatest (i.e., Brahman) (is
different from the meditation on the Udgitha as abiding in the
eye etc.).

**Na:** not; **Va:** certainly; **Prakaranabhedat:** on account of difference in
subject matter; **Parovariyastvadivat:** even as (the meditation on the
Udgitha) as the highest and great (Brahman) (is different).

The ob jec tion raised in the pre ced ing Su tra is re futed.
The Su tra re futes the for mer view and es tab lishes that the two
Vidyas, in spite of sim i lar ity in many points, are dif fer ent ow ing to dif -
fer ence in sub ject mat ter.
In the Chhandogya, Omkara is said to be a limit of Udgitha and
so such Omkara has to be re garded as Prana. In the other the singer
of Udgitha, the Udgatri is called Prana. There fore the two Vidyas are
dif fer ent just as the Upasana of Udgitha as the In fi nite and Su preme
(Parovariya) (Chh. Up. I.9.2). “This is in deed the high est and great -
est” is dif fer ent from the Upasana of Udgitha as golden in form and as
be ing in the eye and in the sun (Chh. Up. I.6).
In the Chhandogya only a part of the Udgitha (hymn), the syl la -
ble OM is med i tated upon as Prana “Let one med i tate on the syl la ble
OM of the Udgitha” (Chh. Up. I.1.1). But in the Brihadaranyaka the
whole Udgitha hymn is med i tated upon as Prana (I.3.2). Hence the
two Vidyas can not be one ow ing to this dif fer ence in the ob ject of
med i ta tion.

The spe cial fea tures of dif fer ent Vidyas are not to be com bined
even when the Vidyas be long to one and the same Sakha; much less
then when they be long to dif fer ent Sakhas.

If it be said (that the Vidyas are one) on account of (the identity
of) name; (we reply that) that is explained (already); moreover
that (identity of name) is (found in the case of admittedly
separate Vidyas).

**Samjnatah:** on account of the name (being same); **Chet:** if; **Tat:** that;
**Uktam:** has already been answered; **Asti:** is, exists; **Tu:** but; **Tat:**
that; **Api:** even, also.

An ar gu ment against the pre ced ing Su tra is re futed.
The word ‘tu’ (but), re moves the doubt raised above.
You can not call them iden ti cal merely be cause they have the
same name. The sub ject mat ter dif fers. This has al ready been es tab -
lished in the last Su tra. For in stance Agnihotra and Darsapurnamasa
are sep a rate and yet have the same name, viz., Kathaka as they are
de scribed in the book called Kathaka. Even the Udgitha Vidya of Chh.
Up. I.6 and Chh. Up. I.9.2 are dif fer ent Vidyas.

It is appropriate to specialise OM by the term ‘Udgitha’

**Vyaptescha samanjasam** III.3.9 ( 368 )

And because (OM) extends (over the whole of the Vedas), (to

**Vyapteh:** because (OM) extends (over the whole of the Vedas); **Cha:**
and; **Samanjasam:** is appropriate, consistent, justifiable.

Su tra 7 is elab o rated here.
In the Sruti ‘ _Omityetadaksharamudgithamupasita_ ’, the use of
the word Udgitha as Viseshana, i.e., ad jec tive of OM is ap pro pri ate,
be cause OM by it self is per va sive in all Srutis and should not be un -
der stood here in its gen eral sense.
In the pas sage “Let a man med i tate on the syl la ble OM as the
Udgitha”, the two words ‘Omkara’ and ‘Udgitha’, are placed in co or di -
na tion. The ques tion then arises whether the re la tion in which the
ideas con veyed by these two words stand to each other is the re la tion
of su per im po si tion (Adhyasa) or sublation (Apavada) or unity
(Ekatva) or spec i fi ca tion (Viseshana).
The word ‘and’ stands here in place of ‘but’ and is meant to dis -
card the three other al ter na tives. The fourth is to be adopted. The

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 380
```

fourth and cor rect view is that the one is Viseshana (an ad jec tive) to

the other as in the words Nila-Utpala (blue lo tus). The pas sage
means that Udgitha is the Viseshana of Omkara. The ap pro pri ate

view of the Chhandogya pas sage is to take the word Udgitha as spe -

cial is ing the term ‘Omkara’.

On account of the non-difference (of the Vidya) everywhere
(i.e., in all the texts of the different Sakhas where the
Prana-Vidya occurs) these qualities (mentioned in two of them
are to be inserted) in the other places (e.g., the Kaushitaki
Upanishad).

**Sarvabhedat:** on account of non-difference everywhere; **Anyatra:** in
the other places; **Ime:** these (qualities are to be inserted).

```
A con crete in stance on the gen eral prin ci ple of Su tra 5 is cited.
In the col lo quy of the Pranas re corded by the Vajasaneyins and
```
the Chhandogyas, the Prana which is en dowed with var i ous qual i ties

such as be ing the best and so on, is rep re sented as the ob ject of med -

i ta tion. Var i ous qual i ties such as be ing the rich est and the like are as -

cribed to speech and the other or gans. These lat ter qual i ties are in

the end at trib uted to the Prana also. “If I am the rich est thou art the
rich est.”
Now in other Sakhas also, as e.g., that of the Kaushitakins the

set of qual i ties such as be ing the best and so on is at trib uted to the

Prana (Katha Up. II.14). But the set of at trib utes, viz., be ing the rich est

and so on is not men tioned.
The ques tion is whether they are to be in serted in the Kaushitaki

also, where they are not men tioned.
This Su tra de clares that they have to be in serted, as the Vidya is

the same in all the three Upanishads. At trib utes be long ing to one and
the same Vidya or sub ject have to be com bined wher ever that Vidya

oc curs al though they may not be ex pressly stated.

Bliss and other attributes (which depict the true nature) of the

Principal or the Supreme Self, i.e., Brahman (have to be
combined from all places in the meditation on Brahman).

**Anandadayah:** Bliss and other attributes; **Pradhanasya:** of the
Principal, i.e., the Supreme Self or Brahman.

Brah man is de scribed as Bliss, Knowl edge, all-per vad ing, the
Self of all, true, etc., in dif fer ent texts of dif fer ent Sakhas. All the at trib -
utes are not men tioned in all places.
Now the ques tion arises whether they have to be com bined in
the med i ta tion on Brah man or not. This Su tra says that they have to
be com bined, as the ob ject of med i ta tion (Brah man) is one and the
same in all Sakhas and there fore the Vidya is one. The rea son for this
con clu sion is the one given in Su tra 10.
The qual i ties at trib uted to Brah man in any one place have to be
com bined when ever Brah man is spo ken of.

(Qualities like) joy being His head, etc., are not to be taken
everywhere, (being subject to) increase and decrease (are

possible only) if there is difference (and not in Brahman in
which there is non-difference).

**Priyasirastvadi:** qualities like joy being His head, etc.; **Apraptih:** are
not to be taken everywhere; **Upachayapachayau:** increase and
decrease; **Hi:** be cause; **Bhede:** (are possible) in difference.
( **Upachaya:** increase; **Apachaya:** decrease.)

The dis cus sion com menced in Su tra 11 is con tin ued, stat ing
here as to which of the at trib utes are not to be culled and com bined
to gether in ev ery form of med i ta tion.
“More” and “less” will ap ply only if there is dif fer en ti a tion. Hence
the de scrip tions of Priyasiras, etc., will not ap ply to Brah man. The de -
scrip tion of Priyasiras (at trib utes like joy be ing His head, etc.) in the
Taittiriya Upanishad are not Dharmas of Brah man but the Dharmas of
the Ananda maya-kosa or the bliss ful sheath. The de scrip tions are
given to turn the mind to wards Brah man. Dif fer ences of higher and
lower in Gunas can come in Upasanas of Saguna Brah man but have
no ap pli ca tion to Nirguna Brah man.
The at trib utes of hav ing joy for His head and such other at trib -
utes are not ac cept able in ev ery form of med i ta tion on Brah man be -
cause at trib ut ing limbs to Brah man would ren der Him li a ble to
fluc tu a tion.
At trib utes like joy be ing His head and so on men tioned in the
Taittiriya Upanishad are not to be taken and com bined in other places

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 382

where the Upasana of Brah man is en joined be cause the suc ces sive
terms, “Joy is Its head”, “sat is fac tion is its right arm”, “great sat is fac -
tion is its left arm”, “bliss is His trunk”, “Brah man is His tail, His sup -
port” (II.5), in di cate qual i ties which have in crease and de crease with
re gard to each other and to other enjoyers (in di vid ual souls or Jivas)
and there fore can ex ist where there is dif fer ence. Now for higher and
lower de grees there is room only where there is plu ral ity or dif fer ence
but Brah man is with out all plu ral ity or dif fer ence, as we know from
many scrip tu ral pas sages (One only, with out a sec ond). There fore
these at trib utes can not con sti tute the na ture of Brah man. They are to
be con fined to the texts which pre scribe them and not taken to other
places.
More over, these qual i ties are at trib uted to the Su preme Brah -
man merely as means of fix ing one’s mind, not as them selves be ing
ob jects of med i ta tion. From this it fol lows that they are not valid ev ery -
where. The at trib utes men tioned in any one are not valid for oth ers.
The case is sim i lar to that of two wives min is ter ing to one king;
one with a fan, the other with an um brella. Here also the ob ject of their
min is tra tions is one, but the acts of min is tra tion them selves are dis -
tinct. They have each their own par tic u lar at trib utes. Sim i lar is the
case un der dis cus sion also.
Qual i ties in which lower and higher de grees can be dis tin -
guished be long to the qual i fied Brah man only in which there is plu ral -
ity, not to the Su preme Nirguna Brah man which is above all
qual i fi ca tions. Such at trib utes as hav ing true de sires (Sat-Kama) and
the like which are men tioned in some par ti c u lar place have no va lid ity
for other med i ta tions on Brah man.

**Itare:** other attributes; **Tu:** but; **Arthasamanyat:** because of common

The pre vi ous dis cus sion is con tin ued.
But at trib utes like Bliss, knowl edge, all-pervadingness, etc.,
which de scribe the na ture of Brah man, are to be com bined as the ob -

These at trib utes which scrip ture sets for the pur pose of teach -

Adhyanadhikaranam: Topic 7 (Sutras 14-15)
Katha Up. I.3.10-11 teaches merely that the Self is
higher than everything else
```
**AmÜ`mZm` à`moOZm^mdmV²Ÿ&**

**Adhyanaya prayojanabhavat** III.3.14 (373)
(The passage in Katha Upanishad I.3.10 tells about the Self
only as the highest) for the sake of pious meditation, as there is
no use (of the knowledge of the objects being higher than the
senses and so on).

**Adhyanaya:** for the sake of meditation; **Prayojanabhavat:** as there
is no use, as there is no other necessity. ( **Prayojana:** of any other
purpose; **Abhavat:** on account of the absence.)

The pre vi ous dis cus sion is con tin ued.
We read in the Kathaka (I.3.10-11), “Higher than the senses are
the ob jects, higher than the ob jects there is the mind,” etc., “higher
than the At man there is noth ing, this is the goal, the high est road.”
Here the doubt arises whether the pur port of the pas sage is to
in ti mate that each of the things suc ces sively enu mer ated is higher
than the pre ced ing one, or only that the At man is higher than all of
them.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent holds the for mer al ter na tive
be cause the text ex pressly de clares the ob jects to be higher than the
senses, the mind higher than the ob jects and so on. He main tains that
these sen tences are sep a rate and not one as re fer ring to the At man
alone. There fore the pur pose of the text is to teach that the ob jects
are su pe rior to the senses and so on.
This Su tra re futes it and de clares that it is one sen tence and
means that the At man is su pe rior to all these.
The ob ject of the Sruti is not to say that each later cat e gory is
higher than the for mer, be cause there is no spir i tual gain or any use ful
pur pose in such a dec la ra tion. The aim is to de clare that Brah man is
higher than all, as such knowl edge leads to Moksha.
The At man alone is to be known, be cause the Knowl edge gives
free dom or the fi nal re lease. The scrip ture also says “He who has per -
ceived that, is freed from the jaws of death” (Katha Up. I.3.15).
Fur ther, the text in ti mates high est rev er ence for the At man by
de clar ing that noth ing is higher than the At man and that He is the
high est goal and thereby shows that the whole se ries of ob jects is
enu mer ated only for the pur pose of giv ing in for ma tion about the At -
man. This in for ma tion is given for the sake of med i ta tion on the At man
which re sults in the knowl edge of it.

And on account of the word Atman.

**Atmasabdat:** on account of the word ‘Atma’; **Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 14 is given.
The above con clu sion is con firmed by the fact that the sub ject of
dis cus sion is called the Self or At man. “That Self is hid den in all be -
ings and does not shine forth, but it is seen by sub tle seers through
their sharp and sub tle in tel lect” (Katha Up. I.3.2). From this we con -
clude that the text wishes to rep re sent the other things enu mer ated as
the non-Self.
“A wise man should keep down speech and mind” (Katha Up.
I.3.13). This pas sage en joins pi ous med i ta tion as a means of the
Knowl edge of the Su preme Self. It thus fol lows that the Sruti in di cates
var i ous excellences in the case of the At man only and not in that of
the other things enu mer ated.
The text “He reaches the end of his jour ney and that is the high -
est place of Vishnu” sug gests the ques tion as to who is the end of the
jour ney and we there fore con clude that the enu mer a tion of the
senses, ob jects, etc., has merely the pur pose of teach ing the high est
place of Vishnu and not of teach ing any thing about the re la tion of the
senses, ob jects and so on.
But the enu mer a tion of the senses is not al to gether use less. It
en ables the as pi rant to turn the out go ing mind to wards the In ner Self
or the At man. This sub tle At man can not be at tained with out ab strac -
tion, in tro spec tion and pro found med i ta tion.

**Atmagrihitih:** the Supreme Self is meant; **Itaravat:** as in other texts

qualification.

We read in the Aitareya Upanishad “Ver ily in the be gin ning all
this was the Self, one only; there was noth ing else what so ever” (I.1).
Here the doubt arises whether the term “Self” de notes the Su preme
Self or some other be ing such as Hiranyagarbha.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 385

It re fers to the Su preme Self, even as the word “Self” in other
texts which treat of cre ation re fers to It, and not to Hiranyagarbha.
“From the Self ether was pro duced” (Tait. Up. II.1). Why? Be cause in
the sub se quent text of the Aitareya we have “It thought shall I send
forth worlds? It sent forth these worlds” (Ait. Up. I.1.2). This qual i fi ca -
tion, viz., that “It thought” be fore cre ation is ap plied to Brah man in the
pri mary sense in other Sruti pas sages. Hence we con clude from this
that the Self re fers to the Su preme Self or Para Brah man and not to
Hiranyagarbha, or any other Be ing.

If it be said that because of the context (the Supreme Self is not

**Anvayat:** because of connection, because of the context; **Iti:** this, so;
**Chet:** if; **Syat:** it might be so; **Avadharanat:** on account of the definite

The Su tra con sists of two parts namely an ob jec tion and its re -
ply. The ob jec tion is ‘ _Anvayaditi chet_ ’ the re ply is _‘Syad-avadharanat’_.
The ref er ence is to Para Brah man or the High est Self. The word
“Asit” shows that the ref er ence is to Para Brah man alone, be cause
He alone ex isted be fore all cre ation. The Lokasrishti or cre ation of the
world is only af ter the Mahabhutasrishti or cre ation of the five great el -
e ments.
The Purvapakshin says: “In the Aitareya Upanishad (I.1), it is
stated that Brah man cre ated the four worlds. But it is said in the
Taittiriya and other texts that Brah man cre ated ether, air, fire, wa ter
and earth, the five el e ments. It is only Hiranyagarbha that cre ates the
world with the aid of the el e ments cre ated by the High est Self. Hence
the Self in the Aitareya Upanishad can not mean the Su preme Self but
only Hiranyagarbha or the Karya-Brah man.”
This Su tra re futes it and de clares that on ac count of the state -
ment “Ver ily, in the be gin ning all this was the Self, one only” (Ait. Up.
I.1.) which in ti mates that there was one only with out a sec ond, it can
only re fer to the High est Self or Para Brah man and not to
Hiranyagarbha, the Karya-Brah man. The High est Self cre ated the
four worlds af ter cre at ing the el e ments as de scribed in other Sakhas.
The at trib utes of Para Brah man or the High est Self which are men -

Upasana of Chhandogya Upanishad is not the Achamana, as such.
Achamana is en joined by the Smritis and is com mon to all. What is or -

In the Chhandogya Upanishad (V.2.2) and the Brihadaranyaka

This Su tra states that the act of rins ing the mouth is al ready or -

In the Agnirahasya in the Vajasaneyi Sakha there is a Vidya
called Sandilya Vidya, in which oc curs the pas sage “Let him med i tate
on the Self which con sists of mind, which has the Prana for its body,
and light for its form” (Sat. Br. Madhy. 10.6.3.2). Again, in the
Brihadaranyaka (V.10.6) which be longs to the same Sakha we have
“That per son con sist ing of mind, whose be ing is light, is within the
heart, small like a grain of rice or bar ley. He is the ruler of all, the Lord
of all—He rules all this what so ever ex ists.”
A doubt here pres ents it self whether these two pas sages are to
be taken as one Vidya in which the par tic u lars men tioned in ei ther text
are to be com bined or not. Are they one Vidya or dif fer ent Vidyas?
This Su tra de clares that, they are one Vidya, as the ob ject of
med i ta tion (Upasya) is the same in both. The ob ject of med i ta tion in
both is the Self con sist ing of mind. The com bin ing of the par tic u lars of
a sim i lar Vidya in the same Sakha is the same as in the case of such
Vidyas which oc cur in dif fer ent Sakhas. Al though the two pas sages
be long to one and the same Sakha, they yet con sti tute the Vidya only
and their par tic u lars have to be com bined into one whole. The for mer
di rects wor ship, by means of such Vidya. The lat ter gives its Gunas
(fea tures).
Though there is some dif fer ence in mi nor de tails, the two de -
scrip tions of the Sandilya Vidya in the two Srutis are prac ti cally the
same. So, a par tic u lar point men tioned in one Sruti in con nec tion with
the Sandilya Vidya has to be in cor po rated with the other, if it be not

This Su tra is a Purvapaksha Su tra. It sets forth the view of the

We read in the Brihadaranyaka (V.5.1-2), “Satya (the truth) is
Brah man. That which is Satya is that Sun—the be ing who is in that
orb and the be ing who is in the right eye”. This gives the abode of the
Satya Brah man with re spect to the gods and the body. The text

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 388

teaches the two se cret names of the Satya Brah man in con nec tion
with these abodes. “Its se cret name is ‘Ahar’ with ref er ence to the
gods, and its se cret name is ‘Aham’ with ref er ence to the body.”
A doubt here arises whether these two se cret names are both to
be ap plied to the Deva-abode of Brah man as well as to its bodily
abode, or only one name to each.
Now on the anal ogy of the Sandilya Vidya, the par tic u lars must
be com bined as the ob ject of med i ta tion, viz., the Satya Brah man is
one. There fore both the names ‘Ahar’ and ‘Aham’ have to be com -

Both the se cret names equally be long to the Aditya as well as to

orb and the eye-ball are too dis tant and dis tant abodes for the wor ship
of Brah man, the two sig nif i cant names ‘Ahar’ and ‘Aham’ re ferred to
in the pre vi ous Su tra, should not both be em ployed in the same form
of med i ta tion. Each name re fers to a dif fer ent lo cus of Upasana.
Though the Vidya is one, still on ac count of dif fer ence in places
the ob ject of med i ta tion be comes dif fer ent. There fore there are dif fer -
ent names. Hence these can not be ex changed or com bined.
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent raises an ob jec tion. He
says: The per son within the orb of the sun and the per son within the
eye are one only, be cause the text teaches that both are abodes of
the one true Brah man.
True, we re ply, but as each se cret name is taught only with ref er -
ence to the one Brah man and con di tioned by a par tic u lar state, the
name ap plies to Brah man only in so far as it is in that state. Here is an
anal ogy. The teacher al ways re mains the teacher; yet those kinds of
ser vices which the pu pil has to do to the teacher when sit ting have not
to be done when he stands and vice versa.
The com par i son given by the op po nent is not well cho sen as the
du ties of the dis ci ple to wards his teacher de pend on the lat ter’s char -
ac ter as teacher and that is not changed by his be ing ei ther in the vil -
lage or in the for est.
There fore, the two se cret names ‘Ahar’ and ‘Aham’ have to be
held apart. They can not be com bined.

For the same reason (as in the previous Sutra) the support ing

(of the world) and pervading the sky (attributed to Brahman in

the Ranayaniya Khila) also (are not to be included in other

Vidyas or Upasanas of Brahman).

**Sambhriti:** supporting the world; **Dyuvyapti:** pervading the sky; **Api:**
also; **Cha:** and; **Atah:** for the same reason (as in the previous Sutra).
( **Dyu:** the sky, all the space, heaven).

A re stric tion to Su tra 5 is made.
In a sup ple men tary text of the Ranayaniyas we meet with a pas -
sage, “The pow ers, which were col lected to gether, were pre ceded by
Brah man; the pre-ex is tent Brah man in the be gin ning per vaded the
whole sky.”
Now these two qual i ties ‘Sambhriti’ and ‘Dyuvyapti’ are not to be
in serted or in cluded in the Sandilya Vidya and other Vidyas for the
same rea son as is given in the last Su tra, viz., dif fer ence of abode. In
the Sandilya Vidya, Brah man is said to have its abode in the heart “He
is the Self within the heart” (Chh. Up. III.14.3). The same state ment is
made in the Dahara-Vidya “There is the pal ace, the small lo tus of the
heart, and in it that small ether” (VIII.1.1). In the Upakosala-Vidya,
again, Brah man is said to abide within the eye “That per son that is
seen in the eye” (IV.15.1).
Fur ther these qual i ties and those men tioned in other Vidyas like
the Sandilya Vidya are of such a na ture as to ex clude each other and
are not sug ges tive of each other. The mere fact of cer tain Vidyas be -
ing con nected with Brah man does not con sti tute their unity. It is an es -

tab lished fact that Brah man, al though one only, is ow ing to the

The con clu sion, there fore, is that the at trib utes of hold ing to -
gether its pow ers (Sambhriti and Dyuvyapti) are not to be in serted in
the Sandilya and sim i lar Vidyas, and that the Upasana re ferred to in
this Su tra is an in de pend ent Vidya by it self. The Sandilya Vidya re fers
to the wor ship of At man in the heart and the Upakosala-Vidya re fers
to the wor ship of the At man in the eye, whereas the above at trib utes

**Purushavidyayamiva chetareshamanamnanat** III.3.24 (383)

And (as the qualities) as (mentioned) in the Purusha-Vidya (of
the Chhandogya) are not mentioned (in that) of the others (i.e.,
in the Taittiriya) (the two Purusha-Vidyas are not one; are not
to be combined).

**Parushavidyayamiva:** as in the Purusha-Vidya (of the
Chhandogya); **Cha:** and; **Itaresham:** of the others; **Anamnanat:**
because of not being mentioned (in the Taittiriya).

The Purusha Vidya of the Chhandogya Upanishad and that of
the Taittiriya Upanishad are now ex am ined.
In the Rahasya-Brahmana of the Tandins and the Paingins (the
Chhandogya) there is a Vidya treat ing of man in which man is iden ti -
fied with the sac ri fice, the three pe ri ods of his life with the three li ba -
tions “Man is the sac ri fice”.
In the Taittiriya Aranyaka (X.64) also oc curs a sim i lar Vidya “For
him who knows thus the self of the sac ri fice is the sac ri ficer, faith
(Sraddha) is the wife of the sac ri ficer,” etc.
The doubt here arises whether the two Vidyas are one, whether
the par tic u lars of the man-sac ri fice given in the Chhandogya are to be
in serted in the Taittiriya or not.
The fun da men tal at trib ute re ferred to is that man is iden ti fied
with sac ri fice in both. This Su tra de clares that in spite of this, the two
Vidyas are not one, be cause the de tails dif fer. The char ac ter is tics of
the Purusha-Yajna of the Chhandogyas are not re cog nised in the
Taittiriya text. The Taittiriya ex hib its an iden ti fi ca tion of man with the
sac ri fice in which the wife, the sac ri ficer, the Veda, the Vedi, the sac ri -
fi cial grass, the post, the but ter, the sac ri fi cial an i mal, the priest etc.,
are men tioned in suc ces sion. These par tic u lars are not men tion ed in
the Chhandogya.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 391
```

The two texts agree in iden ti fi ca tion of the Avabhritha cer e mony
with death. There are greater num ber of dis sim i lar i ties. The Taittiriya
does not rep re sent man as the sac ri fice as the Chhandogya does.
More over the re sult of the Vidya in the Taittiriya is the at tain ment
of the great ness of Brah man: “He ob tains the great ness of Brah man”.
The re sult of the Vidya in Chhandogya is long life, “He who knows this
lives on to a hun dred and six teen years.”
There fore, the two Vidyas are sep a rate. “The par tic u lars can not
be com bined in the two places. The par tic u lars men tioned in the
Purusha-Vidya of Chhandogya, such as for mu las of prayer, Mantras
and so on are not to be com bined with the Taittiriya text of the Vidya.

**Vedhadyarthabhedat** III.3.25 (384)
Because the matter (of certain Mantras) such as piercing and
so on is different (from the matter of the approximate Vidyas),
(the former are not to be combined with the latter).

**Vedhadi:** piercing etc.; **Arthabhedat:** because they have a different
meaning.

Cer tain ex pres sions oc cur ring at the be gin ning of an Upanishad
of the Atharva-Veda are taken up for dis cus sion.
At the be gin ning of the Upanishad of the Atharvanikas we have
“Pierce the whole (body of the en emy), pierce his heart, crush his
veins, crush his head” etc. At the be gin ning of the Upanishad of the
Tandins we have the Man tra “O God Savita! pro duce the sac ri fice”. At
the be gin ning of Kathas and the Taittiriyaka we have “May Mitra be
pro pi tious to us and Varuna etc.” At the be gin ning of that of the
Kaushitakins we have “Brah man in deed is the Agnistoma, Brah man
is that day; through Brah man they pass into Brah man, Im mor tal ity,
those reach who ob serve that day.”
The ques tion is whether these Mantras and the sac ri fices re -
ferred to in the Brahmanas in close prox im ity to the Upanishads are to
be com bined with the Vidyas pre scribed by these Upanishads.
The op po nent holds that they are to be com bined, be cause the
text ex hib its them in prox im ity to the Upanishad-por tions of the
Brahmanas whose chief con tents are formed by the Vidyas. In the
case of Mantras we can al ways imag ine some mean ing which con -
nects them with the Vidyas. The first Man tra quoted glo ri fies the
heart, be cause the heart is of ten rep re sented in the Vidyas as abode
of med i ta tion. There fore Mantras which glo rify the heart may con sti -
tute sub or di nate mem bers of those Vidyas.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 392
```

This Su tra de clares that they are not to be com bined be cause
their mean ing is dif fer ent, as they in di cate acts of a sac ri fice and so
have no as so ci a tion or re la tion ship with the Vidyas.
The Mantras might be so em ployed if their whole con tents were
glo ri fi ca tion of the heart, but this is not the case. The Man tra first
quoted clearly ex presses en mity to some body and is there fore not to
be con nected with the Vidyas of the Upanishads, but with some cer e -
mony meant to de stroy one’s en emy.
Other Mantras are sub or di nate to cer tain sac ri fi cial ac tions.
They can not, be cause they oc cur in the Upanishads, be con nect ed
with the Vidyas on the ground of mere prox im ity.
For this rea son the men tioned Mantras and acts are not on the
ground of mere tex tual col lo ca tion to be viewed as sup ple men tary to
the Vidyas of the Upanishads.

But where only the getting rid (of the good and evil) is
mentioned (the obtaining of this good and evil by others has to
be added) because the statement about acceptance is
supplementary (to the statement about the getting rid of) as in
the case of the Kusas, metres, praise and hymns or recitations.
This (i.e., the reason for this) has been stated (by Jaimini in
Purvamimamsa).

**Hanau:** where only the getting rid (of good and evil) is mentioned; **Tu:**
but; **Upayanasabdaseshatvat:** on account of the word ‘acceptance’
being supplementary to the word ‘getting rid’;
**Kusacchandastutyupaganavat:** like Kusa-sticks, metres, praises

( **Upayana:** acceptance; **Sabda:** on account of the statement of the
word; **Seshatvat:** on account of being supplementary to.)

Here is a dis cus sion on the shak ing off of vir tues and vices by
the re leased soul at death and their ac cep tance by his friends and en -
e mies.
Jaimini has said that state ments with re spect to Kusas, metres,
praises and hymns have to be com pleted from other texts. It is said in
the Kaushitaki Sruti that Kusa sticks are to be col lected from trees
with out any spec i fi ca tion as to what sort of tree; but in the Satyayana
branch it is said that the Kusas are of the Udumbara tree. This lat ter

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 393
```

ex pres sion is to be ac cepted as com ple men tary to the for mer ex pres -
sion of the Kaushitaki Sruti. The first Sruti will have to be com pleted in
the light of the other.
There is in a Sruti an in junc tion to say a prayer com posed in
metre with out any spec i fi ca tion of the kind of metre, but in an other
place there is men tion of the Deva-metre to be em ployed in such a
case. There fore the Deva-metre is to be un der stood in the pre vi ous
case also.
There is in struc tion in one Sruti to ut ter praises for the sac ri fi cial
ves sel ‘Shodasi’ with out spec i fy ing the time as to when it should be
per formed; but in an other Sruti it is taught to be per formed when the
sun has risen. Here the lat ter in struc tion is to be ac cepted as sup ple -
men tary to the for mer.
As re gards the hymn it is not def i nitely stated which of the four
priests is to join in the sing ing of the prayer in a sac ri fice; but this
doubt has been cleared up by a par tic u lar text which says that the
Adhvaryu will not join in the sing ing. Putt ing the two state ments to -
gether, the con clu sion is that all the priests ex cept the Adhvaryu will
join.
This prin ci ple is here ap plied to the ef fects of the ac tions of a lib -
er ated sage in con nec tion with the Vidyas men tioned in the
Upanishads. In the text of the Tandins we find “shakes off all evil as a
horse shakes his hair, and shak ing off the body as the moon frees
her self from the mouth of Rahu, I ob tain the uncreated world of Brah -
man” (Chh. Up. VIII.13). Again in Mundaka Upanishad (III.1.3) we
read “Then know ing shak ing off good and evil, he reaches the high est
one ness, free from pas sion.” These Srutis are si lent on the point as to
who ac cepts his good and evil deeds.
In the Satyayana branch of Sruti it is said “His sons ob tain his in -
her i tance, his friends the good, his en e mies the evil he has done.” In
the Kaushitaki Upanishad (I.4) we find “He shakes off his good and
his bad deeds. His be loved re la tions ob tain the good, his un be loved
rel a tives the evil he has done.”
This Su tra de clares that the ob tain ing of the good and evil by his
friends and en e mies has to be in serted or nec es sar ily added in the
Chhandogya text and Mundaka text ac cord ing to Jaimini’s prin ci ple
ex plained above.
The Purvapakshin raises an other ob jec tion. He ar gues that the
verb ‘Dhu’ in the text of the Chhandogya and Kaushitaki may be in ter -
preted as ‘trem bling’ and not as ‘get ting rid of’. It would mean there -
fore that good and evil still cling to a per son who at tains Knowl edge,
al though their ef fects are re tarded on ac count of the Knowl edge.
This Su tra de clares that such a mean ing is in cor rect, be cause
the sub se quent por tion of the text in di cates that oth ers ob tain the

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 394
```

good and evil. This is cer tainly not pos si ble un less the per son who at -
tains Knowl edge aban dons them.
Good and evil deeds can not be said to ‘trem ble’ in the lit eral
sense of the word like flags in the wind, as they are not of a sub stan tial
na ture. Though ‘Dhu’ in ‘Vidhuya’ may be said to sig nify ‘shak ing’ and
not ‘cast ing off’, yet as oth ers are de scribed as tak ing the lib er ated
sage’s mer its and sins, it means ‘cast ing off’.

(He who attains knowledge gets rid of his good and evil deeds)
at the time of death, there being nothing to be attained (by him
on the way to Brahmaloka through those works); for thus
others (declare in their sacred texts).

**Samparaye:** at the time of death; **Tarttavyabhavat:** there being
nothing to be attained; **Tatha:** in this way, so; **Hi:** because, for; **Anye:**
others.

This Su tra de cides when the in di vid ual soul shakes off his good
and evil deeds.
The ques tion now arises as to when the in di vid ual soul gets rid
of his good and evil deeds. In the Kaushitaki Upanishad (I.4) we find
“He co mes to the river Viraja and crosses it by the mind alone, and
there he shakes off good and evil.” On the strength of this text the
Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains that the good and evil deeds
are dis carded on his way to Brahmaloka and not at the time of de part -
ing from the body.
This Su tra re futes it and de clares that the lib er ated sage frees
him self from the ef fects of good and evil works at the time of death
through the strength of his knowl edge.
Though the Kaushitaki Sruti re fers to the dis card ing of good and
evil on the Devayana way or the way to Brahmaloka, af ter cross ing
the Viraja river, the good and evil deeds are cast off at death, be cause
there is noth ing to be at tained through them af ter death, there re main -
ing noth ing to be en joyed by him through his good and evil works. The
good and evil works are no lon ger of any use to him and not fit to be
re tained by him there af ter.
The Sanchita Karma or ac cu mu lated works are de stroyed as
soon as one at tains knowl edge of Brah man. Prarabdha is de stroyed
at death. So he is freed from the ef fects of all his mer its and sins at the
time of death.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 395
```

```
As the re sults of his good and evil deeds are con trary to the re -

sult of knowl edge, they are de stroyed by the power of the lat ter. The

mo ment of their de struc tion is that mo ment in which he sets out to -

wards the fruit of his knowl edge, i.e., the world of Brah man.
More over it is not pos si ble to cast off the ef fects of good and evil

deeds on the way to Brahmaloka be cause the soul has no gross body

and so it can not take re course to any prac tice that can de stroy them.
Fur ther one can not cross the river Viraja un less he is freed from

all good and evil.
The Sruti de clares “shak ing off all evil as a horse shakes off his

hairs” (Chh. Up. VIII.13.1).
There fore the set tled con clu sion is that all good and evil works

are cast off at the time of death.

**Chhandatah:** according to his liking; **Ubhayavirodhat:** on account of
there being harmony between the two. ( **Ubhaya:** of either;
**Avirodhat:** there being no contradiction.)

```
The view is cor rect be cause vol un tary per for mance of Yama,

Niyma, etc., to get rid of Karma is pos si ble only be fore death, and be -

cause it is op posed to all texts. The above view is in agree ment or uni -

If the soul frees him self from his good and evil deeds on the way

af ter hav ing de parted from the body and hav ing en tered on the way of

the gods (Devayana), we land our selves in im pos si bil i ties, be cause

af ter the body has been left be hind, he can not prac tise ac cord ing to

his lik ing self-re straint and pur suit of knowl edge which can ef fect de -

It does not cer tainly stand to rea son that the ef fect is de layed till

(The soul’s) journey (along the path of the gods, Devayana) is

**Gateh:** of the journey of the soul (after death), along the path of the
gods; **Arthavatvam:** utility; **Ubhayatha:** in two ways; **Anyatha:**
otherwise; **Hi:** for, certainly; **Virodhah:** contradiction.

Here is a side is sue of Su tra 27.
In some scrip tural texts the dead man’s go ing on the path of the
gods is men tioned in con nec tion with his free ing him self from good
and evil. In other texts it is not men tioned. The doubt now arises
whether the two things go to gether in all cases or only in cer tain
cases.
The Purvapakshin holds that the two are to be con nected in all
cases, just as the man’s free ing him self from his good and evil works
is al ways fol lowed by their pass ing over to his friends and en e mies.
This Su tra de clares that the wor ship per of Saguna Brah man
only takes jour ney af ter death along the Devayana. The go ing on that
path has a sense in the case of Saguna Upasana only and not in wor -
ship pers of Nirguna Brah man. Brahmaloka is lo cated else where in
space. The Saguna Upasaka has to move and at tain that abode.
There is ac tual go ing through which an other place is reached. There -
fore, the jour ney has a mean ing in his case only. The Prana of
Nirguna Upasaka is ab sorbed in Brah man. He is one with the In fi nite
or the Ab so lute. Where will he move? The lib er ated sage who is free
from all de sires and ego ism does not go to an other place. He does
not move. The Su preme Brah man is not to be reached by the lib er -
ated sage. He need not trans port him self to an other lo cal ity. There is
no mean ing at all in jour ney for such a sage who is ab sorbed in
Nirguna Brah man. His ig no rance is de stroyed by the dawn of knowl -
edge of Brah man. He be comes iden ti cal with the Su preme Self. If
there is jour ney for him also, then it would con tra dict Sruti texts like
“Shak ing off good and evil, free from pas sions, he reaches the High -
est Self, or Para-Brah man” (Mun. Up. III.1.3).
How can the lib er ated sage who has be come one with the Su -
preme Brah man who is secondless, who is all-per vad ing, who is In fi -
nite, who is with out mo tion, go to an other place by Devayana? He has
al ready at tained his goal or un ion with Brah man. The jour ney along
the Devayana is mean ing less for him.

(The two-fold view taken above) is justified because we observe
a purpose characterised thereby (i.e., a purpose of the going)
as in ordinary life.

**Upapannah:** is reasonable; **Tallakshanarthopalabdheh:** for the
characteristics which render such journey possible are seen;
**Lokavat:** as is seen in the world, as is the ordinary experience. ( **Tat:**
that; **Lakshana:** mark, characteristic features; **Artha:** object;
**Upalabdheh:** being known, on account of the obtaining.)

The pre vi ous dis cus sion is con tin ued.
The med i ta tions on Saguna or qual i fied Brah man, such as the
Paryankavidya of the Kaushitaki Upanishad, there is a rea son for the
man’s pro ceed ing on the path of the gods (Devayana); be cause the
text men tions cer tain re sults which can be at tained only by the man
go ing to dif fer ent places, such as his mount ing a couch, his hold ing
con ver sa tion with Brah man seated on a couch, his ex pe ri enc ing var i -
ous odours and so on.
On the con trary go ing on the path of the gods has noth ing to do
with per fect knowl edge. No pur pose is served by such a jour ney in the
case of a lib er ated sage or Nirguna Upasaka in whom ig no rance has
been de stroyed by the dawn of knowl edge of Brah man or the Im per -
ish able. He has at tained one ness or unity with the Su preme Self. All
his de sires have been ful filled. All his Kar mas have been de stroyed.
He is only wait ing for the dis so lu tion of the body.
The de struc tion is sim i lar to what is ob served in or di nary life. If
we wish to reach some vil lage we have to pro ceed on a path lead ing
there, but no mov ing on a path is needed when we want to at tain free -

We have shown that the go ing on the path of the gods is valid

such as the Madhu Vidya, the Sandilya Vidya, the Shodasakala
Vidya, the Vaisvanara Vidya.
The doubt now arises whether the go ing on the path of the gods
is to be con nected with those Vidyas in which it is ac tu ally men tioned
or gen er ally with all Vidyas of that kind.
This Su tra de clares that all wor ship pers of the Saguna Brah -
man, what ever their Vidyas may be, go af ter death by this path. This is
seen from the Sruti and Smriti. “Those who med i tate thus through
Panchagni Vidya and also those who un der stand other Vidyas and
also those who med i tate in the for est with faith and aus teri ties, on
Saguna Brah man through any other Vidya pro ceed on the path of the
gods” (Chh. Up. V.10.1.); (Bri. Up. VI.2.15).
Bhagavad Gita also de clares, “Light and dark ness, these are
thought to be the world’s ev er last ing paths; by the one he goes who
does not re turn, by the other he re turns again” (VIII.26).
The term “The True” in the pas sage “Those who in the for est,
with faith, wor ship the True”, i.e., Brah man, is of ten em ployed to de -
note Brah man.
Thus it is quite clear that the go ing on the path of gods is not
con fined to those Vidyas in which it is ac tu ally men tioned or ex pressly
stated.

CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 399
```

The Purvapakshin says: Rishi Apantaratamas, a teacher of the
Vedas was by the or der of Vishnu, born on this earth as Vyasa or
Krishna Dvaipayana. Sim i larly Vasishtha, the son of Brahma’s mind
hav ing parted from for mer body in con se quence of the curse of Nimi,
was on the or der of Brahma, again pro cre ated by Mitra and Varuna.
Bhrigu and other sons of Brahma’s mind were again born at the sac ri -
fice of Varuna. Sanatkumara also, who like wise was a son of
Brahma’s mind, was in con se quence of a boon be ing granted to
Rudra, born again as Skanda. Daksha, Narada and other Rishis were
born again. It is stated that some as sumed a new body af ter the old
body had per ished, some as sumed through their su per nat u ral pow -
ers var i ous new bod ies while the old body re mained in tact all the
while.
Now these Rishis had knowl edge of Brah man or the Ab so lute
and yet they had to be re born. If this is the case what is the use of
such knowl edge of Brah man? The knowl edge of Brah man may ei ther
be or not be the cause of fi nal eman ci pa tion or free dom.
The Su tra re futes it and de clares that or di narily a per son is not
re born af ter at tain ing knowl edge of the Ab so lute. But the case of
those who have a di vine mis sion to ful fil is dif fer ent. They may have
one or more births till their mis sion is ful filled, af ter which they are not
born again. They are en trusted with the of fices con du cive to the sub -
sis tence of the world such as the pro mul ga tion of the Vedas and the
like. They as sume new bod ies of their own free will and not as the re -
sult of Karma. They pass from one body to an other, as if from one
house into an other in or der to ac com plish the du ties of their of fices.
They pre serve all the true mem ory of their iden tity. They cre ate for
them selves, through their power over the ma te rial of the body and the
sense or gans, new bod ies and oc cupy them ei ther all at once or in
suc ces sion.
Smriti tells us that Sulabha, a woman who had knowl edge of
Brah man, wanted to en ter into dis cus sion with Janaka. She left her
own body, en tered into that of Janaka, car ried on a dis cus sion with
him and again re turned into her own body.
“ _Tat Tvam Asi_ ” (That thou art) does not mean “ _Tat Tvam Mrito
Bhavishyasi_ ” (they will be come That af ter death). It can not be in ter -
preted to mean “Thou wilt be that af ter thou hast dead.” An other text
de clares that the fruit of Knowl edge viz., un ion with Brah man springs
up at the mo ment when the com plete knowl edge of Brah man is at -
tained. The Rishi Vamadeva saw and un der stood it sing ing, “I was
Manu, I was the sun.”
But they never come un der the sway of Avidya or ne science
even though they may be born. The case is sim i lar to that of a lib er -
ated sage. A Jivanmukta con tin ues his phys i cal ex is tence even af ter
at tain ing Brahma Jnana or Knowl edge of the Ab so lute as long as the

```

```

Prarabdha Karma lasts. The di vine mis sion of these Rishis like Sri
Vyasa, Vasishtha, Apantaratamas, can be com pared to the

Prarabdha Karma of Jivanmuktas.
For all these rea sons it is es tab lished that those who are en -
dowed with true and per fect knowl edge at tain in all cases fi nal eman -
ci pa tion.

**Aksharadhiyam tvavarodhah

But the conceptions of the (negative) attributes of the
Imperishable (Brahman) are to be combined (from different
texts where the Imperishable Brahman is dealt with, as they
form one Vidya), because of the similarity (of defining the
Imperishable Brahman through denials) and the object (the
Imperishable Brahman) being the same, as in the case of the
Upasad (offerings). This has been explained (by Jaimini in the
Purvamimamsa).

**Aksharadhiyam:** of the meditation of negative attributes belonging to
the Imperishable; **Tu:** but, indeed; **Avarodhah:** combination;
**Samanyatadbhavabhyam:** because of the similarity (of denying
Brahman through denials) and the object (viz., Imperishable
Brahman) being the same; **Aupasadavat:** as in the case of the
Upasad (offering) like the hymn or the Mantra in connection with the
Upasada rite; **Tat:** that; **Uktam:** has been explained (by Jaimini in the
Purvamimamsa).

The neg a tive at trib utes of the Im per ish able are now ex am in ed,
as the pos i tive at trib utes were ex am ined in Su tra 11 of this Sec tion.
We read in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, “O Gargi! The
Brahmanas or the knowers of Brah man call this Akshara or the Im -

per ish able. It is nei ther gross nor sub tle, nei ther short nor long” (Bri.
Up. III.8.8). Again the Mundaka says, “The Su preme Knowl edge is

that by which the Im per ish able (Akshara) is at tained.” “That which is
imperceivable, ungraspable, which has no fam ily and no caste” etc.
(Mun. Up. I.1.5-6). In other places also the high est Brah man, un der

the name of Akshara is de scribed as that of which all qual i ties are to
be de nied.
A doubt arises now as to whether the neg a tive qual i ties in the

above two texts are to be com bined so as to form one Vidya or they
are to be treated as two sep a rate Vidyas.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 401
```

The Purvapakshin main tains that each de nial is valid only for
that pas sage in which the text ac tu ally ex hib its it, and not for other
places. These neg a tive at trib utes do not di rectly in di cate or spec ify
the na ture of Brah man like the pos i tive at trib utes, Bliss, Peace,
Knowl edge, Truth, Pu rity, Per fec tion, Eter nity, etc. Hence the prin ci -
ple stated in Su tra III.3.11 does not ap ply here, be cause no pur pose is
re ally served or gained by such a com bi na tion.
This Su tra re futes this and de clares that such de ni als are to be
com bined be cause the method of teach ing Brah man through de nial
is the same and the ob ject of in struc tion is also the same, viz., the Im -
per ish able Brah man (Akshara). The rule of Su tra III.3.11 ap plies here
also. In Su tra III.3.11 pos i tive at trib utes of Brah man were dis cussed.
Here we are con cerned with neg a tive at trib utes which teach Brah -
man by an in di rect method. The case is sim i lar to the Upasad of fer -
ings. The Mantras for giv ing these of fer ings are found only in the
Sama Veda. But the priests of the Yajur Veda use this Man tra given in
the other Veda. The hymns which oc cur in the Sama Veda are re cited
by the Adhvaryu af ter the time of the Yajur Veda. This prin ci ple has
been es tab lished by Jaimini in Purvamimamsa (III.3. 9).
Sim i larly the neg a tive at trib utes have to be com bined here also
in the med i ta tion on the Im per ish able Brah man (Akshara).
The con cep tion of the neg a tive at trib utes of the In de struc ti ble
(Akshara) as stated in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is to be re -
tained in the med i ta tions on the In de struc ti ble ev ery where (i.e., in ev -

Because (the same thing) is described as such and such.

**Iyat:** so much only, this much; **Amananat:** on account of being

We read in the Mundaka Upanishad “Two birds of beau ti ful
plum age, in sep a ra ble friends, cling to the same tree. One of them
eats the sweet and bit ter fruits there of, the other looks on with out eat -
ing” (Mun. Up. III.1.1). The same Man tra is found in the text of
Svetasvatara Upanishad (IV.6).
Again we have, “There are the two en joy ing the fruits of their

house hold ers who per form the Trinachiketa sac ri fice” (Katha Up.
I.3.1).
The doubt here arises, do we have in these two texts two dif fer -
ent Vidyas or one only?
The Purvapakshin or the op po nent main tains that these are two
Vidyas, be cause there are dif fer ent ob jects of med i ta tion. The
Mundaka text de clares that only one eats the fruit, while the other
does not. Katha text says that both of them en joy the fruits of their
good ac tions. So the ob ject of med i ta tion is not the same. As the ob -
jects of knowl edge dif fer in char ac ter, the Vidyas them selves must be
looked upon as sep a rate.
This Su tra re futes it and de clares that they form one Vidya, be -
cause both de scribe the same Lord as ex ist ing thus and thus, i.e. in
the form of the in di vid ual soul. The pur pose or aim of the two Sruti
pas sages is to teach about the High est Self or Para Brah man and
show the iden tity of the Jiva and Para Brah man.
As the word Dvau, i.e., two is used in the two Srutis we must
real ise that they re fer to the same Vidya. Though the Mundaka text
says that one bird (the in di vid ual soul) eats the fruits of ac tions and
the other bird looks on with out eat ing and though the lat ter pas sage
re fers to the two as eat ing fruits, the Vidyas are the same as they re fer
to the same en tity. Just as when in a group one car ries an um brella
we say um brella-hold ers go, even so the Para Brah man also is de -
scribed as eat ing fruits. The con text re fers clearly to the eter nal and
Su preme Brah man ( _Aksharam brahma yat param_ ).
The Katha Upanishad text in ti mates the same high est Brah man
which is above all de sires. As it is men tioned to gether with the en joy -
ing in di vid ual soul, it is it self met a phor i cally spo ken of as en joy ing,
just as we speak of the ‘men with the um brella’ al though only one out
of sev eral car ries an um brella. All this has been ex plained at length
un der I.2. 1 1.
There fore, the Vidyas are one only, as the ob ject of med i ta tion
or Knowl edge is one.

CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 403
```

Two pas sages from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad are taken
up for dis cus sion to show that they re late to the same Vidya.
In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Ushasta ques tions
Yajnavalkya, “Ex plain to me the Brah man which is pres ent to in tu i tion,
not hid den—this At man or Self which is within all” (Bri. Up. III.4.1).
Yajnavalkya re plies, “That which breathes through Prana is your self,
that is within all.”
In the same Upanishad Yajnavalkya gives an an swer to the
same ques tion put by Kahola, “That which tran scends hun ger and
thirst, grief and de lu sion, de cay and death, know ing this very self” etc.
(Bri. Up. III.5.1).
The Purvapakshin main tains that these two are sep a rate
Vidyas, be cause the re plies given be ing dif fer ent, the ob jects re ferred
to must also be dif fer ent.
This Su tra re futes this and de clares that the ob ject is one, the
High est Self or Para Brah man, be cause it is im pos si ble to con ceive
two selves be ing si mul ta neously in ner most of all in the same body.
At man alone is taught in the two texts as be ing ul ti mately im ma -
nent just as At man is also taught as be ing im ma nent in the el e ments.
The two pas sages re fer only to one Vidya, be cause there could be
only one At man, who is Sarvantara, i.e., ul ti mately im ma nent. Among
the el e ments wa ter is im ma nent in earth, fire in wa ter and so on. But
none has ul ti mate im ma nency. Even so there is only one ul ti mate im -
ma nent en tity.
Rel a tively one el e ment can be in side the other. But none of the
five el e ments which con sti tute this phys i cal body can be truly the in -
ner most of all. Sim i larly two selves can not be si mul ta neously the in -
ner most of all in the same body. Even so one self alone can be the
in ner most of all.
There fore, the same self is taught in both the re plies of
Yajnavalkya.
In both the cases the sub ject-mat ter of the ques tion and the an -
swer is Brah man. This is emphasised by the sage Yajnavalkya him -
self, when he re peats “That soul of thine is the in ner most soul of
in di vid u als.” The dif fer ent ex po si tions of Yajnavalkya re fer to the one
and the same ob ject of wor ship, viz., Brah man.
As both texts equally de clare the self to be within all, they must
be taken as con sti tut ing one Vidya only. In both pas sages ques tion
and an swer equally re fer to a Self which is within ev ery thing. For in
one body, there can not be two selves, each of which is in side ev ery -
thing else. One Self only may be within ev ery thing. We read in the
Svetasvatara Upanishad “He is the one God, hid den in all be ings,
all-per vad ing, the Self within all be ings.” As this Man tra re cords that
one Self lives within the ag gre gate of all be ings, the same holds good
with re gard to the two pas sages of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 404
```

As the ob ject of Knowl edge or the ob ject of wor ship is one, the
Vidya also is one only.

**AÝ`Wm ^oXmZwnn{Îm[a{V MoÞmonXoemÝVadV²Ÿ&**

**Anyatha bhedanupapattiriti chennopadesantaravat** III.3.36 (395)
If it be said (that the two Vidyas are separate, for) other wise the
repetition cannot be accounted for, we reply not so; (it is) like
(the repetition) in another instruction (in the Chhandogya).

**Anyatha:** otherwise; **Bhedanupapattih:** the repetition cannot be
account ed for, no justification for the variety in the wording of the two
replies; **Iti:** so, this; **Chet:** if; **Na:** no, not so; **Upadesantaravat:** as will
be seen from other teachings, as in the teaching of another Vidya,
mode of meditation, namely the Satya Vidya in the Chhandogya.
( **Bheda:** difference; **Anupapattih:** not obtaining.)

The op po nent says that un less the sep a rate ness of the two
Vidyas be ad mit ted, the sep a ra tion of the two state ments can not be
ac counted for. He re marks that un less the two texts re fer to two dif fer -
ent selves the rep e ti tion of the same sub ject would be mean ing less.
This Su tra says that it is not so. The rep e ti tion has a def i nite pur -
pose or aim. It helps the as pi rant to com pre hend the sub jects more
clearly and deeply from dif fer ent view points. The rep e ti tion does not
jus tify us to take that two dif fer ent selves are taught here. In
Chhandogya Upanishad the in struc tion con veyed in the words “That
is the Self, Thou art That ( _Tat Tvam Asi_ ), O Svetaketu”, is re peated
nine times, and yet the one Vidya is not thereby split into many. Sim i -
larly is this case also.
The in tro duc tory and con clud ing clauses in di cate that all those
pas sages have the same sense. There also the Upakrama (be gin -
ning) is the same. So is the con clu sion (Upasamhara). It says, “Ev ery -
thing else is per ish able. Ev ery thing else is of evil.”
In the ear lier Brahmana, At man is taught as be ing sep a rate from
the body and the senses. In the later Brahmana, At man is taught as
not hav ing hun ger, etc. But the Vidya is the same.
The for mer sec tion de clares the ex is tence of the Su preme Self
which is nei ther cause nor ef fect, while the lat ter qual i fies it as that
which tran scends all the rel a tive at trib utes of the Samsara state, such
as hun ger, thirst and so on. The sec ond an swer tells some thing spe -
cial about the Self.
The two sec tions, there fore, form one Vidya only.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 405
```

There is exchange (of meditation), because the texts

distin guish (two meditations); as in other cases.

**Vyatiharah:** exchange; reciprocity (of meditation); **Visimshanti:** (the

scriptures) explain clearly, distinguish; **Hi:** because, for; **Itaravat:** as

in other cases.

The Aitareya Aranyaka says with ref er ence to the per son in the
sun, “What I am, that He is; what He is, that am I” (Ait. Ar. II.2.4.6).
A doubt arises here whether the med i ta tion is to be of a re cip ro -
cal na ture, a dou ble one by means of ex change, i.e., iden ti fy ing the
wor ship per with the be ing in the sun, and then in versely, iden ti fy ing
the be ing in the sun with the wor ship per; or only in the for mer man ner.
The Purvapakshin main tains that the med i ta tion is to be prac -
tised in the for mer man ner only and not in the re verse way also. He
ar gues that the soul would be ex alted by the for mer med i ta tion and
the Lord be low ered by the lat ter one! There is a mean ing in the first
kind of med i ta tion but the sec ond kind of med i ta tion is mean ing less.
The pres ent Su tra re futes this view and de clares that the med i -
ta tion is to be prac tised in both ways be cause such a state ment would
be purportless. Ex change, or re verse med i ta tion is ex pressly re -
corded in the Sruti for the pur pose of med i ta tion, just as other qual i -
ties of the Self such as its be ing the self of all, Satyasankalpa, etc., are
re corded for the same pur pose. For both texts make the dis tinc tive
dou ble enun ci a tion “I am Thou” and “Thou art I.” Now the dou ble
enun ci a tion has a sense only if a two fold med i ta tion is to be based
upon it; oth er wise it would be de void of mean ing; since one state ment
would be all that is needed.
This will not in any way lower Brah man. Even in that way, only
the unity of the Self is med i tated upon. Brah man who is bodi less can
be adored or med i tated even as hav ing a form. The dou ble state ment
is merely meant to con firm the one ness of the Self. It gives force or
em pha sis to the iden tity.
There fore, a two fold med i ta tion has to be ad mit ted, not a sin gle
one. This con firms the unity of the Self. The dou ble re la tion enounced
in the Sruti text has to be med i tated upon, and is to be trans formed to
other Vidyas also which treat of the same sub ject.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 406
```

**Sa eva:** the same (Satya Vidya); **Hi:** because; **Satyadayah:**

(attributes like) Satya etc.

We read in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad “He who knows this
great, glo ri ous, first born (Be ing) as the Satya Brah man, con quers
these worlds” (V.4.1). Again we read “That which is Satya is that Sun
the be ing who is in that orb and the be ing who is in the right eye... he
de stroys evils” (V.5.3).
Now a doubt arises whether these two Satya Vidyas are one or
dif fer ent.
The Purvapakshin holds that the Vidyas are two; be cause the
text de clares two dif fer ent re sults, one in the ear lier pas sage “He con -
quers these worlds”(V.4.1), the other one later on “He de stroys evil
and leaves it” (V.5.3).
The Su tra de clares that they are one, be cause the sec ond text
re fers to the Satya of the ear lier text, “That which is Satya,” etc.
In re al ity there is only one re sult in both cases. The state ment of
a sec ond re sult merely has the pur pose of glo ri fy ing the new in struc -
tion given about Satya or the True, viz., that its se cret names are
‘Ahar’ and ‘Aham’.
There fore, the con clu sion is that the text re cords only one Vidya
of the True (Satyam), dis tin guished by such and such de tails and that
hence all the qual i ties men tioned such as Truth and so on are to be
com pre hended in one act of med i ta tion.
Some com men ta tors think that the above Su tra re fers not to the
ques tion whether Bri. Up. V.4,1 and V.5.3 form one Vidya or one med -
i ta tion but to the ques tion whether the Brihadaranyaka text about the
per sons in the sun and in the eye and the sim i lar Chhandogya text
(I.6.6), “Now that golden per son who is seen within the sun” etc. con -
sti tute one Vidya or not.
They come to the con clu sion that they con sti tute one Vidya and
that hence truth and the other qual i ties men tioned in the
Brihadaranyaka are to be com bined with the Chhandogya text also.
But this in ter pre ta tion of the Su tra is ob jec tion able, be cause the
Chhandogya Vidya re fers to the Udgitha and is thus con nected with
sac ri fi cial rites. The marks of this as so ci a tion are seen in the be gin -
ning, the mid dle and the end of the Vidya. We read at the be gin ning,
“The Rik is the earth, the Saman is fire”, in the mid dle, “Rik and
Saman are his joints, and there fore he is the Udgitha,” and in the end,
“He who knows this sings as a Saman” (Chh. Up. I.6.1).
In the Brihadaranyaka, on the con trary, there is ver ily, noth ing to
con nect the Vidya with the sac ri fi cial rites. As the sub ject mat ter is dif -
fer ent, the Vidyas are sep a rate and the de tails of the two Vidyas are to
be held sep a rate.

Dahara Vidya of the Chhandogya and the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishads is now dis cussed.
In the Chhandogya Upanishad (VIII.1.1) we read, “There is this
city of Brah man and in it the pal ace, the small lo tus and in it the small
ether; that is the Self.” We read in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
(IV.4.22) “That great un born self who con sists of Knowl edge, who is
sur rounded by the Pranas lies in the ether that is within the heart.”
A doubt here arises whether the two con sti tute one Vidya and
there fore the par tic u lars are to be com bined or not.
The pres ent Su tra de clares that they form one Vidya and the
qual i ties men tioned in each are to be com bined in the other, be cause
many points are com mon in both.
“Wishes and so on,” i.e., “The qual ity of hav ing true wishes and
so on.” The word ‘Kama’ stands for ‘Satyakama’ just as peo ple oc ca -
sion ally say Datta for Devadatta and Bhama for Satyabhama. This
qual ity and the other qual i ties which the Chhandogya at trib utes to the
ether within the heart, have to be com bined with the Brihadaranyaka

Brihadaranyaka such as be ing the ruler of all, have also to be as -
cribed to the Self free from sin, de scribed in the Chhandogya.
The rea son for this is that the two pas sages ex hibit a num ber of
com mon fea tures. Com mon to both is the heart re garded as abode.
Com mon again is the Lord as ob ject of knowl edge or med i ta tion.
Com mon also is the Lord be ing re garded as a bank pre vent ing these
worlds from be ing con founded. And there are sev eral other points
also.
But an ob jec tion is raised. There are also dif fer ences. In the
Chhandogya the at trib utes are as cribed to the ether within the heart,
while in the Brihadaranyaka they are at trib uted to Brah man abid ing in

the ether. This ob jec tion has no force. It can not cer tainly stand. We
have shown un der I.3.14 that the term ether in the Chhandogya des -
ig nates Brah man.
There is, how ever, one dif fer ence be tween the two texts. The
Chhandogya treats of Saguna Brah man while the Brihadaranyaka
treats of Nirguna Brah man or the Su preme Brah man des ti tute of all
qual i ties. Yajnavalkya says to Janaka “For that per son is not at tached
to any thing. That Self is to be de scribed by No, No— _neti, neti_ ” (Bri.
Up. IV.3.14).
But as the qual i fied Brah man is fun da men tally one with the un -
qual i fied Brah man we must con clude that the Su tra teaches the com -
bi na tion of the qual i ties for glo ri fy ing Brah man and not for the pur pose
of de vout med i ta tion or Upasana.

Adaradhikaranam: Topic 26 (Sutras 40-41)
Pranagnihotra need not be observed on days of fast
```
**AmXamXbmon...Ÿ&**

**Adaradalopah** III.3.40 (399)
On account of the respect shown (to the Pranagnihotra by the
Sruti) there can be no omission (of this act) (even when the
eating of food is omitted).

**Adarat:** on account of the respect shown; **Alopah:** there can be no
omission.

This Su tra gives the view of the Purvapakshin or the op po nent.
Be cause there is lov ing em pha sis on Pranagnihotra in Jabala
Sruti, such Pranagnihotra should not be omit ted.
In the Vaisvanara Vidya of the Chhandogya Upanishad, the
wor ship per is asked first be fore he takes his meals to of fer food to
each of the Pranas, say ing “To Prana I of fer this”. The Sruti at ta ches
much im por tance to this Pranagnihotra. The Sruti en joins that food
must be of fered to the Pranas even be fore en ter tain ing guests.
Now the ques tion is whether the Pranagnihotra is to be ob -
served even on days of fast ing.
The Su tra de clares that there should be no omis sion of it even
on days of fast ing, as the Sruti at ta ches much im por tance to it. The
Jabala Sruti says it must be ob served even on days of fast ing by sip -
ping at least a few drops of wa ter.
To this Purvapaksha the next Su tra gives a re ply.

**CnpñWVo@VñVÛMZmV²Ÿ&**

**Upasthite’tastadvachanat** III.3.41 (400)

When eating is taking place (the Pranagnihotra has to be
performed) from that (i.e., the food first eaten), for so (the Sruti)
declares.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 409
```

**Upasthite:** being present, being near, when food is served; **Atah:**
from that, on that account; **Tadvachanat:** for so (the Sruti) declares.

This Su tra re futes the view ex pressed in the last Su tra, and de -
clares that Pranagnihotra, need not be per formed on fast ing days, be -
cause the Sruti ex pressly de clares, “There fore the first food which
co mes is meant for Homa. And he who of fers that first ob la tion should
of fer it to Prana, say ing Svaha” (Chh. Up. 19.1).
The first por tion of the food should be of fered to the Pranas on
those days when it is taken. The Sruti gives im por tance to this only
and not that it should be ob served even on days of fast ing.

Upasanas mentioned in connection with sacrifices

```
**V{ÞYm©aUm{Z`_ñVX²Ñï>o... n¥W½¿`à{V~ÝY... \$b_²Ÿ&**

**Tannirdharananiyamastaddrishteh
prithagghyapratibandhah phalam** III.3.42 (401)

There is no rule about the inviolability of that (i.e., Upasa nas
connected with certain sacrifices) that is seen (from the Sruti
itself); for a separate fruit (belongs to the Upasanas), viz.,
non-obstruction (of the results of the sacrifice).

**Tannirdharananiyamah:** no rule, about the inviolability of that;
**Taddrishtih:** that being seen (from the Sruti); **Prithak:** separate; **Hi:**
because; **Apratibandhah:** non-obstruction; **Phalam:** fruit, reward,
result.

This Su tra states that a med i ta tion or Upasana pre scribed in
con nec tion with a cer e mo nial rite is not com pul sory.
We have the di rec tion to make a cer tain Upasana as an Anga
(el e ment or limit) of Karma (Karmangavabaddhopasti). Is it an in dis -
pens able el e ment? No. If it is per formed there will be greater fruit.
Even if it is not done the Karma will be com plete. This is clear from the
Chhandogya Upanishad.
We now en ter into an en quiry whether cer tain Upasanas men -
tioned with some sac ri fices are part of those sac ri fices and there fore
in sep a ra ble and per ma nently con nected with them.
The pres ent Su tra de clares that Upasanas do not con sti tute a
part of the sac ri fice, be cause there is no rule as to their in sep a ra bil ity.
The Sruti ex pressly de clares that the sac ri fice can be done with or
with out the Upasanas. “The ig no rant man, as well as the wise man
may both en gage in the Udgitha wor ship; both per form the sac ri fice”
(Chh. Up. I.1.10). This shows that the Udgitha wor ship may be per -
formed, the med i ta tion or Upasana part be ing left out. That which is
per formed with med i ta tion, faith and knowl edge be comes all the more
ef fec tive.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 410
```

There is no fixed rule for com pul sory per for mance of Udgitha
med i ta tion and the like in cere moni als, be cause per for mance of the
med i ta tion on ‘OM’ is left op tional to the per former and also be cause
the fruit in each case is quite dis tinct, if the per for mance of the rite is
not in any way ob structed, be cause it is clear that the med i ta tion is
sure to pro duce its own ef fect in de pend ently of the rite but the rite is li -
a ble to in ter rup tion and ob struc tion. If, how ever, the med i ta tion and
the rite be con joined, fruit be comes dou bly ef fec tive.
The Chhandogya Sruti (I.1.10) in di cates that the rite can be
done even with out med i ta tion or Upasana and that to per form the rite
with med i ta tion is to make it more ef fec tive. Hence the Udgitha med i -
ta tion and all oth ers per formed in con nec tion with cer e mo nial rite
(Karmanga Upasana), are not com pul sory and are to be done by
those only who wish to at tain greater fruits.
The orig i nal sac ri fice brings its own re wards but the Upasana in -
creases its re sults. There fore, the Upasana does not con sti tute a part
of the sac ri fice. There fore, it may or may not be done ac cord ing to the
sweet will of the sac ri ficer.
The Upasana pre vents any ob struc tion to the re sults of the sac -
ri fice. This does not make it a part of the cer e mo nial rite. The re wards
of the sac ri fice may be de layed on ac count of the in ter ven tion of an
evil Karma of the sac ri ficer. The Upasana an ni hi lates the ef fect of this
evil deed and has tens the at tain ment of the fruits of the sac ri fice. That
is all. The sac ri fice does not rely upon the Upasana for its re wards.
There fore, the Upasana does not form a part of the sac ri fice and
is, there fore, op tional.

Pradanadhikaranam: Topic 28
Meditations on Vayu and Prana are to be kept separate
notwithstanding the essential oneness of these two
```
**àXmZdXod VXwº$_²Ÿ&**

**Pradanavadeva taduktam** III.3.43 (402)

As in the case of the offerings (Vayu and Prana must be held
apart). This has been explained (in the Purvamimamsa Sutra).

**Pradanavat:** as in the case of the offerings of the ‘Pradana, oblation’;
**Eva:** exactly; **Tat:** that; **Uktam:** has been stated.

The sec tion of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad which be gins
“Voice held, I shall speak” (Bri. Up. I.5.21) de ter mines Prana to be the
best amomg the or gans of the body and Vayu to be the best among
the Devas.
In the Chhandogya Upanishad Vayu is said to be the gen eral
ab sorber of the Devas, “Vayu in deed is the ab sorber” (IV.3.1); Prana
is said to be the gen eral ab sorber of the or gans of the body, “Breath
in deed is the ab sorber” (IV.3.3).

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 411
```

In the Samvarga Vidya of the Chhandogya Upanishad, med i ta -
tion on Prana with ref er ence to the body and on Vayu with ref er ence
to the gods is pre scribed.
Many Sruti texts say that Prana and Vayu are one in es sence.
There fore, the Purvapakshin main tains that the two med i ta tions can
be com bined and that Vayu and Prana are non-sep a rate be cause in
their true na ture they do not dif fer. And as their true na ture does not
dif fer they must not be med i tated upon sep a rately. In some places we
have even a di rect iden ti fi ca tion of the two, “What Prana is that is
Vayu— _Yah pranah sa vayuh_ .”
The pres ent Su tra re futes the above view and de clares that they
are to be kept apart de spite the non-dif fer ence in na ture of Prana and
Vayu, be cause their func tions on ac count of their dif fer ent abodes are
dif fer ent. Al though there may be non-dif fer ence of true na ture, yet
there may be dif fer ence of con di tion giv ing rise to dif fer ence of in -
struc tion, and through the lat ter to dif fer ence of med i ta tion.
The Su tra com pares the case un der dis cus sion to a par al lel one
from the Karmakanda by means of the clause “as in the case of the of -
fer ings”.
As an il lus tra tion we may take Pradhana where Purodasa (ob la -
tions) is given sep a rately to Raja Indra (the Ruler), Adhiraja Indra (the
mon arch or the over-ruler), and Svaraja Indra (the sov er eign or the
self-ruler) ac cord ing to his dif fer ent ca pac i ties, though Indra is es sen -
tially one, though he is one god.
Hence, though the Vidya is one from the Adhyatmic point of
view, there is sep a rate ness from the Adhidaivata point of view. So the
med i ta tions on Prana and Vayu have to be kept apart. This prin ci ple is
es tab lished by Jaimini, in Purva mimamsa (Sankarsha alias Devata
Kanda).

Lingabhuyastvadhikaranam: Topic 29 (Sutras 44-52)
The fires in Agnirahasya of the Brihadaranyaka are not part
of the sacrificial act, but form an independent Vidya
```
**{b“^y`ñËdmÎm{Õ ~br`ñVX{nŸ&**

**Lingabhuyastvat taddhi baliyastadapi** III.3.44 (403)

On account of the majority of indicatory marks (the fires of the
mind, speech, etc., in the Agnirahasya of the Vajasaneyins do
not form part of the sacrifice), for it (the indicatory mark) is
stronger (than the context or the general subject matter). This
also (has been explained in the Purvamimamsa Sutras by
Jaimini).

**Lingabhuyastvat:** because of an abundance of distinguishing
marks; **Tat:** that, the distinguishing mark; **Hi:** because; **Baliyah:** is
stronger; **Tat:** that; **Api:** also.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 412
```

In the Agnirahasya of the Vajasaneyins (Satapatha Brahmana)
cer tain fires named af ter mind, speech, eyes, etc., are men tioned.
A doubt arises whether these form part of the sac ri fice men -
tioned therein or form an in de pend ent Vidya.
The pres ent Su tra de clares that in spite of the _prima fa cie_ view
which arises from the con text, these form a sep a rate Vidya be cause
there are many indicatory marks to show that these fires form an in de -
pend ent Vidya.
The indicatory marks are of greater force than the con text or the
lead ing sub ject mat ter (Prakarana). This has been ex plained in the
Purvamimamsa (III.3.14).
The ref er ence in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad takes a man’s
age to be one hun dred years, i.e., 36,000 days and de scribes each

day’s men tal ity as an Agnichayana or fire sac ri fice. The pas sage oc -
curs in a por tion re lat ing to Karma or cer e mo nial ac tion. If you say that
such a med i ta tion is an Anga or el e ment in the cer e mo nial be cause it
oc curs in a pas sage re lat ing to Karma, we say that the ma jor ity of
indicatory marks is oth er wise, e.g., the Sruti says that such Chayana
goes on even in sleep. A spe cific rea son given in a pas sage has a
greater weight or force than mere con text.

**nyd©{dH$ën... àH$aUmËñ`mV² {H«$`m_mZgdV²Ÿ&**

**Purvavikalpah prakaranat syat kriyamanasavat** III.3.45 (404)
(The fires spoken of in the previous Sutra are) alternative forms
of the one mentioned first, (i.e., the actual sacrificial fire) on
account of the context; (they) ought to be part of the sacrifice
like the imaginary drink or the Manasa-cup.

**Purvavikalpah:** an alternative form of the already mentioned first;
**Prakaranat:** on account of the context, as can be understood from
the subject matter of the chapter; **Syat:** there may be, ought to be;
**Kriyamana savat:** ceremonial act, like the act of meditation, like the
imaginary drink, as in the case of mental operation in the
soma-sacrifice.

An ob jec tion is raised to the pre ced ing Su tra.
The Purvapakshin raises a fresh ob jec tion. On the tenth day of
the Soma sac ri fice a Soma drink is of fered to Prajapati wherein the

earth is re garded as the cup and the sea as the Soma. This is a men -
tal act only, and yet it forms a part of the sac ri fice.
The same then holds good with re gard to the quasi-agnis made
of mind and so on though these fires are men tal, i.e., imag i nary, yet
they form part of the sac ri fice and not an in de pend ent Vidya, be cause
of the con text. They are an al ter nate form of the ac tual fire men tioned
first.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 413
```

You may say that it is only Arthavada and that a mere Arthavada

Karma as is the case in the Dasaratra Karma.

**A{VXoemƒŸ&**

**Atidesascha** III.3.46 (405)

And on account of the extension (of the attributes of the actual

**Atidesat:** on account of the extension (of the attributes of’ the first to
these fires); **Cha:** and.

Ob jec tion to Su tra 44 is con tin ued by pre sent ing an other ar gu -
ment in sup port of Su tra 45.
The Purvapakshin gives an other rea son to sup port his view.
The Sruti in that pas sage as cribes all the at trib utes of the ac tual fire to
these imag i nary fires. There fore, they are part of the sac ri fice.

**{dÚ¡d Vw {ZYm©aUmV²Ÿ&**

**Vidyaiva tu nirdharanat** III.3.47 (406)

But (the fires) rather constitute the Vidya, because (the Sruti)

**Vidya:** Vidya, form of meditation or worship, Knowledge; **Eva:** alone,
indeed; **Tu:** verily, undoubtedly, but; **Nirdharanat:** because the Sruti
asserts it.

Ob jec tions raised in Sutras 45 and 46 are now re futed.
The word ‘Tu’ (but) sets aside the Purvapaksha. It re futes the
op po nent.
The pres ent Su tra de clares that the fires form an in de pen d ent
Vidya, be cause the text as serts that “They are built of knowl edge
(Vidya) only”, and that “By knowl edge they are built for him who thus
knows”.

**Xe©ZmƒŸ&**

**Darsanaccha** III.3.48 (407)

And because (in the text indicatory marks of that are) seen.

**Darsanat:** it being seen in the scriptures, because it is clearly stated

The indicatory marks are those re ferred to in Su tra 44. In fact
the in ter nal in di ca tions show that it is a Vidya and not a Karmanga.

**Srutyadibaliyastvaccha na badhah** III.3.49 (408)

(The view that the Agnis or fires constitute an independent

etc.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 414
```

**Srutyadibaliyastvat:** on account of the greater force of the Sruti etc.;

**Cha:** and; **Na:** no, cannot; **Badhah:** refutation.

Ob jec tions raised in Sutras 45 and 46 are fur ther re futed.
There is no ne ga tion of this view on the ba sis of the con text, be -
cause of the greater strength of Sruti, etc.
Our op po nent has no right to de ter mine on the ground of
Prakarana that the Agnis are sub or di nate to the sac ri fi cial ac tion and
so to set aside our view ac cord ing to which they are in de pend ent. For
we know from the Purvamimamsa that di rect enun ci a tion (Sruti),
indicatory mark (Lin ga) and syn tac ti cal con nec tion (Vakya) are of
greater force than lead ing sub ject mat ter (Prakarana) and all those
three means of proof are seen to con firm our view of the Agnis be ing
in de pend ent.
Mere con text is of no force against ex press Sruti, Lin ga, etc. The
Sruti used the word ‘Eva’ where there is an im per a tive tense, etc.,
used, a mere Upadesa can be treated as an Arthavada, be cause
there is also an ex press com mand. Where there is no such in di ca tion,
an Upadesa must be treated as a Vidhi. There fore what we have here
is an in de pend ent Vidya and not a Karmanga.
The Sruti di rectly says, “All these fires are kin dled with knowl -
edge alone. The indicatory mark is this.” All be ings kin dle these fires
for him, even when he is asleep. This con ti nu ity of the fire shows that
they are men tal ones. An ac tual sac ri fice is not con tin ued dur ing
sleep. The syn tac ti cal con nec tions “Through med i ta tion alone these
fires of the wor ship per are kin dled.” These three are more forc ible
than mere con text.

On account of the connection and so on (the fires built of mind,

Vidyas (like Sandilya Vidya) are separate; and it is seen (that in

This Su tra gives ad di tional rea sons in sup port of the view set
forth in Su tra 47.
In de pend ence has, against the gen eral sub ject mat ter, to be as -
sumed for the fire-al tars built of mind and so on, be cause the text con -

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 415
```

nects the con stit u ent mem bers of the sac ri fi cial ac tion with ac tiv i ties
of the mind. The text con nects for the pur pose of Sampad Upasana
(med i ta tions based on re sem blance) parts of a sac ri fice with men tal
ac tiv i ties, e.g., “These fires are started men tally, the al tars are set up
men tally, the cups are taken men tally, the Udgatris are praised men -
tally, the Hotris are re cited men tally, ev ery thing con nected with this
sac ri fice is done men tally.” This is pos si ble only if there is a sharp dif -
fer ence be tween things which re sem ble each other.
The Sruti men tions in re gard to such men tal wor ship all the
great ness of a Karmanga. There fore Atidesa (sim i lar ity) ap plies even
on the foot ing of the con text re fer ring to an in de pend ent Vidya which
is sep a rate from a Karmanga.
The fires con sti tute an in de pend ent Vidya, just as the Sandilya
Vidya, Dahara Vidya, form sep a rate Vidyas, al though men tioned
along with sac ri fi cial acts.
A sim i lar thing is seen in Aveshti be ing done as an in de pend ent
cer e mony in the Rajasuya sac ri fice. It is ob served in the sac ri fi cial
por tion of the Vedas, that though the sac ri fice Aveshti is men tioned
along with the Rajasuya sac ri fice, it is yet con si d ered as an in de pend -

**Na samanyadapyupalabdhermrityuvanna hi

In spite of the resemblance (of the fires to the imaginary drink,
they do) not (constitute part of the sacrificial act) because it is
seen (from the reasons given, and on the ground of Sruti that
they form an independent Vidya) as in the case of death; for the
world does not become (fire, because it resembles fire in some
points).

**Na:** not; **Samanyadapi:** in spite of the resemblance, because of
common ness, on the ground of their resemblance to sacrificial fire;
**Upalabdheh:** for it is seen; **Mrityuvat:** just as in the case of death; **Na
hi lokapattih:** for the world does not become (fire on account of
certain resemblances).

The ar gu ment in ref u ta tion of Sutras 45 and 46 is con tin ued.
Though be ing a men tal act, there is an el e ment of sim i lar ity, it is
not a Karmanga be cause it is stated to have a sep a rate fruit. This is
clear from the il lus tra tions re lat ing to Mrityu and de scrib ing the earth
as fire.
The re sem blance cited by the Purvapakshin has no force. It
can not cer tainly stand be cause on ac count of the rea sons al ready
given, viz., the Sruti, indicatory mark, etc., the fires in ques tion sub -
serve the pur pose of man only, and not the pur pose of some sac ri fi -
cial ac tion.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 416
```

Mere re sem blance can hardly jus tify the con trary view. Any thing
in deed may re sem ble any thing in some point or other; but in spite of
that there re mains the in di vid ual dis sim i lar ity of each thing from all
other things.
The case is anal o gous to that of ‘death’. The re sem blance cited
is like the com mon ep i thet ‘death’ ap plied to fire and the be ing in the
sun. “The be ing in that orb is death in deed” (Sat. Br. X.5.2.3). “Fire in -
deed is death” (Tait. Samh. V.1.10.3). This re sem blance can not make
fire and the be ing in the same one.
Again we have “This world is a fire in deed, O Gautama, the sun
is its fuel” etc., (Chh. Up. V.4.1). Here it does not fol low from the sim i -
lar ity of fuel and so on that the world does not ac tu ally be come fire.
Thus also in our case. Hence from the fact that the Manaschita
Agni (fire) is a men tal act like the Manasagraha which is a Karmanga,
you can not on that ground of such sim i lar ity alone ar gue that it also is
a Karmanga.

And from the subsequent (Brahmana) the fact of the text
(under discussion) being such (i.e., enjoining an independent
Vidya) (is known). But the connection (of the fanciful Agnis or
imaginary fires with the actual fire is) on account of the
abundance (of the attributes of the latter that are imagined in
these fires).

**Parena:** from the subsequent (Brahmana), by the subsequent
expression, by the statements immediately following; **Cha:** and;
**Sabdasya:** of Sruti, of the text, of the word; **Tadvidhyam:** the fact of
being such; **Bhuyastvat:** because of abundance; **Tu:** but;
**Anubandhah:** connection.

In a sub se quent Brahmana we have “By knowl edge they as -
cend there where all wishes are at tained. Those skilled in words do
not go there, nor those who des ti tute of knowl edge do pen ance”. This
verse de pre ci ates mere works and praises Vidya or know l edge. A for -
mer Brahmana also viz., the one be gin ning “Where that orb leads”
(Sat. Br. X.5.2.23) con cludes with a state ment of the fruit of knowl -
edge “Im mor tal be comes he whose self is death” and thereby shows
that works are not the chief thing. Hence we con clude that the in junc -
tion of the Sruti is that the fires con sti tute an in de pend ent Vidya.
The con nec tion of the fires with the ac tual fire is not be cause
they con sti tute part of the sac ri fice but be cause many of the at trib utes
of the real fire are imag ined in the fires of the Vidya, in the Agnis built
of mind. The state ment of the fires built of mind along with the or di -

nary sac ri fi cial fire is due to an abun dance of com mon mat ters with

All this es tab lishes the con clu sion that the fire-al tars built of

Some (maintain the non-existence) of a separate self (besi des

**Eka:** some (maintain the non-existence); **Atmanah:** of a separate
self (besides the body); **Sarire:** in the body; **Bhavat:** because of

In this topic the ex is tence of an At man apart from the body is
taken up for dis cus sion. Un less there is a soul apart from the body
there is no use of the scrip ture teach ing lib er a tion. Nor can there be
any scope for eth i cal com mands which are the means of at tain ment

There must be a soul apart from the body who can en joy the
fruits of the Upasana or Vidyas, oth er wise of what avail is Upasana? If
there is no soul all Upasanas be come use less.
At pres ent we will prove the ex is tence of a soul dif fer ent from the
body in or der to es tab lish thereby the qual i fi ca tion of the self for bond -
age and re lease. For if there were no selves dif fer ent from the body,
there would be no room for in junc tion that have the other world for
their re sult, nor could it be taught of any body that Brah man is his Self.
This Su tra gives the view of the Charvakas or Lokayatikas (ma -
te ri al ists) who deny the ex is tence of an At man dif fer ent from the body.
They say that con scious ness is a mere ma te rial prod uct and that the
body is the soul. They de clare that con scious ness is seen to ex ist
only when there is a body and that it is no where ex pe ri enced in de -
pend ent of the body. There fore con scious ness is only an at trib ute or
qual ity of the body. There is no sep a rate self or soul in this body.
They say man is only a body. Con scious ness is the qual ity of the
body. Con scious ness is like the in tox i cat ing qual ity which arises when
cer tain ma te ri als are mixed in cer tain pro por tions. No sin gle ma te rial
has the in tox i cat ing ef fect.
Al though con scious ness is not ob served in earth, and the other
ex ter nal el e ments, ei ther sin gle or com bined, yet it may ap pear in
them when trans formed into the shape of a body. Con scious ness
springs from them. No soul is found af ter the body dies and that hence

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 418
```

as both are pres ent or ab sent to gether, con scious ness is only an at -
trib ute of the body just as light and heat are at trib utes of fire.
As life, move ments, con scious ness, re mem brances and so on,
which are re garded as qual i ties of the At man by those who main tain
that there is an in de pend ent At man apart from the body, are ob served
only within the bod ies and not out side the bod ies, and as an abode of
those at trib utes dif fer ent from the body can not be proved, it fol lows
that they must be at trib utes of the body only.
There fore, the Self is not dif fer ent from the body.
The next Su tra gives a re ply to this con clu sion of the Charvakas
or Lokayatikas (ma te ri al ists).

**Vyatirekastadbhavabhavitvanna tupalabdhivat** III.3.54 (413)

But not (so); a self or soul separate (from the body does exist),
because (Consciousness) does not exist even when there is the
body (after death), as in the case of cognition or per ceptive
consciousness.

**Vyatirekah:** separation; **Tadbhavabhavitvat:** for (consciousness)
does not exist even when there is the body; **Na:** not (so); **Tu:** but;
**Upalabdhivat:** as in the case of knowledge or cognition.

The state ment in the pre ced ing Su tra is re futed.
The soul is sep a rate be cause even when the body ex ists the
soul goes away. They are sep a rate just as sub ject and ob ject are sep -
a rate.
The view ex pressed by the op po nent in the pre vi ous Su tra is
cer tainly wrong, be cause the Atma-Dharma such as Chaitanya (con -
scious ness), etc., are not found af ter death, though the body ex ists.
Con scious ness can not be an at trib ute of the body, be cause we do not
find con scious ness in a body af ter a per son dies.
This con scious ness is an at trib ute of some thing which is dif fer -
ent from the body and which abides in the body.
The sub ject and the ob ject can not pos si bly be iden ti cal. Fire
can not burn it self. The ac ro bat can not stand upon his own shoul der.
Can form sense form? Can sound hear sound? No. Con scious ness is
eter nal, as it is of the same iden ti cal qual ity al ways. Can you say that
con scious ness is a qual ity of the light, be cause light is nec es sary to
see forms? Even so con scious ness is not a qual ity of the body. More -
over con scious ness func tions in dreams even with out the aid of the
body.
The Charvakas ac cept that the cogniser is dif fer ent from the
thing cog nised. So the experiencer of this body, he who cog nises this
body must be dif fer ent from the body. He who cog nises this body is
the Self.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 419
```

There fore, con scious ness is an at trib ute of this Self, rather its
very es sence of na ture.
As con scious ness con sti tutes the char ac ter of the Self, the Self
must be dis tinct from the body. That con scious ness is per ma nent fol -
lows from the uni for mity of its char ac ter and we, there fore, may con -
clude that the con scious Self is per ma nent also. That con scious ness
is the na ture of the Self, that it is per ma nent, fol lows from the fact that
the Self, al though con nected with a dif fer ent state, re cog nises it self
as the con scious agent a rec og ni tion ex pressed in judg ments such as
“I saw this” and from the fact of re mem brance and so on be ing pos si -
ble.
There fore, the view that the Self is some thing sep a rate from the
body is free from all ob jec tions.

Angavabaddhadhikaranam: Topic 31 (Sutras 55-56)
Upasanas connected with sacrificial acts, i.e.,
Udgitha Upasana are valid for all schools
```
**A“md~ÕmñVw Z emImgw {h à{VdoX_²Ÿ&**

**Angavabaddhastu na sakhasu hi prativedam** III.3.55 (414)

But (the Upasanas or meditations connected with parts) (of
sacrificial acts are) not (restricted) to (particular) Sakhas,
according to the Veda (to which they belong), (but to all its
Sakhas because the same Upasana is described in all).

**Angavabaddhah:** (Upasanas) connected parts (of sacrificial acts);
**Tu:** but; **Na:** not; **Sakhasu:** to (particular) Sakhas; **Hi:** because;
**Prativedam:** in each Veda, according to the Veda.

There is no rule that the Angavabaddha (Karmanga) Upa sana
in each Sruti Sakha is sep a rate and should be con fined to it alone.
The above said in ter ven ing or oc ca sional dis cus sion is over.
Now we pur sue the main theme. In Udgitha, etc., var i ous Karmanga
Upasanas are taught. From this you could not say that each Upasana
in each Sruti Sakha is dif fer ent, on ac count of the prox im ity of text and
the dif fer ence in Svaras or sounds. All such Upasanas may be taken
to gether, be cause the Udgitha Sruti is more pow er ful than mere prox -
im ity of con text or di ver sity of Svara.
There are cer tain Upasanas men tioned in con nec tion with sac ri -
fi cial acts, as for ex am ple the med i ta tion on ‘OM’ which is con nected
with the Udgitha as Prana, or the med i ta tion on the Udgitha as the
earth and so on. “Let a man med i tate on the syl la ble ‘OM’ as the
Udgitha” (Chh. Up. I.1.1). “Let a man med i tate on the five-fold Saman
as the five worlds” (Chh. Up. II.2.1).
A doubt here arises whether the med i ta tions or Vidyas are en -
joined with ref er ence to the Udgitha and so on as be long ing to a cer -
tain Sakha only or as be long ing to all Sakhas. The doubt arises

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 420
```

be cause the Udgitha and so on are chanted dif fer ently in dif fer ent
Sakhas, be cause the ac cents, etc., dif fer. There fore, they may be
con sid ered dif fer ent.
Here the Purvapakshin holds that the Vidyas are en joined only
with ref er ence to the Udgitha and so on which be long to the par tic u lar
Sakha to which the Vidya be longs. Why? Be cause of prox im ity.
The pres ent Su tra re futes the view that they are so re stricted,
be cause the text speaks of these Upasanas in gen eral and so they
are all one in all the branches.
The word ‘tu’ (but) dis cards the prima fa cie view or the view of
the Purvapakshin. The Upasanas are not re stricted to their own
Sakhas ac cord ing to the Veda to which they be long but are valid for all
Sakhas, be cause the di rect state ments of the text about the Udgitha
and so on enounce no spec i fi ca tion. Di rect state ment has greater
force or weight than prox im ity.
There is no rea son why the Vidya should not be of gen eral ref er -
ence. We, there fore, con clude that, al though the Sakhas dif fer as to
ac cents and the like, the Vidyas men tioned re fer to the Udgitha and
so on be long ing to all Sakhas, be cause the text speaks only of the
Udgitha and so on in gen eral.

**_ÝÌm{XdÛm{damoY...Ÿ&**

**Mantradivadvavirodhah** III.3.56 (415)
Or else, there is no contradiction (here), as in the case of
Mantras and the like.

**Mantradivat:** like Mantras, etc.; **Va:** or else; **Avirodhah:** there is no
contradiction.

The dis cus sion com menced in Su tra 33 is con tin ued.
Just as Mantras, etc., men tioned in only one Sakha, are used in
an other Sakha, with re spect to that par tic u lar rite, so also the
Upasanas con nected with par tic u lar rites in one Sakha of the Veda
can be ap plied to the other Sakhas.
As for ex am ple the Man tra “Kutarurasi” (thou art the grind ing
stone), pre scribed in one Branch of the Vedas for tak ing stone to grind
rice, is ac cept able in that rite ev ery where; even so the Upasana
(med i ta tion) pre scribed in one Branch of the Vedas may be trans -
ferred or ap plied to other Sakhas or Branches with out ap pre hend ing
any im pro pri ety.
We find that Man tra and Guna and Karma in one Sakha are
taken into an other Sakha, just as the mem bers of sac ri fi cial ac tions
on which cer tain Vidyas rest are valid ev ery where, so the Vidyas
them selves also which rest on those mem bers are valid for all Sakhas
and Vedas.

Bhumajyayastvadhikaranam: Topic 32
Vaisvanara Upasana is one entire Upasana
```
**^yåZ... H«$VwdÁÁ`m`ñËd§ VWm {h Xe©`{VŸ&**

**Bhumnah kratuvajjyayastvam tatha hi darsayati** III.3.57 (416)

Importance (is given to the meditation) on the entire form (of

Vaisvanara) as in the case of sacrifice; for thus (the Sruti)

shows.

**Bhumnah:** on the entire form; **Kratuvat:** as in the case of sacrifice;
**Jyayastvam:** prominence, pre-eminence, importance; **Tatha:** so; **Hi:**
be cause, for, as; **Darsayati:** (the Sruti) shows.

The Vaisvanara Vidya is dis cussed here.
In the Chhandogya Upanishad (V.11.8) there is the Vaisvanara
Vidya, the med i ta tion on the cos mic form of the Lord. The meditator
should think that His head is the heaven, His eye the sun and so on.
Dif fer ent fruits are men tioned for each part of the Upasana. For ex am -
ple, the fruit of med i tat ing on His head as the heaven is “He eats food,
be holds his be loved ones and has Ve dic glory in his house” (Chh. Up.
V.12.2).
Now a doubt arises whether the Sruti here speaks of one
Upasana on the en tire cos mic form or Upasana of each part of
Vaisvanara.
The pres ent Su tra says that the Sruti speaks of one Upasana on
the whole form of Vaisvanara or the cos mic form of the Lord.
The Sruti gives su pe ri or ity to the med i ta tion on Vaisvanara as a
whole, as in the case of Kratu or sac ri fice. Though the Sruti de clares
fruits for Upasana or wor ship of each part of Vaisvanara, yet it
emphasises the wor ship of the en tire Vaisvanara with the uni verse as
His body, just as in sac ri fices like Darsa-Purnamasa all the Angas
have to be com bined.
The sep a rate fruits men tioned for med i ta tion on parts of
Vaisvanara must be com bined into one whole with med i ta tion.
The text informs us that six Rishis, Prakinasala, Uddalaka, etc.,
be ing un able to reach a firm foun da tion in the Knowl edge of
Vaisvanara, went to the King Asvapati Kaikeya; goes on to men tion
the ob ject of each Rishi’s med i ta tion, viz., the sky and so on; de ter -
mines that the sky and so on are only the head and so on of
Vaisvanara. Asvapati said “That is but the head of the self,” and re -
jects all med i ta tions on Vaisva nara in his par tial form. He said “Your
head would have fallen if you had not come to me” (Chh. Up. V.12.2).
As this text dis cour ages par tial wor ship of Vaisvanara, it is quite clear
that it rec om mends the en tire Upasana on the whole Vaisvanara.
More over the sec tion be gins thus: “which is our own self, which
is Brah man” (Chh. Up. V.11.1). This in di cates that the en tire Brah man

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 422
```

is the ob ject of med i ta tion. It ends thus “of that Vaisvanara Self
Sutejas is the head” etc. (Chh. Up. V.18.2). This clearly in ti mates that
only the en tire Upasana is in tended.
For all these rea sons, the view ac cord ing to which the text en -
joins a med i ta tion on the en tire Vaisvanara only is cor rect.

```
Sabdadibhedadhikaranam: Topic 33
Various Vidyas like the Sandilya Vidya, Dahara Vidya and so on are
to be kept separate and not combined into one entire Upasana
```
**ZmZm eãXm{X^oXmV²Ÿ&**

**Nana sabdadibhedat** III.3.58 (417)
(The Vidyas are) separate, on account of the difference of words
and the like.

**Nana:** different, various; **Sabdadibhedat:** on account of difference of
names of words, etc. ( **Bhedat:** due to variety.)

In the pre vi ous Su tra we have ar rived at the con clu sion that a
med i ta tion on Vaisvanara as a whole is the pre-em i nent mean ing of
the text, al though spe cial fruits are stated for med i ta tions on parts
such as Sutejas and so on.
The Purvapakshin fol lows this line of ar gu ment and says that we
must com bine all the dif fer ent Vidyas like Sandilya Vidya, Dahara
Vidya, Satya Vidya, and so on into one com pos ite med i ta tion or more
gen eral med i ta tion on the Lord, as the ob ject of med i ta tion is the one
Lord.
The pres ent Su tra re futes this and de clares that the Vidyas are
sep a rate, al though the ob ject of med i ta tion is on the one Lord, on ac -
count of the dif fer ence of words and the like. For the text ex hib its a dif -
fer ence of words such as “He knows.”
“Let him med i tate”, “Let him form the idea” (Chh. Up. III.14.1).
This dif fer ence of terms is ac knowl edged as a rea son or test of dif fer -
ence of acts, ac cord ing to Purva mimamsa Sutras, II.2.1.
“And the like” or “etc.” re fers to other rea sons like the dif fer ence
in qual i ties.
The Lord in deed is the only ob ject of med i ta tion, but ac cord ing
to its gen eral pur port each pas sage teaches dif fer ent qual i ties of the
Lord. Al though one and the same Prana is the ob ject of med i ta tion in
the other se ries of pas sages, yet one of his qual i ties has to be med i -
tated upon in one place and an other in an other place. From dif fer ence
of con nec tion there thus fol lows dif fer ence of in junc tion and from the
lat ter we ap pre hend the sep a rate ness of the Vidyas.
Though the ob ject of med i ta tion is the one Lord, yet He is dif fer -
ent on ac count of the dif fer ence in qual i ties that are imag ined in dif fer -
ent Upasanas. Fur ther it is not pos si ble at all to com bine all the
var i ous Vidyas into one.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 3 423
```

There fore, the dif fer ent Vidyas are to be kept sep a rate and not
com bined into one com pos ite or gen eral med i ta tion.
Though the Vidya (what is to be known) is one, each Upasana
which is de scribed by such words as Upasita, etc., is dif fer ent. In each
Upasana cer tain spe cial at trib utes of the Lord and cer tain spe cial re -
sults are stated.
The forms of med i ta tion such as the Sandilya Vidya, the Satya
Vidya, the Dahara Vidya, the Vaisvanara Vidya, are dif fer ent ow ing to
dif fer ence of names and pro cesses, the di rec tory words and the at -
trib utes, yet, each of them teaches the wor ship of the same Lord; but
un der a par tic u lar as pect med i ta tions have been pre scribed in var i -
ous names and forms so as to suit dif fer ent meditators.
The Su tra, there fore, rightly de clares the sep a rate ness of the
Vidyas.

**{dH$ënmo@{d{eï>\$bËdmV²Ÿ&**

The most im por tant Vidyas are: Sandilya Vidya, Bhuma Vidya,
Sat Vidya, Dahara Vidya, Upakosala Vidya, Vaisva nara Vidya,
Udgitha Vidya, Anandamaya Vidya, Akshara Vidya.
One may fol low any Vidya ac cord ing to his op tion, and stick to it
till he reaches the goal, as the re sult of all Vidyas or the goal is the
same, namely the reali sa tion of Self or Brah man. If we adopt many,
the mind will get dis tracted and the spir i tual prog ress will be re tarded.
When the Brah man is real ised through one med i ta tion, a sec ond
med i ta tion would be pur pose less.
There fore, one must se lect one par tic u lar Vidya and stick to it
and re main in tent on it till the fruit of the Vidya is at tained through the
in tu ition of the ob ject of med i ta tion.

But Vidyas for particular desires may be combined or not

according to one’s desires on account of the absence of the

previous reason (mentioned in the previous Sutra).

**Kamyah:** Vidyas adopted for some sensuous desires; **Tu:** but;
**Yatha kamam:** according to one’s desire or liking; **Samucchiyeran:**
may be combin ed; **Na:** not; **Va:** or; **Purva:** the former; **Hetu:** reason;
Abhavat: on account of the absence of.

This Su tra shows an ex cep tion to the pre vi ous Su tra that more
Vidyas than one may be com bined where the ob ject is other than the
reali sa tion of Brah man.
In the pre vi ous Su tra it was stated that any one of the Vidyas
about Brah man should be taken up, and that more than one at a time
should not be taken up, be cause each Vidya was quite suf fi cient to
take to the goal or Self-reali sa tion and more than one Vidya would
pro duce dis trac tion of the mind.
We have on the other hand, Vidyas con nected with par ti c u lar
de sires, e.g., “He who knows that the wind is the child of the re gions
never weeps for his sons” (Chh. Up. III.15.2). “He who med i tates on
name as Brah man, walks at will as far as name reaches” (Chh. Up.
VII.1.5).
The ques tion arises whether one is to re strict one self to only
one of these Vidyas or can take up more than one at a time.
The pres ent Su tra de clares that one can prac tise more than one
Vidya or not ac cord ing to one’s lik ing, as the re sults are dif fer ent un -
like that of the Brahma-Vidyas. He may prac tise more than one Vidya
or not, on ac count of the ab sence of the for mer rea son, i.e., be cause

Just as the Stotras, etc., are com bined when per form ing Kar -

Such com bi na tion is seen when the Udgatri per forms the Hautra
Karma de scribed in an other Veda for re mov ing the ef fects of er ror in
the dis charge of his func tion.
Chhandogya Upanishad de clares “What is Udgitha is OM or

of the Udgitha and OM mends the Udgitha de filed by any mis take
com mit ted even on the part of the Hotri, the hymn-re cit ing priest in
rec i ta tion of the Udgitha” (Chh. Up. I.5.5).
Here it is said that the mis takes com mit ted by the Udgatri or
chant ing priest of the Sama Veda are rec ti fied by the rec i ta tion of the
Hotri or in vok ing priest of the Rigveda. This in di cates that though the
med i ta tions are given in the dif fer ent Vedas they are yet inter linked.
Hence all of them have to be ob served.
The pas sage “From the seat of the Hotri, he sets right any mis -
take com mit ted in the Udgitha” (Chh. Up. I.5.5), de clares that ow ing to
the force of the med i ta tion on the unity of Pranava and Udgitha, the
Hotri rec ti fies any mis take he may com mit in his work, by means of
the work of the Hotri.
Now, as a med i ta tion men tioned in one Veda is con nected with
what is men tioned in an other Veda, in the same man ner as a thing
men tioned in an other Veda, the above pas sage sug gests the con clu -
sion that all med i ta tions on mem bers of sac ri fi cial acts, in what ever
Veda they may be men tioned—have to be com bined.
A thing be long ing to the Rigveda, viz., Pranava is, ac cord ing to
the Chhandogya text, con nected with the Sama Veda med i ta tion on
the Udgitha. Hence med i ta tions also which be long to dif fer ent Vedas
may be com bined; be cause there is no dif fer ence be tween them and

An other ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 61 is ad duced.
Fur ther Pranava (Omkara) is com mon to all the Upasanas and

It is found in Sruti that OM is the com mon prop erty of all the
Vedas. There fore, it is an in sep a ra ble con com i tant of the sac ri fi cial
rites, pre scribed in the Vedas. Hence the Vidyas also, be ing de pend -
ent on OM, are concomitants of the sac ri fi cial rites. Chhandogya
Upanishad de clares “Through this (‘OM’) the Ve dic Vidya pro ceeds.
With OM the Adhvaryu gives or ders, with OM the Hotri re cites, with
OM the Udgatri sings” (Chh. Up. I.1.9). This is stated with re f er ence to
OM, which is com mon to all the Vedas and all the Upasanas in them.
This in di cates that as the abode of all Vidyas, viz., OM, is com mon, so

There is no bind ing rule that the Vidyas, de pend ing on the
Pranava or on any part of a sac ri fi cial rite, is a nec es sary con com i tant
of the sac ri fice. It may be dis pensed with or re tained at the op tion of
the per former. But there is this dif fer ence. If Vidyas be as so ci ated with
the rites greater good will ac crue.
Though the ut ter ance of the Pranava or the Udgitha hymn has
been en joined by the Sruti to be nec es sary for the sac ri fi cial per for -
mance, yet Sruti does not in sist that the Vidya (med i ta tion) por tion of
the per for mance is a nec es sary ad junct to the mind. It is not ab so -
lutely nec es sary for the ful fil ment of ex ter nal sac ri fices. A sac ri fice
may be per formed even with out the Vidya (med i ta tion) merely by ut -
ter ance of Mantras, sing ing of the Udgitha hymns, pour ing of the clar i -
fied but ter into the sa cred fire and the like ex ter nal rites, in or der to
at tain par tic u lar de sired ob jects, but the Vidya or med i ta tion on Brah -
man leads to reali sa tion of Brah man.
The rule for com bin ing the in struc tions re gard ing sac ri fices that
are scat tered in all the Vedas can not be ap plied with re gard to the
med i ta tions (Upasanas) con nected with them. If the in struc tions re -
gard ing the sac ri fices are not com bined, the sac ri fice will it self fail. But
it is not the case if the Upasanas are not prac tised, be cause
Upasanas only in crease the fruits of the sac ri fice (Vide III.3.42).
Upasanas are not in sep a ra ble from the sac ri fice.
There fore, Upasanas (Vidyas, med i ta tions) may or may not be
prac tised.

**Darsanaccha** III.3.66 (425)

And because the Sruti (scripture) says so (shows it).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 428
```

**Darsanat:** because the Sruti says so, shows it from Sruti; **Cha:** and,
also.

This Su tra is ad duced in sup port of Su tra 65.
This may also be in ferred from Sruti.
Chhandogya Upanishad de clares “The Brahmana (su per in -
tend ing chief priest) who pos sesses such knowl edge saves the sac ri -
fice, the sac ri ficer and all the priests, just as the horse saves the
horse man” (Chh. Up. IV.17.10).
This shows that the scrip tures do not in tend that all the med i ta -
tions should go to gether. For, if all med i ta tions were to be com bined,
all priests would know them all and the text could not spe cially an -
nounce that the Brahmana, chief su per in tend ing priest, pos sess ing a
cer tain knowl edge thereby saves the oth ers.
The med i ta tions, there fore, ac cord ing to one’s lik ing may or may
not be com bined.

INTRODUCTION
```
In the last Sec tion the Vidyas or Upasanas (med i ta tions) which
are the means to the knowl edge of Brah man were dis cussed.
In this Sec tion the Sutrakara en ters into an en quiry whether the
knowl edge of Brah man is con nected with rit u al is tic work through one
who is en ti tled to per form the works or is an in de pend ent means to
ac com plish the pur pose of man.
Sri Baadarayana, the Sutrakara, be gins by stat ing the fi nal view
in the first Su tra, “Thence” etc. He is of opin ion that through the in de -
pend ent Knowl edge of Brah man en joined in the Vedanta-texts the
pur pose of man is ef fected.
In the pres ent Sec tion it will be shown that Knowl edge of Brah -
man is in de pend ent of Karma and that is not sub or di nate to sac ri fi cial
acts.
Baadarayana es tab lishes that the at tain ment of the fi nal eman -
ci pa tion is the di rect re sult of Brahma Vidya of knowl edge of Brah -
man, that works or sac ri fices are only in di rect aids to con tem plat ing
by pu ri fy ing the heart, that Karma does not di rectly lead to the fi nal be -
at i tude, that the seeker of Brah man may even do away with Karma
and may at tain free dom solely by con tem pla tion on Brah man and that
even in that case he should not aban don the du ties en joined by the
scrip tures.

**SYNOPSIS**
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-17) proves that the knowl edge of Brah -
man is not Kratvartha, i.e., sub or di nate to ac tion (sac ri fi cial acts) but
in de pend ent.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Sutras 18-20) con firms this con clu sion that
Sannyasa is pre scribed by the scrip tures, that the state of the
Pravrajins is en joined by the sa cred law and that for them Brahma
Vidya only is pre scribed, and not ac tion.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 21-22) de ter mines that cer tain clauses
form ing part of Vidyas are not mere glorificatory pas sages (Srutis or
Arthavadas) but them selves en join the med i ta tion.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Sutras 23-24) The sto ries re corded in the
Upanishads are not to be used as sub or di nate mem bers of acts. They
do not serve the pur pose of Pariplavas and do not form part of the rit u -
al is tic acts. They are meant to glo rify the Vidya taught in them. They
have the pur pose of glo ri fy ing as Arthavadas the in junc tions with
which they are con nected.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Su tra 25) For all these rea sons the Sannya sin
need not ob serve rit u al is tic acts as knowl edge serves their pur pose.
They re quire no ac tions but only knowl edge.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 26-27) Nev er the less the ac tions en -
joined by scrip ture such as sac ri fices, con duct of cer tain kinds, etc.,
are use ful as they are in di rect means of knowl edge.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 28-31) Cer tain re lax ations al lowed by
scrip ture of the laws re gard ing food, are meant only for cases of ex -
treme need. Re stric tions as re gards food may be aban doned only
when life is in dan ger.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Sutras 32-35) The du ties of the Asramas are
to be per formed by even one who does not strive af ter lib er a tion or
who is not de sir ous of knowl edge.
_Adhikarana IX:_ (Sutras 36-39) Those who stand mid way be -
tween two Asramas are also en ti tled to knowl edge. Those also who
ow ing to pov erty and so on, are Anasramins, have claims to Vidya.
_Adhikarana X:_ (Su tra 40) A Sannyasi who has taken the vow of
life-long cel i bacy can not re voke his vow. He can not re vert back to his
for mer stages of life.
_Adhikarana XI:_ (Sutras 41-42) Ex pi a tion of the fall of an
Urdhvareta, of one who trans gresses the vow of life-long cel i bacy.
_Adhikarana XII:_ (Su tra 43) Ex clu sion of the fallen Urdhva retas
or life-long cel i bate. He must be shunned by So ci ety.

```

```

_Adhikarana XIII:_ (Sutras 44-46) Those med i ta tions which are
con nected with sub or di nate mem bers of the sac ri fice are the busi -
ness of the priest, not of the Yajamana or sac ri ficer.
_Adhikarana XIV:_ (Sutras 47-49) Bri. Up. III.5.1 en joins Mauna or
med i ta tion as a third in ad di tion to Balya (child-like state) and
Panditya (schol ar ship or er u di tion).
_Adhikarana XV:_ (Su tra 50) By Balya or child-like state is to be
un der stood a child-like in no cent state of mind, be ing free from pas -
sion, an ger, etc.
_Adhikarana XVI:_ (Su tra 51) in ti mates that the fru ition of knowl -
edge may take place even in this life if there be no ob struc tion to it (the
means adopted).
_Adhikarana XVII:_ (Su tra 52) de clares that there is no dif fe r ence
in lib er a tion, i.e., in the reali sa tion of Brah man. It is of one kind in all
cases.

Purusharthadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutra 1-17)
Knowledge of Brahman is independent of sacrificial acts

**Purushartho’tah sabdaditi baadarayanah** III.4.1 ( 426 )

From this (Brahma Vidya or Brahma Jnana results) the

purpose or the chief object of pursuit of man, because the

scriptures state so; thus (holds) the sage Baadarayana.

**Purusharthah:** purpose of man, object of human pursuit, here the

chief object, i.e., salvation; **Atah:** from this, from Brahma Vidya;

**Sabdat:** from the scriptures, because the scriptures state so, from

Sruti; Iti: so thus (says), this is the opinion of; **Baadarayanah:** the

sage Baadarayana, (holds).

The re sult or fruit of Brahma Vidya is stated.
The Sutrakara Sri Vyasa now pro ceeds to show that Brahma
Jnana leads not to Karma, but to the at tain ment of the high est
Purushartha, i.e., Moksha or the fi nal eman ci pa tion. That is
Baadarayana’s teach ing.

The four Purusharthas are: Dharma (dis charge of re li gious
duty), Artha (ac qui si tion of wealth, worldly pros per ity), Kama (en joy -
ment), and Moksha (sal va tion). Knowl edge of Brah man is not merely
con nected with sac ri fi cial acts by af ford ing to the agent a cer tain qual -
i fi ca tion. It def i nitely paves the way for the at tain ment of the fi nal re -
lease or free dom from births and deaths.
Whence is this known? From the scrip ture.
Baadarayana bases his ar gu ments on the Sruti texts, such as
“The knower of At man goes be yond grief— _Tarati sokamatmavit_ ”
(Chh. Up. III.4.1). “He who knows the high est Brah man be comes
even Brah man— _Brahmavit brahmaiva bhavati_ ” (Mun. Up. III.2.9).
“He who knows Brah man at tains the High est— _Brahmavidapnoti
Param_ ” (Tait. Up. II.1).

“For him who has a teacher there is de lay only so long as he is
not de liv ered; then he will be per fect” (Chh. Up. VI.14.2). “He who has
searched out and un der stood the Self which is free from sin, etc., ob -
tains all worlds and all de sires” (Chh. Up. VIII.7.1). “The At man is to
be seen” etc., up to “Thus far goes im mor tal ity” (Bri. Up. IV.5.6-15).
These and sim i lar texts em phat i cally de clare that Knowl edge of
Brah man ef fects the high est pur pose of man or Su preme
Purushartha.

Against this the Purvapakshin raises his ob jec tion as fol lows.
Here Jaimini co mes for ward with his fol low ing ob jec tions.

**eofËdmËnwéfmW©dmXmo `WmÝ`opîd{V O¡{_{Z...Ÿ&**

**Seshatvatpurusharthavado yathanyeshviti jaiminih** III.4.2 ( 427 )

Because (the self) is supplementary (to sacrificial acts), (the
fruits of the Knowledge of the Self) are mere praise of the agent,
as in other cases; thus Jaimini opines.

**Seshatvat:** because of being supplementary (to sacrificial acts);
**Pusushar thavadah:** are mere praise or the agent; **Yatha:** as;
**Anyeshu:** in other cases; **Iti:** thus (says); **Jaiminih:** Jaimini (holds).

Sutras 2 to 7 are Purvapaksha Sutras and Sutras 8 to 17 are
Siddhanta Sutras.
Jaimini thinks that the Sruti texts merely praise the doer of
Karma and that Brahmajnana is only an ac ces sory of Karma
(Karmanga).
He is of the opin ion that the Vedas merely pre scribe works to at -
tain cer tain pur poses in clud ing eman ci pa tion. He holds that the
knowl edge of Brah man has no in de pend ent fruit of its own be cause it
stands in a sub or di nate re la tion to sac ri fi cial ac tion. This re la tion is
med i tated by the Self, the ob ject of knowl edge, which is the agent in
all works and, there fore, it self stands in a sub or di nate re la tion to ac -
tion. The agent be comes qual i fied for ac tions, the fruit of which will
only ap pear af ter death by know ing that his self will sur vive the body.
A man un der takes a sac ri fi cial act only when he is con scious
that he is dif fer ent from the body and that af ter death he will go to
heaven when he will en joy the fruits of his sac ri fice.
The qual i fi ca tion the self thus ac quires is sim i lar to that which
the rice-grains ac quire by be ing sprin kled with wa ter; be cause they
be come fit to be used in the sac ri fice, only through this lat ter act of
cer e mo nial pu ri fi ca tion.
As the knowl edge of the Self has no in de pend ent po si tion, it
can not have an in de pend ent fruit of its own. There fore the pas sages
which state such fruits can not be taken as in junc tions of fruits, but
merely as Arthavadas (or glorificatory pas sages), like other
Arthavadas re lat ing to the sub stance (Dravya) or to the pu ri fi ca tion of
the sub stance (Samskara) or to sub or di nate acts them selves
(Karma), mak ing some ad di tional state ment about the fruits of the
sac ri fi cial ac tions to which the knowl edge of the Self is aux il iary.
Jaimini main tains that the state ment that the re ward of Brahma
Jnana is the high est good does not mean that such knowl edge of the
Self by it self yields any real fruit but the state ment is only an ex hor ta -
tion to the per for mance of the sac ri fices. He says that the knowl edge
of the self is use ful only so far as it pro duces in the per former a be lief
in his ex tra-mun dane ex is tence to en able him to en joy the re wards of
his sac ri fices. The state ment that it yields any fruit by it self is only an
ex hor ta tion to pu ri fi ca tion of the sac ri ficer. The pu ri fi ca tion of the sac -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 434
```

ri ficer is a nec es sary con com i tant fac tor like other ma te rial req ui sites
of a sac ri fice; be cause with out this pu ri fi ca tion he would not be as -

sured of his sur viv ing the body and en joy ing the fruit of his sac ri fices
in a higher world af ter death.

**AmMmaXe©ZmV²Ÿ&**

**Acharadarsanat** III.4.3 ( 428 )
Because we find (from the scriptures such) conduct (of men of
realisation).

**Acharadarsanat:** because of the conduct found (from the
scriptures).

```
The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 2 is strength ened.
Janaka the king of the Videhas per formed a sac ri fice in which
```
gifts were freely dis trib uted (Bri. Up. III.1.1). “Sirs, I am go ing to per -
form a sac ri fice” (Chh. Up. V.11.5). These and sim i lar pas sages in di -

cate that those who know Brah man are con nected with sac ri fi cial
ac tion.
Janaka and Asvapati were knowers of Brah man. If they had at -

tained the fi nal eman ci pa tion by knowl edge of Brah man there was no
ne ces sity for them to per form sac ri fices. If mere knowl edge could ef -

fect the pur pose of man, why should they per form sac ri fices trou ble -
some in many re spects? If a man would find honey in the Arka tree
why should he go to the for est? But the two texts in ti mate that they did

per form sac ri fices.
This proves that one at tains the fi nal eman ci pa tion through sac -
ri fices or works alone and not through the knowl edge of Brah man, as

the Vedantins main tain.

**VÀN®>Vo...**

**Tacchruteh** III.4.4 ( 429 )

Because scripture directly declares that (viz., that knowledge
of Brahman stands in a subordinate relation to sacrificial
acts.)

**Tat:** that, that knowledge is subsidiary and supplementary to
sacrifice; **Sruteh:** from Sruti, because the scriptures directly declare.

The Sruti also says that Vidya is an Anga of Karma.
If one does Karma with knowl edge there will be greater ef fi -
ciency. “What a man does with knowl edge, faith and med i ta tion is

more pow er ful” (Chh. Up. I.1.10). This text clearly in di cates that
knowl edge is a part of the sac ri fi cial act. This pas sage di rectly states

that knowl edge is sub or di nate to work and from this it fol lows that
mere knowl edge can not ef fect the pur pose of man.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 435
```

**g_Ýdmaå^UmV²Ÿ&**

**Samanvarambhanat** III.4.5 ( 430 )

Because the two (knowledge and work) go together (with the

departing soul to give fruits of actions).

**Samanvarambhanat:** because of the accompanying together, as
they jointly follow the sacrificer to produce their effects on account of
their taking hold together or being together.

The ob jec tion be gun in Su tra 2 is con tin ued.
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (IV.4.2) says “The de part ing soul is
fol lowed by knowl edge and work.” This pas sage in di cates that knowl -
edge and work go to gether with the soul and be gin to gether to man i -
fest their fruits. There fore, it fol lows that knowl edge is not
in de pend ent. It is not able to pro duce any such ef fect in de pend ently.
It is con cluded that knowl edge is not in de pend ent of works or sac ri fi -
cial acts.

**VÛVmo {dYmZmV²Ÿ&**

**Tadvato vidhanat** III.4.6 ( 431 )

Because (the scriptures) enjoin (works) for such (only who

understand the purport of the Vedas).

**Tadvatah:** for such (as know the purport of the Vedas); **Vidhanat:**
be cause (the scriptures) enjoin (work).

The ob jec tion, be gun in the Su tra 2, is con tin ued.
Fur ther Karma is en joined for one who re cites and stud ies the
Vedas. “He who has learnt i.e., read the Vedas from a fam ily of teach -
ers, ac cord ing to the sa cred in junc tion in the lei sure time left from the
du ties to be per formed for the Guru; who af ter hav ing re ceived his dis -
charge has set tled in his own house, study ing his sa cred texts in
some sa cred spot” (Chh. Up. VIII.15.7). Such pas sages also in di cate
that those who know the pur port of the whole Veda are qual i fied for
sac ri fi cial acts and that hence knowl edge does not in de pend ently
pro duce any re sult.

**{Z`_mƒŸ&**

**Niyamaccha** III.4.7 ( 432 )

And on account of prescribed rules.

**Niyamat:** on account of prescribed rules, because of compulsory
injunction; **Cha:** also, and.

The ar gu ment be gun in Su tra 2 is con cluded here.
Do ing Karma is a Niyama or life-long com mand ment. “Per form -
ing works here (i.e., in this life), let a man wish to live a hun dred years”
(Isa. Up. 2). “Agnihotra is a sac ri fice last ing up to old age and death;
for through old age one is freed from it or through death” (Sat. Br.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 436
```

XII.4.1.1). From such def i nite rules also it fol lows that Knowl edge is
merely sup ple men tary to works, or stands in a sub or di nate re la tion to
work.
The Sutrakara (Sri Vyasa) up holds his view in the fol low ing Su -
tra against all those ob jec tions.

**A{YH$monXoemÎmw ~mXam`Uñ`¡d§ VÔe©ZmV²Ÿ&**

**Adhikopadesaattu baadarayanasyaivam taddarsanat** III.4.8 ( 433 )

But because (the scriptures) teach (the Supreme Self to be)
other (than the agent), Baadarayana’s view is correct (or valid)
for that is seen thus (in scriptural passages).

**Adhikopadesat:** because (the sriptures) teach (the Supreme Self to
be) something over and above; **Tu:** but; **Baadarayanasya:** of
Baadarayana; **Evam:** thus, such (is the opinion); **Taddarsanat:** for
that is seen (from the scrip tures). ( **Adhika:** Supreme Being, more
different; **Upadesat:** from the statement in Sruti, owing to the
teaching about.)

Ob jec tions raised in Sutras 2 to 7 are now be ing re futed one by
one. This Su tra re futes Su tra 2.
Sutras 2-7 give the view of the Mimamsakas which is re futed in
Sutras 8-17.
The Sruti de clares Isvara as higher than the in di vid ual soul. So
Baadarayana’s doc trine as stated in Su tra 1 is cor rect. The Sruti
shows this. The real na ture of the soul is di vin ity.
The word ‘tu’ (but) dis cards the Purvapaksha. The Vedanta texts

do not teach the lim ited self which is the agent. What the Vedanta
texts re ally teach as the ob ject of Knowl edge is some thing dif fer ent
from the em bod ied self, viz., the non-trans mi grat ing Lord who is free
from all at trib utes of trans mi grat ing ex is tence such as agency and the
like and dis tin guished by free dom from sin and so on, the Su preme
Self.
The knowl edge of such a self does not only not pro mote ac tion
but rather puts an end to all ac tions. Hence the view of the re vered
Baadarayana which was stated in Su tra 1 re mains valid and can not
be shaken by fal la cious rea son ing about the sub or di na tion of knowl -
edge to ac tion and the like.
That the Vedanta texts teach the Su preme Self is clear from
such texts as the fol low ing: “He who per ceives all and knows all”
(Mun. Up. I.1.9). “From ter ror of it the wind blows, from ter ror the sun
rises” (Tait. Up. II.8). “It is a great ter ror, a raised thun der bolt” (Katha
Up. II.6.2). “By the com mand of that Im per ish able one, O Gargi” (Bri.
Up. III.8.9). “It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth
fire” (Chh. VI.2.3).

**VwëmÝVw Xe©Z_²Ÿ&**

**Tulyam tu darsanam** III.4.9 ( 434 )

But the declarations of the Sruti equally support both views.

**Tulyam:** the same, similar, equal; **Tu:** but; **Darsanam:** declaration of

the Sruti.

This Su tra re futes the view ex pressed in Su tra 3. It is a re ply to
the third Su tra.
There are equal Srutis which show that Vidya is not Karmanga.
The Sruti shows that Vidya is not Karmanga.
The word ‘tu’ (but) is used in or der to re move the idea that Vidya
is sub or di nate to Karma. There is equal au thor ity in the scrip tures
from the prop o si tion that Vidya is not sub or di nate to Karma, that for
one who has at tained knowl edge there is no work. Thus there are
scrip tural pas sages such as: know ing this the Rishis de scended from
Kavasa said: “For what pur pose should we study the Vedas, for what
pur pose should we sac ri fice? Know ing this in deed the an cient ones
did not of fer the Agnihotra”, and “when Brahmanas know that self and
have risen above the de sire for sons, wealth and worlds, they wan der
about as men di cants” (Bri. Up. III.5).
Thus the sages called Kavaseyas did not care for Karma, nor
did Yajnavalkya, who aban don ing all Kar mas went to for est. “This
much in deed is the means of Im mor tal ity, my dear, say ing this
Yajnavalkya left home” (Bri. Up. IV.5.15). Thus we find ex am ples of
em i nent men de voted to Vidya, re nounc ing all cer e mo nial ac tions.
There fore, scrip tural texts are not all one-sided, in fa vour of Kar mas,
but there are pas sages to the con trary also. The ex am ples of per sons
like Janaka and oth ers in di cate that these men fol lowed Karma as an
ex am ple to man kind, so that the so cial or der may be pre served. Their
work was char ac ter ised by non-at tach ment and there fore it was prac -
ti cally no work at all. Hence the ar gu ment of the Mimamsakas is
weak.
There are in deed found in Srutis in stances of sac ri fices be ing
per formed by en light ened souls like Janaka, but there are also dec la -
ra tions of equal weight to the ef fect that per for mance of sac ri fices is
quite use less and re dun dant for the en light ened, i.e., those who have
known Brah man.
So it can not be as serted on the strength of the in stances of
Janaka and oth ers like him, that knowl edge is to be con sid ered as
sec ond ary to the sac ri fice.
With ref er ence to the indicatory sign as to the de pend ence of
knowl edge to work, which is im plied in the pas sage “Sirs, I am go ing
to per form a sac ri fice” we say, that it be longs to a sec tion which treats
of Vaisvanara.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 438
```

Now the texts may de clare that a Vidya of Brah man as lim it ed by
ad juncts is ac com pa nied by works; but all the same the Vidya does
not stand in a sub or di nate re la tion to works as the lead ing sub ject
mat ter and the other means of proof are ab sent.
The au thor or Sutrakara (Baadarayana) next an swers the ob -
jec tion raised in the Su tra 4.

**Agmd©{ÌH$sŸ&**

**Asarvatriki** III.4.10 (435)

(The scriptural declaration referred to in Sutra 4) is not of
universal application.

**Asarvatriki:** not universal, not applicable everywhere.

The ref u ta tion of the ob jec tions is con tin ued. This Su tra spe -
cially re futes Su tra 4.
The state ment of the Sruti re ferred to in Su tra 4 to the ef fect that
the com bi na tion of med i ta tion and sac ri fice makes the sac ri fice ef fec -
tive is not ap pli ca ble ev ery where. The above-men tioned state ment of
the Sruti does not re fer to med i ta tions in gen eral, but only to the
Udgitha Vidya which forms the sub ject mat ter of the dis course con -
cerned.
The dec la ra tion of the Sruti that Knowl edge in creases the fruit of
the sac ri fice does not re fer to all knowl edge (all Vidyas), as it is con -
nected only with the Udgitha (Udgitha Vidya) which is the topic of the
sec tion “Let a man med i tate on the syl la ble OM as the Udgitha.”
The text says that if this Udgitha Vidya is re cited by a per son
with knowl edge, then it is more fruit ful than if it is re cited with out such
Vidya.
There fore, Vidya is not an aux il iary to work in ev ery in stance.
The au thor next an swers the ob jec tion raised in III.4.5.

**{d^mJ... eVdV²Ÿ&**

**Vibhagah satavat** III.4.11 (436)
There is division of knowledge and work as in the case of a
hundred (divided between two persons).

**Vibhagah:** (there is) division of knowledge and work; **Satavat:** as in
the case of a hundred (divided between two persons).

This Su tra spe cially re futes Su tra 5.
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad de clares “The de part ing soul is fol -
lowed by Vidya (Knowl edge) and Karma (work) and past ex pe ri -
ences” (IV.4.2). Here we have to take knowl edge and work in a

and Karma to other souls. There is no com bi na tion of the two.
The text quoted re fers only to knowl edge and work which con -
cern the soul that trans mi grates but not the soul which is about to ob -
tain fi nal re lease. Be cause the pas sage, “Thus does the man who
de sires to trans mi grate” (Bri. Up. IV.4.6) in di cates that the pre vi ous
text re fers to the soul that trans mi grates. The Sruti de clares of the
soul who is about to be re leased, “But the man who never de sires
never trans mi grates” (Bri. Up. IV.4.6).

**Adhyayanamatravatah:** of one who has merely read the Vedas.

This Su tra spe cially re futes Su tra 6.
He who has read the Vedas and known about the sac ri fices is

knowl edge of Brah man (Brahma Jnana).

**Naviseshat** III.4.13 (438)
There being no specification (the rule does) not (specially apply
to him who knows, i.e., a Jnani).

**Na:** not, compulsion does not apply; **Aviseshat:** on account of the
absence of any specification, because there is no special mention.

This Su tra spe cially re futes Su tra 7.
The Sruti “ _Kurvanneveha_ ” “per form ing works here let a man
live” etc., of the Isavasya Upanishad does not spe cially ap ply to a
Brahma Jnani. It is gen eral in its terms. There is no spe cial men tion in
it that it is ap pli ca ble to a Jnani also. It is not bind ing on a Jnani when
there is no spec i fi ca tion.
The Sruti of the Isavasya does not lay down any such re stric tive
rule that even the il lu mined sage must per form Karma through out his
life. Why so? _Aviseshat_. Be cause there is no spec i fi ca tion. All that it
says is “Let one per form Kar mas through out his life”. There is noth ing
to show to which class of peo ple, that par tic u lar rule is ad dressed. On
the other hand there are ex press texts of the Srutis which show that
im mor tal ity is not to be ob tained by Kar mas, but by knowl edge alone.
Mahanarayana Upanishad of the Tait. Ar. X.5 de clares “Not by
Kar mas (sac ri fices), not by prog eny, nor by wealth can one ob tain im -
mor tal ity. It is by re nun ci a tion alone that some great souled be ings
have ob tained im mor tal ity.”

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 440

The ap par ent con flict in the two Sruti texts is to be rec on ciled by
giv ing them dif fer ent scopes. One is ad dressed to Karma-nishtha
dev o tees, the other to the Jnana-nishtha devotees.

**Stutaye:** for the purpose of glorification (of knowledge); **Anumatih:**
permission; **Va:** or, rather.

This Su tra also re futes Su tra 7.
The pas sage “per form ing works here” may be treated in an other
way also. The in junc tion to do work for the knowers of Brah man or the
il lu mined sages is for eulogising this knowl edge. A Brahma Jnani or
knower of the Self may work all his life but he will not be bound by its
ef fects, on ac count of the power of knowl edge. Knowl edge nul li fies
the ef fect of Karma. “No work clings to the man.” This clearly glo ri fies
Knowl edge.

**Kamakarena chaike** III.4.15 (440)
And some according to their own liking (have abandoned all
works).

**Kamakarena:** according to their own liking; **Cha:** and; **Eke:** some.

The ar gu ment in ref u ta tion of Jaimini’s views is con tin ued.
In Su tra 3 it was stated that Janaka and oth ers per formed sac ri -
fices even af ter at tain ing knowl edge of Brah man. This Su tra says that
some have aban doned all works ac cord ing to their own lik ing. Some
may like to work to set an ex am ple to oth ers af ter at tain ing knowl -
edge, while oth ers may aban don all works. There is no com pul sion on
the knowers of Brah man or lib er ated sages as re gards work.
A scrip tural text of the Vajasaneyins runs as fol lows: “Know ing
this the peo ple of old did not wish for off spring. What shall we do with
off spring, they said, we who have this self and this world” (Bri. Up.
IV.4.22). From this it fol lows that know l edge is not sub or di nate to ac -
tion and that the scrip tural state ments as to the fruit of knowl edge
can not be taken in any but their true sense.

**Upamardam cha** III.4.16 (441)

CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 441
```

The pre vi ous ar gu ment is con tin ued.
Fur ther, such knowl edge brings the reali sa tion that ev ery thing is
At man or Brah man. How then can the knower act?
Again, far from be ing a part of work, knowl edge puts an end to
all works, all oblig a tory du ties. Mundaka Upanishad de clares, “Brah -
man in both His su pe rior and in fe rior as pects be ing real ised, the knot
of the heart (ego ism, etc.) is cut down, all doubts are dis pelled and
works are de stroyed” (Mun. Up. II.2.9).
Knowl edge of Brah man an ni hi lates all ig no rance and its ef fects
like agent, deed and fruit, “But when to the Knower of Brah man ev ery -
thing has be come the Self, then what should one see and through
what?” (Bri. Up. IV.5.15). The know l edge of Brah man is an tag o nis tic
to all ac tions. Hence it can not be sub sid iary to work. It is in de pend ent.

**Urdhvaretassu cha sabde hi** III.4.17 (442)

And (knowledge belongs) to those who observe perpetual
celibacy, because in scripture (that stage of life is mentioned).

**Urdhvaretassu:** to those who observe perpetual celibacy, in those
stages of life where the sexual energy has an upward flow; **Cha:** and;
**Sabde:** in the Sruti; **Hi:** because.

The pre vi ous ar gu ment is con tin ued.
Fur ther the Sruti de clares Jnana in re la tion to Sannyasins.
Knowl edge is said to be in Sannyasins. They have not to do any Kar -
mas. Such Sannyasa can be taken even with out go ing through the
house holder’s life.
Scrip ture shows that knowl edge is valid also for the stages of life
for which per pet ual cel i bacy is pre scribed. Now in their case knowl -
edge can not be sub or di nate to work, be cause work is ab sent, be -
cause the works pre scribed by Vedas such as the Agnihotra are not
per formed by men who have reached those stages. To a Sannyasin
there is no work pre scribed ex cept en quiry of Brah man and med i ta -
tion on the Su preme Self. So how can knowl edge be sub or di nate to
work?
We find from the Sruti texts that there is a stage of life called
Sannyasa. “There are three branches of duty” (Chh. Up. II.23.1).
“Those who in the for est prac tise faith and aus ter ity” (Chh. Up.
V.10.1). “Those who prac tise pen ance and faith in the for est” (Mun.
Up. I.10. 1 1). “Wish ing for that world only, men di cants re nounce their
homes and wan der forth” (Bri. Up. IV.4.22). “Let him wan der forth at
once from the state of studentship.” “All these at tain to the worlds of
the vir tu ous; but only one who is fi nally es tab lished in Brah man, at -
tains im mor tal ity.” (Chh. Up. II.23.1-2).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 442
```

Ev ery one can take to this life, with out be ing a house holder etc.
This in di cates the in de pend ence of knowl edge.
Thus, the the ory of Jaimini that Knowl edge is sub or di nate to
Karma has no legs to stand upon, and has been re futed.

Paramarsadhikaranam: Topic 2 (Sutras 18-20)
Sannyasa is prescribed by the scriptures
```
**nam_eª O¡{_{ZaMmoXZm MmndX{V {hŸ&**

**Paramarsam jaiminirachodana chapavadati hi** III.4.18 (443)

Jaimini (considers that scriptural texts mentioning those
stages of life in which celibacy is obligatory, contain) a
reference (only to those stages; they are not injunctions;
because other (scriptural texts) condemn (those stages).

**Paramarsam:** a passing allusion, mere reference; **Jaiminih:** Jaimini;
**Achodana:** there is no clear injunction; **Cha:** and; **Apavadati:**
condemns; **Hi:** because, clearly, certainly.

An ob jec tion to Su tra 17 is raised.
Jaimini says that in the text quoted in the last Su tra (Chh. Up.
II.23.1), there is no word in di cat ing that Sannyasa is en joined on man.
It is a mere ref er ence only but not an in junc tion.
The Brihadaranyaka text quoted in the last Su tra de clares that
some per sons do like Sannyasa. Sruti here makes a state ment of
fact. It does not en join Sannyasa.
Thus there is no di rect Sruti for Sannyasa though there are
Smritis and Achara (us age). But if we say that there is no Sruti for the
house holder’s life, he (Jaimini) would re ply that Kar mas like
Agnihotra are en joined by Sruti.
Fur ther, the text here glo ri fies stead fast ness in Brah man. “But
only one who is firmly es tab lished in Brah man at tains Im mor tal ity.”
Sac ri fice, study, char ity, aus ter ity, studentship and life-long con ti -
nence be stow the fruit of ob tain ing heaven. But Im mor tal ity is at tained
only by one who is firmly es tab lished in Brah man.
More over, there are other Sruti pas sages which con demn
Sannyasa. “Hav ing brought to your teacher his proper re ward, do not
cut off the line of chil dren” (Tait. Up. I.11.1). “To him who is with out a
son this world does not be long; all beasts even know that” (Tait. Br.
VII.13.12).

**AZwîR>o`§ ~mXam`U... gmå`lwVo...Ÿ&**

**Anushtheyam baadarayanah samyasruteh** III.4.19 (444)

Baadarayana (holds that Sannyasa) also must be gone
through, because the scriptural text (quoted) refers equally to
all the four Asramas or stages of life.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 443
```

**Anushtheyam:** should be practised; **Baadarayanah:** Baadarayana,

the author of the Sutras; **Samyasruteh:** for the scriptural text refers

equally to all the four Asramas.

The ob jec tion raised in Su tra 18 is re futed.
In the text quoted sac ri fice re fers to the house holder’s life, aus -
ter ity to Vanaprastha, studentship to Brahmacharya, and one who is
firmly es tab lished in Brah man to Sannyasa. So the text re fers equally
to all the four stages of life. The text that re lates to the first three
stages re fers to what is en joined else where. So also does the text that
re lates to Sannyasa.
There fore, Sannyasa also is en joined and must be gone
through by all.
Baadarayana holds that Sannyasa is an ap pro pri ate Asrama
like Grihastha Asrama (house holder’s life), be cause both are re ferred
to in Sruti. The word Tapas re fers to a dif fer ent Asrama in which the
pre dom i nant fac tor is Tapas.

**{d{Ydm© YmaUdV²Ÿ&**

**Vidhirva dharanavat** III.4.20 (445)
Or rather (there is an) injunction (in this text) as in the case of
carrying (of the sacrificial wood).

**Vidhih:** injunction; **Va:** or rather; **Dharanavat:** as in the case of

carry ing (of the sacrificial wood).

The ar gu ment com menced in Su tra 19 to re fute the ob jec tion
raised in Su tra 18 is con tin ued.
This Su tra now tries to es tab lish that there is an in junc tion about
Sannyasa in the Chhandogya text quoted. The pas sage is rather to
be un der stood as con tain ing an in junc tion, not a mere ref er ence.
The case is anal o gous to that of ‘car ry ing’. There is a scrip tural
text re lat ing to the Agnihotra which forms part of the Mahapitriyajna
which is per formed for the manes. “Let him ap proach car ry ing the
sac ri fi cial wood be low the la dle hold ing the of fer ing; for above he car -
ries it to the gods.” Jaimini in ter prets the last clause as an in junc tion
al though there is no word in it to that ef fect, for such an in junc tion is
no where else to be found in the scrip tures. Fol low ing this ar gu ment,
this Su tra de clares that there is an in junc tion as re gards Sannyasa
and not a mere ref er ence in Chh. Up. II.23.1, as it is not en joined any -
where else.
Even if in the Sruti there is only Anuvada (dec la ra tion) of other
Asramas, the Purvamimamsika rules show that we must in fer a Vidhi
(in junc tion) of Sannyasa from the por tion: “ _Brahma-
samstho’mritatvameti_ ”, be cause there is no other sep a rate in junc tion
just as there is no com mand that the Samit should be kept on the up -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 444
```

per por tion of the Sruk and yet the Purvamimamsa says that such
com mand should be in ferred.
In the pres ent case also the same rule of con struc tion should be
ap plied. Fur ther, even if there is only a dec la ra tion and not an in junc -
tion as re gards the other Asramas, we must in fer an in junc tion about
Sannyasa as it has been spe cially glo ri fied.
Fur ther there are Sruti pas sages which di rectly en join
Sannyasa, “Or else he may wan der forth from the stu dent’s life, or
from the house, or from the for est” (Jabala Upanishad 4). Hence the
ex is tence of Sannyasa Asrama is un de ni able.
The word Tapas in the Sruti re fers to Vanaprastha whereas the
spe ci al ity of Sannyasa is con trol of the senses (Indriya Samyama).
The Sruti dif fer en ti ates Sannyasa and says that those be long ing to
the other three Asramas go to the Punya Lokas whereas the
Sannyasin at tains Amritatva (Im mor tal ity).
Jaimini him self says that even glo ri fi ca tion must be in a com pli -
men tary re la tion to an in junc tion. In the text, stead fast de vo tion to
Brahma is em ployed. Hence it has an in junc tive value. “Brahma
Samstha” means med i tat ing al ways on Brah man. It is a state of be ing
grounded in Brah man to the ex clu sion of all other ac tiv i ties. In the
case of other Asramas: that is not pos si ble as they have their own
Kar mas. But it is pos si ble to Sannyasins as they have aban doned
Kar mas. Their Sama (se ren ity) and Dama (self-re straint) help them
to wards it and are not ob sta cles.
Sannyasa is not pre scribed only for those who are blind, lame,
etc., and who are, there fore, not fit for per form ing rit u als. Sannyasa is
a means for the reali sa tion of Brah man. It must be taken in a reg u lar
pre scribed man ner. The Sruti de clares, “The wan der ing men di cant,
with or ange-col oured robe, shaven, wife less, pure, guile less, liv ing
on alms, ac cept ing no gifts, qual i fies him self for the reali sa tion of
Brah man” (Jabali Sruti).
There fore, Sannyasa is pre scribed by the scrip tures. As knowl -
edge is en joined on Sannyasins, it is in de pend ent of works.

Stutimatradhikaranam: Topic 3 (Sutras 21-22)
Scriptural texts as in Chh. Up. I.1.3. which refer to Vidyas are not

**Stutimatramupadanaditi chennapurvatvat** III.4.21 (446)

If it be said that (texts such as the one about the Udgitha are)
mere glorifications on account of their reference (to parts of
sacrifices), (we say) not so, on account of the newness (of what
they teach, if viewed as injunctions).

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 445
```

**Stutimatram:** mere praise; **Upadanat:** on account of their reference

(to parts of sacrificial acts); **Iti:** thus, so; **Chet:** if; **Na:** not so;

**Apurvatvat:** on account of its newness. ( **Iti chet:** if it be said).

This Su tra con sists ot two parts, namely an ob jec tion and its re -
ply. The ob jec tion por tion is: ‘ _Stutimatramupadanaditi chet_ ’, and the
re ply por tion is: ‘ _Na apurvatvat_ ’.
“That Udgitha (OM) is the best of all es sences, the high est,
hold ing the high est place, the eighth” (Chh. Up. I.1.3). “This earth is
the Rik, the fire is Saman” (Chh. Up. I.6.1). “This world in truth is that
piled up fire-al tar” (Sat. Br. X.1.2.2). “That hymn is truly that earth”
(Ait. Ar. II.1.2.1).
A doubt arises whether these pas sages are meant to glo rify the
Udgitha or to en join de vout med i ta tions.
The Purvapakshin main tains that these are mere praise and no
in junc tion to med i tate on ‘OM’ and so on. These pas sages are anal o -
gous to pas sages such as “This earth is the la dle”. “The sun is the tor -
toise.” “The heav enly world is the Ahavaniya” which sim ply glo rify the
la dle and so on.
The lat ter half of the pres ent Su tra re futes the view of the op po -
nent.
In the Sruti pas sage “That Udgitha (OM) is the best es sence of
the es sences” etc., the de scrip tion is not mere praise but is a Vidhi,
and it tells us some thing which is new.
The anal ogy is in cor rect. Glorificatory pas sages are of use in so
far as en ter ing into a com pli men tary re la tion to in junc tive pas sages,
but the pas sages un der dis cus sion are not ca pa ble of en ter ing into
such a re la tion to the Udgitha and so on which are en joined in al to -
gether dif fer ent places of the Vedas and would be pur pose less as far
as the glo ri fi ca tion is con cerned. Pas sages such as “This earth is the
la dle” are not anal o gous be cause they stand in prox im ity to in junc tive
pas sages, and so they can be taken as praise.
There fore, the texts such as those un der dis cus sion have an in -
junc tive pur pose. On ac count of the new ness, these are not mere
praise but an in junc tion.

**^mdeãXmƒŸ&**

**Bhavasabdaccha** III.4.22 (447)

And there being words expressive of injunction.

**Bhavasabaat:** from words indicative of existence of injunction in

The ar gu ment com menced in Su tra 21 is con cluded.
“Let one med i tate on OM or the Udgitha” (Chh. Up. I.1.1). We
have a very clear in junc tion to med i tate on OM in this pas sage. On the
face of this we can not in ter pret the text quoted in the last Su tra as

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 446

mere praise of OM. The ex pres sion “This is the best of all the es -
sences” in the pas sage cited un der the pre ced ing Su tra is not a mere
glorificatory ex pres sion, but it amounts to an in junc tion for the Udgitha
med i ta tion.

Pariplavadhikaranam: Topic 4 (Sutras 23-24)
The stories mentioned in the Upanishads do not serve the purpose
of Pariplavas and so do not form part of the ritualistic acts.
They are meant to euloisge the Vidya taught in them
```
**n[aßbdmWm© B{V MoÞ {deo{fVËdmV²Ÿ&**

**Pariplavartha iti chenna viseshitatvat** III.4.23 (448)

If it be said (that the stories told in the Upanishads) are for the
purpose of Pariplava (only, we say) not so, because (certain
stories above) are specified (by the Sruti for this purpose).

**Pariplavarthah:** for the purpose of Pariplavas; **Iti:** so; **Chet:** if; **Na:**
not so; **Viseshitatvat:** because of specification, on account of
(certain stories alone) being specified. ( **Iti chet:** if it be said.)

The pur pose of nar ra tion of sto ries in the Upanishads is stated
in this Su tra and in the next one.
This Su tra con sists of two parts namely, an ob jec tion and its re -
ply. The ob jec tion por tion is ‘ _Pariplavartha iti chet_ ’. And the re ply is:
‘ _Na viseshitatvat_ ’.
In the Asvamedha sac ri fice the priest re cites sto ries to the king
who per forms the Asvamedha sac ri fice, and his rel a tives at in ter vals
dur ing the per for mance of the sac ri fice. These are known as
Pariplavas and form part of the rit u al is tic acts.
The ques tion is whether the sto ries of the Upanishads such as
those re lat ing to Yajnavalkya and Maitreyi (Bri. Up. IV.5.1),
Pratardana (Kau. Up. III.1), Janasruti (Chh. Up. IV.1.1), and so on
also serve this pur pose in which case they be come part of the rites,
and the whole of Jnana Kanda be comes sub or di nate to Karma
Kanda.
The Purvapakshin holds that those sto ries of the Upanishads
serve the pur pose of Pariplava, be cause they are sto ries like oth ers
and be cause the tell ing of sto ries is en joined for the Pariplava. From
this it fol lows that the Upanishadic sto ries and Vedanta texts do not
chiefly aim at knowl edge, be cause like Mantras they stand in a com -
pli men tary re la tion to sac ri fi cial acts.

And so (they are meant to illustrate the nearest Vidyas), being
connected as one coherent whole.

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 447
```

**Tatha:** so, similarly; **Cha:** and; **Ekavakyatopabandhat:** being
connected as one whole. ( **Ekavakya:** unity of construction or of
statements or that of sense; **Upabandhat:** because of connection.)

The dis cus sion com menced in Su tra 23 is con cluded here.
There fore, it is for the pur pose of praise of Vidya be cause only
then there would be unity of idea in the con text. Only such a view will
lead to har mony of the con text.
The sto ries of the Upanishads are to be re garded as es sen tial
parts of Brahma Vidya. They are in tro duced only to fa cil i tate an in tel li -
gent group ing of the sub ject. The sto ries are in tended to in tro duce the
Vidyas. The story form cre ates more at ten tion and in ter est on the part
of the as pi rant. Their ob ject is to make it clear to our un der stand ing in
a con crete form, the Vidyas taught in other por tions of the
Upanishads in the ab stract.
Why do we say so? _Ekavakyatopabandhat_. Be cause of their
syn tac ti cal con nec tion with the Vidyas taught in the suc ceed ing pas -
sages.
Thus in the story be gin ning with “Yajnavalkya had two wives”,
etc., we find im me di ately fol low ing in that very sec tion, the Vidya
taught about the At man in these words “The At man is ver ily to be
seen, to be heard of, to be med i tated upon.” As these sto ries are im -
me di ately pre ceded or suc ceeded by in struc tions about Brah man, we
in fer that they are meant to glo rify the Vidyas and are not Pariplava
sto ries. The sto ries are told in or der to fa cil i tate the un der stand ing of
these ab struse sub jects and they are em i nently fit ted to sub serve that
pur pose.

And, therefore, there is no necessity of the lighting of the fire

**Ata eva:** therefore, only, for this reason only; **Cha:** and, also; **Agni:**
fire; **Indhanadi:** fire-wood, and so on, kindling fire and performing
sacrifices, etc.; **Anapeksha:** no need, has not to be depended upon.
( **Agni-indhanadi-anapeksha:** no necessity of lighting fires, etc.)

This Su tra states that the seeker of Brah man may dis pense with
sac ri fi cial rites.
Brahma Vidya has no need for fire, fire-wood, etc. It is by it self
the cause of eman ci pa tion.
In Su tra III.4.1 it was stated that the knowl edge of Brah man re -
sults in the at tain ment of the high est Purushartha or goal of life. The

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 448
```

ex pres sion “ _Ata Eva_ ” (for this rea son alone) must be viewed as tak ing
up Su tra III.4.1 be cause thus a sat is fa c tory sense is es tab lished. For
this very same rea son, i.e., be cause knowl edge serves the pur pose
of Sannyasins, the light ing of the sac ri fi cial fire and sim i lar works
which are en joined on the house hold ers, etc., need not be ob served
by them.
Thus the Sutrakara sums up the re sult of this first Adhikarana,
in tend ing to make some fur ther re marks.
As a Sannyasin, de voted to the med i ta tion on Brah man is stated
in Sruti to at tain im mor tal ity and not any of the re wards aris ing from
sac ri fi cial rites, he is not re quired to have re course to sac ri fi cial works
to be per formed with fire, fire-wood and so on. Chhandogya
Upanishad de clares, “ _Brahmasamstho’amrita tvameti_ —One de voted
to Brah man at tains Im mor tal ity” (Chh. Up. II.23.1).
The the ory or doc trine that knowl edge and work must be com -

We may con clude from the pre vi ous Su tra that works are al to -
gether use less.
This Su tra says that all these works are use ful for orig i na tion of
knowl edge. Even the scrip tures pre scribe them as they serve an in di -
rect means to the at tain ment of knowl edge. Brihad aranyaka
Upanishad de clares, “Brahmanas seek to know Brah man by the
study of the Vedas, by scrip tures, gifts, pen ance and re nun ci a tion”
(Bri. Up. IV.4.22). Sim i larly the pas sage, “what peo ple call sac ri fice
that is re ally Brahmacharya” (Chh. Up. VIII.5.1), by con nect ing sac ri -
fices and so on with Bra hmacharya which is a means of knowl edge,
in ti mates that sac ri fices, etc., also are means of knowl edge. Again

the pas sage “That word which all the Vedas re cord, which all pen -
ances pro claim, de sir ing which men live as re li gious stu dents, that
word I tell thee briefly, it is OM” (Katha Up. I.2.15), like wise in ti mates
that the works en joined on the Asramas are means of knowl edge.
When knowl edge once is at tained re quires no help from ex ter -
nal works for the pro duc tion of this re sult namely, Lib er a tion. The
case is anal o gous to a horse, whose help is re quired un til the place of
des ti na tion is reached but it may be dis pensed with af ter the jour ney
has been ac com plished.
When Atma-Jnana is at tained it does not need any other ac ces -
sory to bring about sal va tion, but Karma is needed for Atma-Jnana.
Just as a horse is not used to drag a plough but is used to drag a car,
so the Asrama Kar mas are not needed for the fru ition of Jnana but are
needed for Jnana.
The fi nal eman ci pa tion re sults only from knowl edge of Brah man
and not from work. Work pu ri fies the mind and knowl edge dawns in a
pure mind.
Hence works are use ful as they are an in di rect means to knowl -
edge.
If knowl edge be orig i nated by sac ri fices, gifts, pen ance and fast -
ing, what is the ne ces sity of other qual i fi ca tions like Sama (se ren ity)
and Dama (self-re straint)? To this the au thor re plies in the next Su tra.

**Samadamadyupetah syat tathapi tu tadvidhestadangataya
teshamavasyanushtheyatvat** III.4.27 (452)

But all the same (even though there is no injunction to do
sacrificial acts to attain knowledge in the Brihadaranyaka text)
one must possess serenity, self-control and the like, as these
are enjoined as auxiliaries to knowledge and therefore have
neces sarily to be practised.

**Samadamadyupetah syat:** one must possess serenity, self-control
and the like; **Tathapi:** still, all the same, even if it be so; **Tu:** verily;
**Tadvidheh:** as they are enjoined; **Tadangataya:** on account of their
being a part, as helps to knowledge; **Tesham:** their;
**Avasyanushtheyatvat:** because it being necessary to be practised.
( **Avasya:** necessarily; **Anushtheyatvat:** because they must be
practised.)

Brihadaranyaka Upanishad de clares, “The Brahmanas seek to
know Brah man through the study of the Vedas, sac ri fices, char ity,”
etc. (Bri. Up. IV.4.22). In this pas sage there is no word to in di cate that
sac ri fice is en joined on one who wants to know Brah man.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 450
```

So the Purvapakshin main tains that there is no ne ces sity at all
for work for one who as pires af ter knowl edge.
This pres ent Su tra says that even should this be so. The seeker
for knowl edge must pos sess calm ness of mind, must sub due his
senses and so on; be cause all this is en joined as a means of knowl -
edge in the fol low ing scrip tural pas sage, “There he who knows this,
hav ing be come calm, sub dued, sat is fied, pa tient and col lected sees
Self in Self” (Bri. Up. IV.4.23).
What is en joined must nec es sar ily be car ried out. The in tro duc -
tory word ‘there fore’ (Tasmat) which ex presses the praise of the sub -
ject un der dis cus sion makes us un der stand that the pas sage has an
in junc tive char ac ter, be cause if there were no in junc tion, the praise
would be mean ing less.
Fur ther the Madhyandina Sruti uses the word “pasyet” let him

see and not ‘he sees’. Hence calm ness of mind, etc., are re quired
even if sac ri fices, etc., should not be re quired.
As these qual i ties are en joined, they are nec es sar ily to be prac -
tised. Sama, Dama etc., are prox i mate or di rect means of knowl edge
(Antaranga-Sadhana). Yajnas or sac ri fices, etc., are re mote or in di -
rect means of knowl edge (Bahiranga-Sadhana).
The word ‘Adi’ (and the rest) men tioned in the Su tra, in di cates
that the as pi rant af ter Brahma Vidya must pos sess all these qual i fi ca -
tions of truth ful ness, gen er os ity, as cet i cism, cel i bacy, in dif fer ence to
worldly ob jects, tol er ance, en dur ance, faith, equi lib rium, com pas sion

**gdm©ÞmZw_{Vü àmUmË``o VÔe©ZmV²Ÿ&**

**Sarvannanumatischa pranatyaye taddarsanat** III.4.28 (453)

Only when life is in danger (there is) permission to take all food
(i.e., take food indiscriminately) because the Sruti declares
that.

**Sarvannanumatih:** permission to take all sorts of food; **Cha:** only;
**Prana tyaye:** when life is in danger; **Taddarsanat:** because the Sruti
declares that.

This and the sub se quent three Sutras in di cate what kind of food
is to be taken.
Chhandogya Upanishad de clares, “For one who knows this,
there is noth ing that is not food” (Chh. Up. V.2.1). The ques tion is if
such Sarvannanumati (de scrip tion of all as his food) is a Vidhi or
Vidhyanga or a Sruti (praise).

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 451
```

The Purvapakshin main tains that it is en joined on one who med -
i tates on Prana on ac count of the new ness of the state ment. It has an
in junc tive value, as such state ment is not found any where else.
The Su tra re futes it and de clares that it is not an in jun c tion, but
only a state ment of fact. We are not jus ti fied in as sum ing an in junc -
tion, where the idea of an in junc tion does not arise. It is not Vidhi or in -
junc tion as no man da tory words are found. Can a man eat and di gest
all things? No. Pro hi b ited food may be eaten only when life is in dan -
ger, when one is dy ing of hun ger as was done by the sage
Chakrayana (Ushasti) when he was dy ing for want of food. Sruti de -
clares this.
Sage Ushasti was dy ing of hun ger on ac count of fam ine. He ate
the beans half-eaten by a keeper of el e phants but re fused to drink
what had been of fered by the lat ter on the ground of its be ing a mere
leav ing. The sage jus ti fied his con duct by say ing, “I would not have
lived, if I had not eaten the beans, but wa ter I can do with out at pres -
ent. I can drink wa ter wher ever I like.”
From this it fol lows, that the pas sage “For one who knows this”
etc., is an Arthavada.

**A~mYmƒŸ&**

**Abadhaccha** III.4.29 (454)
And because (thus) (the scriptural statements with respect to
food) are not contradicted.

**Abadhat:** becausc of a non-contradiction, as there is no contrary
state ment anywhere in Sruti; **Cha:** and, also, moreover, on account of
non-sublation.

The topic com menced in Su tra 28 is con tin ued.
And thus those scrip tural pas sages which dis tin guish law ful and
un law ful food such as “When the food is pure the whole na ture be -
comes pure” (Chh. Up. VII.26.2) are non-sub lat ed. The state ment of
the Chhandogya Upanishad will not be con tra dicted only if the ex pla -
na tion given is taken, and not oth er wise.
Only then other Srutis will have un hin dered ap pli ca tions. Only in
this view will the Sruti “When the food is pure the mind be comes pure”
have ap pli ca tion.
Clean food should gen er ally be taken as there is no con trary
state ment any where in Sruti to the pu ri fy ing ef fect of clean food.
There is no where any pas sage in Sruti, con tra dict ing the pas sage of
the Chhandogya Sruti which de clares that clean food makes our na -
ture pure.
Un law ful food as a gen eral rule clogs the un der stand ing and ob -
structs the clear works of the in tel lect. But in the case of the sage,
whose heart is al ways pure and in tel lect keen, the tak ing of such food

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 452
```

does not ob struct the work ing of his brain, and his knowl edge re mains
as pure as ever.

**A{n M ñ_`©VoŸ&**

**Api cha smaryate** III.4.30 (455)
And moreover the Smritis say so.

**Api:** also; **Cha:** moreover; **Smaryate:** the Smriti says so, it is seen in
the Smritis, it is prescribed by Smriti.

```
The pre vi ous topic is con tin ued.
Smriti also states that when life is in dan ger both he who has
```
knowl edge and he who has not can take any food. “He who eats food
pro cured from any where when life is in dan ger, is not tainted by sin,
as a lo tus leaf is not wet ted by wa ter.”
On the con trary many pas sages teach that un law ful food is to be

avoided. “The Brahmana must per ma nently forego in tox i cat ing li -
quor”. “Let them pour boil ing spir its down the throat of a Brahmana

who drinks spir its”. “Spirit-drink ing worms grow in the mouth of the
spirit-drink ing man, be cause he en joys what is un law ful.”
From this it is in ferred that gen er ally clean food is to be taken ex -
cept in the case of ex treme star va tion or in times of dis tress only.
When the Upanishad says that the sage may eat all kinds of

food, it must be in ter preted as mean ing that he may eat all kinds of
food, in times of dis tress only. The text of the Upanishad should not be

con strued as an in junc tion in fa vour of eat ing un law ful food.

**eãXümVmo@H$m_H$maoŸ&**

**Sabdaschato’kamakare** III.4.31 (456)

And hence the scripture prohibiting license.

**Sabdah:** the scriptural passage; **Cha:** and; **Atah:** hence;
**Akamakare:** to prevent undue license, prohibiting license, as to
non-proceeding according to liking.

```
The pre vi ous topic is dis cussed and con cluded here.
There are scrip tural pas sages which pro hibit one from do ing ev -
```
ery thing just as he pleases, which for bid man to take un due lib erty in
the mat ter of food and drink. “There fore a Brahmana must not drink li -
quor” (Kathaka Sam.). Per fect spir i tual dis ci pline is ab so lutely nec es -

sary for con trol ling the mind and the senses and at tain ing knowl edge
or Self-reali sa tion. Such Sruti texts are meant for this dis ci pline.
There fore, it is es tab lished that the Sruti does not en join on one

who med i tates on Prana to take all kinds of food in dis crim i nately.
As there is Sruti which for bids li cense in food and drink, the Sruti
re ferred to above in Su tra 28 is an Arthavada.

CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 453

Asramakarmadhikaranam: Topic 8 (Sutras 32-35)
The duties of Asrama are to be performed by
even one who is not desirous of salvation
```
**{d{hVËdmƒml_H$_m©{nŸ&**

**Vihitatvacchasramakarmapi** III.4.32 (457)
And the duties of the Asramas (are to be performed also by him
who does not desire emancipation) because they are enjoined
(on him by the scriptures).

**Vihitatvat:** because they are enjoined; **Cha:** and; **Asrama-karma:**
duties of the Asrama, or order of life; **Api:** also.

This and the sub se quent three Sutras show who are re quired to
per form sac ri fices and do other pre scribed du ties.
Un der Su tra 26 it has been proved that the works en joined on
the Asramas are means to knowl edge. The ques tion arises now, why
should one who does not de sire knowl edge or fi nal re lease do these
works?
The pres ent Su tra de clares that since these du ties are en joined
on all who are in these Aramas or or ders of life, viz., stu dent-life,
house holder’s life, and her mit life, one should ob serve them.
In the case of a man who keeps to the Asramas but does not
seek lib er a tion, the Nityakarmas or the per ma nent oblig a tory du ties
are in dis pens able. The Sruti says “ _Yavajjivam agnihotram juhoti_ —as
long as his life lasts, one is to of fer the Agnihotra.”

**ghH$m[aËdoZ M**

**Sahakaritvena cha** III.4.33 (458)

And (the duties are to be performed also) as a means to
knowledge.

**Sahakaritvena:** as, an auxiliary, on account of cooperativeness, as
means to knowledge; **Cha:** and.

The topic com menced in Su tra 32 is con tin ued.
The du ties or works are help ful in pro duc ing knowl edge but not
its fruit, viz., eman ci pa tion. In the for mer case the con nec tion be -
tween Karma and fruit is in sep a ra ble (Nitya-Samyoga), but in the lat -
ter case it is sep a ra ble (Anitya-Samyoga). Sal va tion or Moksha is
at tain able only through knowl edge of Brah man or Brahma-Jnana.
Works (Kar mas) are an aid to Vidya or knowl edge of Self. Those
who are de sir ous of eman ci pa tion should also per form re li gious rites
as a help to en light en ment. Brahma Vidya is in de pend ent in pro duc -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 454
```

ing its re sults. Karma is merely the hand maid and co op er a tor of

Vidya. Works are means for the orig i na tion of knowl edge.

**gd©Wm{n V Edmo^`{b“mV²Ÿ&**

**Sarvathapi ta evobhayalingat** III.4.34 (459)

In all cases the same duties (have to be performed), because of
the twofold indicatory marks.

**Sarvatha:** in all cases, in every respect, under any circumstance;
**Api:** also; **Ta eva:** the same duties (have to be performed);
**Ubhayalingat:** because of the twofold inferential signs. ( **Ta:** they, the
sacrificial works; **Eva:** certainly.)

The pre vi ous topic is con tin ued.
The word ‘Api’ in the Su tra has the force of ‘in deed’, ‘even’. The
words ‘Sarvatha Api’ are equal to ‘Sarvatha Eva’.

The ques tion arises whether the works per formed as en joined
on the Asramas, and those done as aux il ia ries to knowl edge are of
two dif fer ent kinds.

The pres ent Su tra de clares that in ei ther case, whether viewed
as du ties in cum bent on the Asramas or as co op er at ing with knowl -
edge, the very same Agnihotra and other du ties have to be per -
formed, as is seen from the Sruti and the Smriti texts.

Brihadaranyaka Upanishad de clares, “Him the Brahmanas
seek to know through the study of the Vedas, sac ri fices etc.” (Bri. Up.
IV.4.22). This text in di cates that sac ri fices etc., en joined in
Karmakanda for dif fer ent pur poses are to be per formed as means to
knowl edge also.
The Smriti also says the same thing, “He who per forms oblig a -

tory works with out aim ing at the fruit of work” etc. (Gita VI.1). Those

very oblig a tory du ties sub serve the orig i na tion of knowl edge also.
More over the Smriti pas sage “He who is qual i fied by that

forty-eighty purifications” etc., re fers to the purifications re quired for

Ve dic works, with a view to the orig i na tion of knowl edge in him who

has un der gone these purifications.
In ev ery re spect, whether viewed as du ties in cum bent on a

house holder or as prac tices aux il iary to knowl edge or il lu mi na tion,

the sac ri fi cial works, pre scribed to be per formed, are re cog nised to

be the same and not dif fer ent, be cause they are in dis pens able req ui -

sites for both or ders of life, as per ma nent du ties for a house holder

and as aux il iary aids to med i ta tion for a Sannyasi.

The Sutrakara, there fore, rightly emphasises the non-dif fer ence
of the works.

**Anabhibhavam cha darsayati** III.4.35 (460)

Brahmacharya) is not overpowered (by passion, anger, etc.).

**Anabhibhavam:** not being overpowered; **Cha:** and; **Darsayati:** the
scrip ture shows, the Srutis declare.

The pre vi ous topic is con cluded here.
This Su tra points out a fur ther indicatory mark strength en ing the
con clu sion that works co op er ate to wards knowl edge. Scrip ture also
de clares that he who is en dowed with such means as Brahmacharya,
etc.. is not over pow ered by such af flic tions as pas sion, an ger and the
like. “For that Self does not per ish which one at tains by
Brahmacharya” (Chh. Up. VIII.5.3). This pas sage in di cates that like
work, Brahmacharya, etc., are also means to knowl edge. He who is
en dowed with cel i bacy is not over come by an ger, pas sion, jeal ousy,
ha tred. His mind is ever peace ful. As his mind is not ag i tated, he is
able to prac tise deep and con stant med i ta tion which leads to the at -
tain ment of knowl edge.
It is thus a set tled con clu sion that works are oblig a tory on the
Asramas and are also means to knowl edge.

The word ‘tu’ is em ployed in or der to re fute the Purvapaksha
that Karma is nec es sary for the orig i na tion of knowl edge of Brah man.

A doubt arises whether per sons in want who do not pos sess
means, etc., and, there fore, are not able to en ter into one or the other
of the Asramas, or who stand mid way be tween two Asramas as for
ex am ple, a wid ower, are qual i fied for knowl edge or not.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 456
```

The Purvapakshin main tains that they are not qual i fied, as they
can not per form the works of any Asrama which are means to knowl -
edge.
The pres ent Su tra de clares that they are en ti tled, be cause such
cases are seen from the scrip tures. Scrip tural pas sages de clare that
per sons of that class such as Raikva and Gargi, the daugh ter of
Vachaknavi had the knowl edge of Brah man (Chh. Up. IV.1 and Bri.

Up. III.6.8).
Vidura, a man who had no wife, did not adopt the Vanaprastha
Asrama, and who had no Asrama, was ex pert in Brahma Vidya. He
had knowl edge of Brah man.
Antara (who stand out side) are those per sons who do not be -
long to any or der or Asrama and con se quently do not per form the du -
ties of any Asrama. They are born in this life with dis crim i na tion and
dispassion ow ing to the per for mance of such du ties in their pre vi ous
birth. Their minds have been pu ri fied by truth, pen ance, prayers, etc.,

per formed in their past lives. If a man has duly dis charged the du ties
of his Asrama in pre vi ous birth, but ow ing to some ob sta cles or
Pratibandhas Brahma-Jnana did not arise in him in that life, and he
dies be fore the dawn of knowl edge, then he is born in the pres ent life
ripe for knowl edge. Brahma-Jnana man i fests in him in all its glory by
mere con tact with a sage. There fore such a man does not per form

any Kar mas or rather does not stand in any need of per form ing any
du ties of Asramas.

**A{n M ñ_`©VoŸ&**

**Api cha smaryate** III.4.37 (462)

This is stated in Smriti also.

**Api:** also, too; **Cha:** moreover, and; **Smaryate:** is stated in Smriti, the
Smriti records such cases.

The pre vi ous topic is con tin ued.
More over, it is stated also in Smriti that per sons, not be long ing
to any one of the four pre scribed or ders of life, ac quire
Brahma-Jnana.
It is re corded in the Itihasas (Mahabharata) also how Samvarta
and oth ers who paid no re gard to the du ties in cum bent on the
Asramas went na ked and af ter wards be came great Yogins or saints.

The great Bhishma is also an in stance in point.
Manu Samhita de clares “There is no doubt that a Brahmana at -
tains fi nal suc cess only by prac tice of con tin u ously re peat ing the
Japa. It mat ters lit tle whether he per forms other pre scribed du ties or
not. One who is friendly to all, is re ally a Brahmana” (II.87).

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 457

But the in stances quoted from scrip ture and Smriti fur nish
merely indicatory marks. What then is the fi nal con clu sion? That con -
clu sion is stated in the next Su tra.

**Viseshanugrahascha** III.4.38 (463)

And the promotion (of knowledge is bestowed on them)
through special acts.

**Visesha:** special; **Anugrahah:** favour; **Cha:** and. ( **Viseshanu-
grahah:** special advantage, advantage or favour accruing from
extraordinary good works done in the previous life.)

The pre vi ous topic is con tin ued.
More over knowl edge of Brah man may be at tained by the spe -
cial grace of the gods due to Japa, fast ing and wor ship of gods. Or it
may be that Asrama Kar mas might have been done in pre vi ous births.
A wid ower who is not a house holder in the proper sense of the
term, can at tain knowl edge of Brah man through spe cial acts like
Japa, fast ing, prayer, which are not op posed to the con di tion of those
who do not be long to any Asrama.
The Smriti says “By mere prayer no doubt the Brahmana per -
fects him self. May he per form other works or not, the kind-hearted
one is called Brahmana” (Manu Samhita II.87).
This pas sage in di cates that where the works of the Asramas are
not pos si ble, prayer qual i fies for knowl edge.
Smriti also de clares “Per fected by many births he fi nally goes to
the high est state” (Bhagavad Gita VI.45). This pas sage in ti mates that
the ag gre gate of the dif fer ent mer i to ri ous works per formed in pre vi -
ous births pro motes knowl edge.
There fore, there is no con tra dic tion in ad mit ting qual i fi ca tion for
knowl edge on the part of wid ow ers and the like.

indication, signs, in ferences; **Cha:** and.

The pre vi ous topic is con cluded here.
The word ‘tu’ (but) is em ployed in or der to re move the doubt.
The word ‘cha’ (and) is used in the sense of ex clu sion.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 458

Though it is pos si ble for one who stands be tween two Asramas
to at tain knowl edge, yet it is a better means to know l edge to be long to
some Asrama. He who be longs to an Asrama has better means of at -
tain ing knowl edge of the Self or Brah man, be cause the fa cil i ties are
greater in the lat ter con di tion.
This is con firmed by the Sruti and Smriti “The Brahmanas seek
to know Brah man through sac ri fices” etc. (Bri. Up. IV.4.22). “On that
path goes who ever knows Brah man and who has done holy works as
pre scribed for the Asramas and ob tained splen dour” (Bri. Up. IV.4.9).

But for one who has become that (i.e. entered the highest
Asrama, i.e., Sannyasa) there is no reverting (to the preced ing
ones) on account of restrictions prohibiting such reversion or
descending to a lower order. Jaimini also (is of this opinion).

**Tadbhutasya:** of one who has become that, for one who has attained
that (highest Asrama); **Tu:** but; **Na:** no; **Atadbhavah:** lapse from that
stage, falling away from that; **Jaimineh:** according to Jaimini, of
Jaimini (is this opinion); **Api:** also, even;
**Niyamatadrupabhavebhyah:** on account of the restrictions
prohibiting such reversion. ( **Niyamat:** because of the strict rule;
**Atadrupdbhavebhyah:** because there is no statement permitting it,
and because it is against custom; **Abhavebhyah:** because of the
absence of that.)

The ques tion whether one who has taken Sannyasa can go

The pres ent Su tra de clares that he can not go back to the pre vi -

Expiation for one who has broken the vow of Sannyasa
```
**Z Mm{YH$m[aH$_{n nVZmZw_mZmÎmX`moJmV²Ÿ&**

**Na chadhikarikamapi patananumanattadayogat** III.4.41 (466)

And there is no fitness for expiation in the case of a Naishthika
Brahmacharin (who is immoral), because a fall (in his case) is
inferred from the Smriti and because of the inefficacy (in his
case) of the expiatory ceremony.

**Na:** not; **Cha:** and; **Adhikarikam:** (expiation) mentioned in the
chapter that deals with the qualification; **Api:** also, even;
**Patananumanat:** because of a fall (in his case) is inferred from the
Smriti; **Tadayogat:** because of its (of the expiatory ceremony)
inefficiency in his case.

The pre vi ous dis cus sion is con tin ued.
The pres ent Su tra ex presses the view of the Purvapakshin.
The op po nent main tains that there is no ex pi a tion for such
trans gres sion in the case of a Naishthika Brahmacharin who has
taken the vow of life-long cel i bacy, be cause no such ex pi a tory cer e -
mony is men tioned with re spect to him. The ex pi a tory cer e mony
which is men tioned in Purvamimamsa VI.8.22, re fers to or di nary
Brahmacharins and not to Naishthika Brahmacharins.
Smriti de clares that such sins can not be ex pi ated by him any
more than a head once cut off can again be fixed to the body, “He who
hav ing once en tered on the du ties of a Naishthika again lapses from
them, for him a slayer of the Self, I see no ex pi a tion which might make
him clean again” (Agneya XVI.5.23).
Fur ther the ex pi a tory cer e mony re ferred to in Purvamimamsa is
not ef fi ca cious in his case, be cause he will have to light sac ri fi cial fire
and there fore have to marry. In that case he will cease to be a
Naishthika Brahmacharin there af ter.
But the Upakurvana (i.e., who is a Brahmacharin for a cer tain
pe riod only, not for life, one who is a Brahmacharin till mar riage) about
whose sin Smriti makes no sim i lar dec la ra tion, may pu rify him self by
the cer e mony men tioned. If he is im moral there is ex pi a tion.

**Upapurvamapi tveke bhavamasanavattaduktam** III.4.42 (467)

But some (consider the sin) a minor one (and therefore claim)

the existence (of expiation for the Naishthika Brahmacharin

also); as in the case of eating (of unlawful food). This has been

explained (in the Purvamimamsa).

**Upapurvam:** (Upapurvaka-patakam, Upapatakam) a minor sin; **Api**

**tu:** but, however; **Eke:** some (say); **Bhavam:** possibility of expiation;

**Asanavat:** as in the eating (prohibited food); **Tat:** this; **Uktam:** is

explained (in Purvamimamsa).

The pre vi ous dis cus sion is con tin ued.
Some teach ers, how ever, are of opin ion that the trans gres sion
of the vow of chas tity, even on the part of a Naishthika is a mi nor sin,
not a ma jor one ex cept ing cases where the wife of the teacher is con -

cerned and so can be ex pi ated by proper cer e mo nies just as or di nary
Brahmacharins who take pro hib ited food such as honey, wine, flesh,
are again pu ri fied by ex pi a tory cer e mo nies. They plead that that sin is
not any where enu mer ated among the deadly ones (Mahapataka)
such as vi o lat ing a teacher’s bed and so on. They claim the ex pi a tory

cer e mony to be valid for the Naishthika as well as the Upakurvana.
Both are Brahmacharins and have com mit ted the same of fence.
It is only sex ual in ter course with the wife of the Guru or spir i tual
pre cep tor that is a Mahapataka (ma jor sin). That Upapataka, a mi nor
sin is an expiable sin has been ex plained in the Purvamimamsa of
Jaimini in Chap. I.3.8.
The Smriti pas sage which de clares that there is no ex pi a tion for

the Naishthika must be ex plained as aim ing at the orig i na tion of se ri -
ous ef fort on the part of Naishthika Brahmacharins. It puts him in mind
of the se ri ous re spon si bil ity on his part so that he may be ever alert
and vig i lant and strug gle hard in main tain ing strict un bro ken
Brahmacharya and thus achiev ing the goal or _sum mum bonum_ of life,

i.e., Self-reali sa tion.
Sim i larly in the case of the her mit and the Sannyasin. The Smriti
does pre scribe the pu rif i ca tory cer e mony for both the her mit
(Vanaprastha) and the men di cant (Sannyasi). When the her mit has
bro ken his vows, un der goes the Kricchra-pen ance for twelve nights
and then cul ti vates a place which is full of trees and grass. The

Sannyasi also pro ceeds like the her mit, with the ex cep tion of cul ti vat -
ing the Soma plant, and un der goes the purifications pre scribed for his
state.

**Svaminah phalasruterityatreyah** III.4.44 (469)

To the sacrificer (belongs the agentship in meditations)
because the Sruti declares a fruit (for it): thus Atreya (holds).

**Svaminah:** of the master, of the sacrificer or Yajamana;
**Phalasruteh:** from the declaration in Sruti of the results; **Iti:** so, thus;
**Atreyah:** the sage Atreya (holds).

This is the view of the Purvapakshin or the op po nent.
A doubt arises as to who is to ob serve the med i ta tions con -

whether it is the sac ri ficer (Yajamana) or the priest (Ritvik).
The op po nent, rep re sented by the Sage Atreya, main tains that it
is to be ob served by the sac ri ficer, as the Sruti de clares a spe cial fruit
for these med i ta tions.
“There is rain for him and he brings rain for oth ers who thus
know ing med i tates on the five-fold Saman as rain” (Chh. Up. II.3.2).
Hence the sac ri ficer only is the agent in those med i ta tions which

also fall within the per for mance of the work, as they be long to the

Sahakaryantaravidhyadhikaranam: Topic 14 (Sutras 47-49)
In Bri. Up. III.5.1 meditation is enjoined besides the
child-like state and scholarship
```
**ghH$m`©ÝVa{d{Y... njoU V¥Vr`§ VÛVmo {dÜ`m{XdV²Ÿ&**

**Sahakaryantaravidhih pakshena tritiyam**

**tadvato vidhyadivat** III.4.47 (472)

There is the injunction of something else, i.e., meditation,

cooperation (towards knowledge) (which is) a third thing (with

regard to Balya or state of a child and Panditya or scholarship),

(which injunction is given) for the case (of per fect knowledge

not yet having arisen) to him who is such (i.e., the Sannyasin

possessing knowledge); as in the case of injunctions, and the

like.

**Sahakaryantaravidhih:** a separate auxiliary injunction; **Pakshena:**

as an alternative; **Tritiyam:** the third; **Tadvatah:** for one who

possesses it, (i.e., knowledge); **Vidhyadivat:** just as in the case of

injunctions and the like.

This Su tra ex am ines a pas sage of the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad and con cludes that con tin u ous med i ta tion is also to be
con sid ered as en joined by Sruti for the reali sa tion of Brah man. This
and the fol low ing two Sutras show that the scrip ture en joins the four
or ders of life.
Mauna (Nididhyasa or med i ta tion) is en joined as an aid. The
third, i.e., Mauna is en joined for a Sannyasi in case his sense of cos -
mic di ver sity is per sis tent, just as Yajnas are en joined for one de sir -
ous of heaven.
“There fore, a knower of Brah man, hav ing done with schol ar -
ship, should re main like a child (free from pas sion, an ger, etc.); and
af ter hav ing fin ished with this state and with er u di tion he be comes
med i ta tive (Muni)” (Bri. Up. III.5.1).
A doubt arises now whether the med i ta tive state is en joined or
not.
The Purvapakshin main tains that it is not en joined, as there is
no word in di cat ing an in junc tion. Though the im per a tive mood oc curs
in re gard to Balya or child-like state, there is no such in di ca tion in re -
gard to the Muni. The text merely says that he be comes a Muni or
med i ta tive whereas it ex pressly en joins “One should re main” etc.,
with re spect to the state of child and schol ar ship.
Fur ther schol ar ship re fers to knowl edge. There fore, it in cludes
Muniship which also re fers to knowl edge. As there is no new ness
(Apurva) with re spect to Muniship in the text it has no in junc tive value.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 464
```

This Su tra re futes this view and de clares that Muniship or medi -
ta tive ness is en joined in the text as a third req ui site be sides child-like
state and schol ar ship.
“Muni” means a per son who con stantly med i tates on Brah man.
So con stant med i ta tion is the third aux il iary ob ser vance for one who is
al ready pos sessed of Panditya (er u di tion) and Balya (child-like state);
and as such con stant med i ta tion is en joined to be ob served like the
in junc tions about sac ri fice and con trol of the senses and so on.
This Su tra re fers to a pas sage of the Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad, where in re ply to a ques tion by one Kahola, the sage
Yajnaval kya en joins first, schol arly at tain ments, the child-like sim plic -
ity, and then thirdly, con tin u ous med i ta tion co op er at ing with the two
pre vi ous con di tions, with a view to reali sa tion of Brah man. Though
there is no verb of im per a tive or in junc tive force in the case of this
third state, there is to be in ferred an in junc tion to be un der stood like
the in junc tions in the other cases.
Muniship is con tin u ous con tem pla tion on Brah man. There fore,
it is dif fer ent from schol ar ship. It is a new thing (Apurva). It has not
been re ferred to be fore. Hence the text has in jun c tive value. In ces -
sant med i ta tion is highly ben e fi cial for a Sannyasin who has not yet
at tained one ness or unity of Self and who ex pe ri ences plu ral ity on ac -
count of past ex pres sions or the pre vail ing force of the er ro ne ous idea
of mul ti plic ity.
Munihood is en joined as some thing help ful to knowl edge.

**Kritsnabhavattu grihinopasamharah** III.4.48 (473)

On account of his being all, however, there is winding up with
the householder.

**Kritsnabhavat:** on account of the householder’s life including all; **Tu:**
verily; **Grihina:** by a householder, with the householder;
**Upasamharah:** the conclusion, the goal, salvation, (the Chapter)
ends. ( **Kritsna:** of all (duties); **Bhavat:** owing to the existence;
**Grihinopasamharah:** conclusion with the case of the householder.)

The Sruti winds up with the house holder as he has all the du ties.
He has to do dif fi cult sac ri fices and has also to ob serve Ahim sa,
self-con trol, etc. As the house holder’s life in cludes du ties of all the
other stages of life, the Chap ter ends with the enu mer a tion of the du -
ties of the house holder.
The Chhandogya Upanishad con cludes with the house holder’s
stage, be cause of the fact that this stage in cludes all the oth ers. “He,
the house holder, con duct ing his life in this way, con cen t rat ing all his
senses upon the self, and ab stain ing from in jury to any liv ing be ing
through out his life, at tains the world of Brahma and has not to re turn
again to this world” (Chh. Up. VIII.15.1).

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 465
```

The word ‘tu’ is meant to lay stress on the house holder be ing ev -
ery thing. He has to do many du ties be long ing to his own Asrama
which in volve a great trou ble. At the same time the du ties of the other
Asramas such as ten der ness for all liv ing crea tures, re straint of the
senses and study of scrip tures, and so on are in cum bent on him also
as far as cir cum stances al low. There fore, there is noth ing con tra dic -
tory in the Chhandogya wind ing up with the house holder.
The house holder’s life is very im por tant. Grihasthasrama in -
cludes more or less the du ties of all Asramas. The Sruti enu mer ates
the du ties of the Brahmacharin and then those of the house holder
and there it ends with out re fer ring to Sannyasa in or der to lay stress
on the life of the house holder, to show its im por tance, and not be -
cause it is not one of the pre scribed Asramas.

**_m¡Zd{XVaofm_ß`wnXoemV²Ÿ&**

**Maunavaditareshamapyupadesat** III.4.49 (474)

Because the scripture enjoins the other (stages of life, viz.,
Brahmacharya and Vanaprastha), just as it enjoins the state of
a Muni (Sannyasi).

**Maunavat:** just as silence, like constant meditation, like the state of a
Muni (Sannyasi); **Itaresham:** of the others, of the other orders of life;
**Api:** even, also; **Upadesat:** because of scriptural injunction.

This Su tra states that the scrip ture en joins the ob ser vance of
the du ties of all the or ders of life.
Just as the Sruti en joins Sannyasa and house holder’s life, so
also it en joins the life of a Vanaprastha (her mit) and that of a stu dent
(Brahmacharin). For we have al ready pointed above to pas sages
such as “Aus ter ity is the sec ond, and to dwell as a stu dent in the
house of a teacher is the third.” As thus the four Asramas are equally
taught by the scrip ture, they are to be gone through in se quence or al -
ter nately.
That the Su tra uses a plu ral form (of the ‘oth ers’) when speak ing
of two or ders only, is due to its hav ing re gard ei ther to the dif fer ent
sub-classes of those two or to their dif fi cult du ties.

**Anavishkurvan:** without manifesting himself; **Ananvayat:** according

BRAHMA SUTRAS 466

This Su tra says that the per ver sity of a child is not meant by the
word ‘Balyena’ (by the child-like state), in the pas sage of the
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad quoted un der Su tra 47.
In the pas sage of the Brihadaranyaka quoted in the Su tra 47,
the child-like state is en joined on an as pi rant af ter knowl edge. “There -
fore, a Brahmana af ter he has done with learn ing should re main like a
child.” What is ex actly meant by this?
Does it mean to be like a child with out any idea of pu rity and im -
pu rity, freely at tend ing to the calls of na ture with out any re spect of
place, etc., be hav ing, talk ing and eat ing, ac cord ing to one’s lik ing and
do ing what ever one likes, or does it mean in ward pu rity, i.e., ab sence
of cun ning ness, ar ro gance, sense of ego ism, force of the sen sual
pas sions and so on as in the case of a child?
The pres ent Su tra says it is the lat ter and not the for mer, be -
cause that is det ri men tal to knowl edge. It means that one should be
free from guile, pride, ego ism, etc. He should not man i fest the un de -
sir able evil traits. He should not man i fest by a dis play of knowl edge,
learn ing and vir tu ous ness. Just as a child whose sen sual pow ers
have not yet de vel oped them selves does not at tempt to make a dis -
play of him self be fore oth ers, he must not pub lish and pro claim his
learn ing, wis dom and good ness. Such mean ing only is ap pro pri ate to
the con text, pu rity and in no cence be ing help ful to knowl edge.
Then only the pas sage has a con nec tion with the en tire chap ter
on the ground of co op er at ing to wards the prin ci pal mat ter, namely,
the reali sa tion of Brah man. Be ing free from os ten ta tion is nec es sary,
be cause only then there will be Anvaya or con cor dance of doc trine.
The Smriti writ ers have said, “He whom no body knows ei ther as
no ble or ig no ble, as ig no rant or learned, as well as well-con ducted or
ill-con ducted, he is a Brahmana. Qui etly de voted to his duty, let the
wise man pass through life un known, let him step on this earth as if he
were blind, un con scious, deaf.” An other Smriti pas sage is “With hid -
den na ture, hid den con duct,” and so on.

The time of the origination of knowledge

**Eo{hH$_ß`àñVwVà{V~ÝYo VÔe©ZmV²Ÿ&**

**Aihikamapyaprastutapratibandhe taddarsanat** III.4.51 (476)

In this life (the origination of knowledge takes place) if there be
no obstruction to it (the means adopted), because it is so seen
from the scriptures.

**Aihikam:** in this life; **Api:** even; **Aprastutapratibandhe:** in the
absence of an obstruction to it (the means adopted); **Taddarsanat:**

```
CHAPTER III—SECTION 4 467
```

as it is seen in Sruti. ( **Aprastuta:** not being present; **Pratibandhe:**

obstruction; **Tat:** that; **Darsanat:** being declared by the scriptures.)

This Su tra states whether the con se quence of Brahma Vidya,
which is the reali sa tion of Brah man, is pos si ble in this life or will wait
till death.

Be gin ning from Su tra 26 of the pres ent Pada (Sec tion) we have
dis cussed the var i ous means of knowl edge.
The ques tion now is whether knowl edge that re sults from these
means co mes in this life or in the life to come.

The pres ent Su tra de clares that knowl edge may come in this life
only if there is no ob struc tion to its man i fes ta tion from ex tra ne ous
causes. When the fru ition of knowl edge is about to take place, it is
hin dered by the fruit of some other pow er ful work (Karma), which is
also about to ma ture. When such an ob struc tion takes place, then
knowl edge co mes in the next life.

That is the rea son why the scrip ture also de clares that it is dif fi -
cult to know the Self, “He of whom many are not even able to hear,
whom many even when they hear of him do not com pre hend; won -
der ful is a man when found who is able to teach him; won der ful is he
who com pre hends him when taught by an able teacher” (Katha Up.
I.27).
The Gita also says, “There he re cov ers the char ac ter is tics be -
long ing to his for mer body, and with that he again strives for per fec -
tion, O Joy of the Kurus” (VI.43). “The Yogin striv ing with as si du ity,
pu ri fied from sin, grad u ally gain ing per fec tion, through man i fold
births, then reaches the Su preme Goal” (VI.45).
Fur ther scrip ture re lates that Vamadeva al ready be came Brah -
man in his mother’s womb and thus shows that knowl edge may
spring up in a later form of ex is tence through means pro cured in a for -
mer one; be cause a child in a womb can not pos si bly pro cure such
means in its pres ent state.
It, there fore, is an es tab lished con clu sion that knowl edge orig i -
nates ei ther in the pres ent or in a fu ture life, in de pend ence on the ev -
a nes cence of ob sta cles.

**Evam muktiphalaniyamastadavasthavadhrites-
tadavasthavadhriteh** III.4.52 (477)

No such definite rule exists with respect to emancipation, the
fruit (of knowledge), because the Sruti asserts that state (to be
immutable).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 468
```

**Evam:** thus, like this; **Muktiphalaniyamah:** there is no rule with
respect to the final emancipation, the fruit (of knowledge);
**Tadavasthavadhriteh:** on account of the assertions by the Sruti as to
that condition. ( **Mukti:** salvation; Phala: fruit; **Aniyamah:** there is no
rule; **Tat:** that; **Avastha:** condition; **Avadhriteh:** because the Sruti
has ascertained so.)

In the pre vi ous Su tra it was seen that knowl edge may re sult in
this life or the next ac cord ing to the ab sence or pres ence of ob struc -
tions and the in ten sity of the means adopted.
Sim i larly a doubt may arise that there may be some rule with re -
spect to the fi nal eman ci pa tion also, which is the fruit of knowl edge. A
doubt may arise whether sal va tion can be de layed af ter knowl edge,
and whether there are de grees of knowl edge ac cord ing to the qual i fi -
ca tion of the as pi rant, whether there ex ists a sim i lar def i nite dif fer -
ence with re gard to the fruit char ac ter ised as fi nal re lease, ow ing to
the su pe rior or in fe rior qual i fi ca tion of the per sons know ing.
This Su tra de clares that no such rule ex ists with re gard to re -
lease. Be cause all Vedanta texts as sert the state of fi nal re lease to be
of one kind only. The state of fi nal re lease is noth ing but Brah man and
Brah man can not be con nected with dif fer ent forms since many scrip -
tural pas sages as sert it to have one na ture only.
“The knower of Brah man be comes Brah man.” There can be no
va ri ety in it, as Brah man is with out qual i ties.
There is no such di ver gence in the fruit of Mukti, be cause of the
af fir ma tion of its iden ti cal na ture. There may be dif fer ences in the po -
tency of the Sadhana lead ing to knowl edge or Brahma Vidya. Brahma
Vidya it self is of the same na ture, though it may come early or late ow -
ing to the power of the Sadhana. There is no dif fer ence in the na ture
of Mukti (lib er a tion) which is at tained by Brahma Vidya. There would
be dif fer ence of re sults in Kar mas and Upasanas (Saguna Vidyas)
but Nirguna Vidya is but one and its re sult viz., Mukti is iden ti cal in all
cases.
Dif fer ence is pos si ble only when there are qual i ties as in the
case of the Saguna Brah man. There may be dif fer ence in the ex pe ri -
ences ac cord ing to dif fer ence in Vidyas but with re gard to Nirguna
Brah man it can be one only and not many.

through knowl edge.
Knowl edge can not ad mit of lower or higher de gree be cause it is

There can not be any de lay in the at tain ment of eman ci pa tion af -

In the Third Chap ter, the Sadhanas or the means of knowl edge
re lat ing to Para Vidya (higher knowl edge) and Apara Vidya (lower
knowl edge) were dis cussed. The Fourth Chap ter treats of Phala or
the Su preme Bliss of at tain ment of Brah man. Other top ics also are
dealt with in it. In the be gin ning, how ever, a sep a rate dis cus sion con -
cerned with the means of knowl edge is dealt with in a few
Adhikaranas. The re main der of the pre vi ous dis cus sion about
Sadhanas is con tin ued in the be gin ning. As the main topic of this
Chap ter is that of the re sults or fruits of Brahma Vidya, it is called
Phala Adhyaya.

**SYNOPSIS**
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-2) The med i ta tion on the At man en -
joined by scrip ture is not an act to be ac com plished once only, but is
to be re peated again and again till knowl edge is at tained.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Su tra 3) The meditator en gaged in med i ta tion on
Brah man is to view or com pre hend It as iden ti cal with his own self.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Su tra 4) In Pratikopasanas where sym bols of
Brah man are used for med i ta tion as for in stance “ _Mano
Brahmetyupasita_ ”, the meditator is not to con sider the Pratika or sym -
bol as iden ti cal with him.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Su tra 5) In the Pratikopasanas, the Pratikas or
sym bols are to be viewed as Brah man and not in the re verse way.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Su tra 6) In med i ta tions on the mem bers of sac ri -
fi cial acts, the idea of di vin ity is to be su per im posed on the mem bers
and not _vice versa_. In the ex am ple quoted for in stance the Udgitha is
to be viewed as Aditya, not Aditya as the Udgitha.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 7-10) One is to carry on his med i ta tions
in a sit ting pos ture. Sri Sankara main tains that the rule does not ap ply
to those med i ta tions whose re sult is Samyag-darsana but the Su tra
gives no hint to that ef fect.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Su tra 11) The med i ta tions may be car ried on at
any time, and in any place, if fa vour able to con cen tra tion of mind.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Su tra 12) The med i ta tions are to be con tin ued
un til death. Sri Sankara again holds that those med i ta tions which lead
to Samyag-darsana are ex cepted.
_Adhikarana IX:_ (Su tra 13) Knowl edge of Brah man frees one
from the ef fects of all past and fu ture evil deeds.
_Adhikarana X:_ (Su tra 14) Good deeds like wise cease to af fect
the knower of Brah man.
_Adhikarana XI:_ (Su tra 15) Works which have not be gun to yield
re sults (Anarabdhakarya) are alone de stroyed by knowl edge and not
those which have al ready be gun to yield fruits (Arabdhakarya).
_Adhikarana XII:_ (Sutras 16-17) From the rule enun ci ated in
Adhikarana X are ex cepted such sac ri fi cial per for mances as are en -
joined per ma nently (Nitya, oblig a tory works), as for in stance the
Agnihotra, be cause they pro mote the orig i na tion of knowl edge.
_Adhikarana XIII:_ (Su tra 18) Sac ri fi cial works not com bined with
knowl edge or med i ta tions also help in the orig i na tion of knowl edge.
_Adhikarana XIV:_ (Su tra 19) On the ex haus tion of Prarabdha
work through en joy ment, the knower of Brah man at tains one ness
with It. The Bhoga or en joy ment of the Su tra is, ac cord ing to Sankara,

re stricted to the pres ent ex is tence of the seeker, since the com plete
knowl edge ob tained by him de stroys the ig no rance which oth er wise
would lead to fu ture em bodi ments.

Avrittyadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-2)
Meditation on Brahman should be continued
till knowledge is attained
```
**Amd¥{ÎmagH¥$XwnXoemV² Ÿ&**

**Avrittirasakridupadesat** IV.1.1 (478)

The repetition (of hearing, reflection and meditation on
Brahman is necessary) on account of the repeated instruction
by the scriptures.

**Avrittih:** repetition, practice of meditation on Brahman (is
necessary); **Asakrit:** not only once, many times, repeatedly;
**Upadesat:** because of instruction by the scriptures.

This Su tra states that con stant prac tice of med i ta tion is nec es -
sary.
Fre quent prac tice of med i ta tion on Brah man is nec es sary as
there is in struc tion to that ef fect in the Sruti.
“Ver ily, the Self is to be seen, to be re flected upon, and med i -
tated upon” (Bri. Up. II.4.5). “The in tel li gent as pi rant know ing about
Brah man should at tain Brahma-Sakshatkara or di rect Self-reali sa -
tion” (Bri. Up. IV.4.21). “That is what we must search out, that is what
we must try to un der stand” (Chh. Up. VIII.7.1).
A doubt arises whether the men tal ac tion (re flec tion and med i ta -
tion) re ferred to in them is to be pre formed once only or re peat edly.
The Purvapakshin main tains that it is to be ob served once only
as in the case of Prayaja of fer ings and the like.
“Let us then re peat ex actly as the scrip ture says, i.e., let us hear
the self once, let us re flect on it once, let us med i tate on it once and
noth ing more”.
The pres ent Su tra re futes this view and says that hear ing, etc.,
must be re peated till one at tains knowl edge of Brah man or di rect
Self-reali sa tion, just as paddy is husked till we get rice. There is the
ne ces sity of rep e ti tion till there is dawn of knowl edge of Brah man.
The rep e ti tion of men tal acts of re flec tion and med i ta tion even tu ally
leads to di rect Self-reali sa tion. Rep e ti tion is to be per formed be cause
scrip ture gives re peated in struc tion.
Thus in the Chh. Up. VI.8.7 the teacher re peats nine times the
say ing, _“Tat Satyam Sa Atma Tat-Tvam-Asi Svetaketo_ —That Truth,
That At man, That thou art, O Svetaketu!” Here Svetaketu is taught the
mys tery about Brah man nine times be fore he un der stood it.
The anal ogy of the Prayaja is faulty. It is not to the point at all be -
cause there is the Adrishta which is the re sult gives fruit at some par -
tic u lar fu ture time in the next world. But here the re sult is di rectly
real ised. Di rect in tu ition of the Self is a vis i ble re sult to be gained in
this very life. There fore, if the re sult is not there, the pro cess must be

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 474
```

re peated, till the re sult is real ised. Such acts must be re peated, be -
cause they sub serve a seen pur pose.
When we speak of the Upasana of the Guru or the king or of the
wife think ing about her ab sent hus band, we do not mean a sin gle act
of ser vice or thought but a con tin u ous se ries of acts and thoughts. We
say in or di nary life that a per son is de voted to a teacher or a king if he
fol lows him with a mind steadily set on him, and of a wife whose hus -
band has gone on a jour ney we say that she thinks of him only if she
steadily re mem bers him with long ing.
In Vedanta, Vid (know ing) and Upasati (med i tat ing) are used as
iden ti cal. That ‘know ing’ im plies rep e ti tion fol lows from the fact that in
the Vedanta texts the terms ‘know ing’ and ‘med i tat ing’ are seen to be
used one in the place of the other. In some pas sages the term ‘know -
ing’ is used in the be gin ning and the term ‘med i tat ing’ in the end: thus,
e.g., “He who knows what he knows is thus spo ken of by me” and
“teach me sir, the de ity which you med i tate on” (Chh. Up. IV.1.4; 2.2).
In other places the text at first speaks of ‘med i tat ing’ and later on of
‘know ing’; thus e.g., “Let a man med i tate on mind as Brah man” and
“He who knows this shines and warms through his ce leb rity, fame and
glory of coun te nance” (Chh. Up. III.18.1, 6).
Med i ta tion and re flec tion im ply a rep e ti tion of the men tal act.
When we say “He med i tates on it” the con ti nu ity of the act of re mem -
brance of the ob ject is im plied. Sim i lar is the case with re flec tion also.
From this it fol lows that rep e ti tion has to be prac tised there also,
where the text gives in struc tion once only. Where, again, the text
gives re peated in struc tion, re peated per for mance of the men tal acts
is di rectly in ti mated.
When the scrip ture speak ing about the rice for the sac ri fice
says, “The rice should be beaten” the sac ri ficer un der stands that the
in junc tion means “The rice should be beaten over and over again, till
it is free from husk” for no sac ri fice can be per formed with the rice with
its husk on. So when the scrip ture says, “The Self must be seen
through hear ing, re flec tion and med i ta tion” it means the rep e ti tion of
these men tal pro cesses, so long as the Self is not seen or real ised.

**{b“mƒŸ&**

**Lingaccha** IV.1.2 (479)

And on account of the indicatory mark.

**Lingat:** because of the indicatory mark or sign; **Cha:** and.

The same topic is con tin ued.
An indicatory mark also shows that rep e ti tion is re quired. In the
Sruti there is a teach ing of re peated med i ta tion. It says that one son
will be born if there is a sin gle act of med i ta tion whereas many sons
will be born if there are many and re peated acts of med i ta tion. “Re -

flect upon the rays and you will have many sons” (Chh. Up. I.5.2). In
the Sec tion treat ing of med i ta tion on the Udgitha the text re peats the
med i ta tion on the Udgitha viewed as the sun, be cause its re sult is one
son only and the clause “Re flect upon his rays” en joins a med i ta tion
on his man i fold rays as lead ing to the pos ses sion of many sons. This
in di cates that the rep e ti tion of med i ta tion is some thing well known.
What holds good in this case holds good for other med i ta tions also.
In the case of first class type of as pi rant with in tense pu rity,
dispassion, dis crim i na tion and ex tremely sub tle and sharp in tel lect, a
sin gle hear ing of that great sen tence “ _Tat-Tvam-Asi_ ” Mahavakya will
be quite suf fi cient. Rep e ti tion would in deed be use less for him who is
able to real ise the true na ture of Brah man even if the Mahavakya
“ _Tat-Tvam-Asi_ ” is enounced once only. But such ad vanced souls are
very rare. Or di nary peo ple who are deeply at tached to the body and
ob jects can not at tain reali sa tion of Truth by a sin gle enun ci a tion of it.
For such per sons rep e ti tion is of use. The er ro ne ous no tion “I am the
body” can be de stroyed only through con stant med i ta tion or re peated
prac tice. Knowl edge can dawn only when there is in ces sant and fre -
quent med i ta tion.
Rep e ti tion has the power of an ni hi lat ing this er ro ne ous idea
grad u ally. Med i ta tion should be con tin ued till the last trace of body
idea is de stroyed. When the body con scious ness is to tally an ni hi -
lated, Brah man shines It self in all Its pris tine glory and pu rity. The
meditator and the med i tated be come one. In di vid u al ity van ishes in
toto.
If rep e ti tion is not nec es sary, the Chhandogya Upanishad would
not have taught the truth of the great sen tence “Thou art That” re peat -
edly.
In the Taittiriya Upanishad III.2 we find that Bhrigu goes sev eral
times to his fa ther Varuna and asks him again and again, to be taught
the na ture of Brah man.
Bhrigu Varuni went to his fa ther Varuna say ing, “Sir, teach me
Brah man.” He told him this, viz., food, breath, the eye, the ear, mind
and speech. Then he said again to him “That from whence these be -
ings are born, that by which when born they live, that into which they
en ter at their death, try to know that. That is Brah man.”
This in junc tion about rep e ti tion is meant for those only who lack
in pu rity and sub tle un der stand ing and in whom a sin gle enun ci a tion
is not suf fi cient to give them the di rect cog ni tion of Brah man.
The in di vid ual soul is taught step by step to be sub tler than the
body, etc., till it is real ised as pure Chaitanya. When we have the
knowl edge of the ob ject only, we can have full knowl edge of the af fir -
ma tion about it. In the case of those who have ig no rance or doubt or
wrong knowl edge, the af fir ma tion ( _Tat-Tvam-Asi_ ) can not bring on im -
me di ate reali sa tion but to those who have no such ob struc tion there

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 476
```

will be reali sa tion. Hence re it er a tion with rea son ing is only for lead ing
us to full Vachyartha Jnana.
We ob serve that men by re peat ing again and again a sen tence
which they, on the first hear ing, had un der stood im per fectly only,
grad u ally rid them selves of all mis con cep tions and ar rive at a full un -
der stand ing of the true sense.
All this es tab lishes the con clu sion that, in the case of cog ni tion
of the Su preme Brah man, the in struc tion lead ing to such reali sa tion
may be re peated.

Atmatvopasanadhikaranam: Topic 2
He who meditates on the Supreme Brahman
must comprehend It as identical with himself

**Atmeti tupagacchanti grahayanti cha** IV.1.3 (480)

But (the Sruti texts) acknowledge (Brahman) as the Self (of the
meditator) and also teach other (to realise It as such).

**Atmeti:** as the Self; **Tu:** but; **Upagacchanti:** acknowledge, approach,
realise; **Grahayanti:** teach, make others comprehend, instruct; **Cha:**
also.

This Su tra pre scribes the pro cess of med i ta tion.
A doubt arises whether Brah man is to be com pre hended by the
Jiva or the in di vid ual soul as iden ti cal with it or sep a rate from it.
The op po nent main tains that Brah man is to be com pre hended
as dif fer ent from the in di vid ual soul ow ing to their es sen tial dif fer ence,
be cause the in di vid ual soul is sub ject to pain, sor row and mis ery,
while the other is not.
The pres ent Su tra re futes the view that Brah man is to be com -
pre hended as iden ti cal with one’s self. The in di vid ual is es sen tially
Brah man only. The Jivahood is due to the lim it ing ad junct, the in ter nal
or gan or Antahkarana. The Jivahood is il lu sory. The Jiva is in re al ity
an em bodi ment of bliss. It ex pe ri ences pain and mis ery on ac count of
the lim it ing ad junct, Antahkarana.
The Jabalas ac knowl edge it “I am in deed Thou, O Lord, and
Thou art in deed my self.” Other scrip tural texts also say the same
thing, “I am Brah man: _Aham Brahma Asmi_ ” (Bri. Up. I.4.10). “Thy self
is this which is within all” (Bri. Up. III.4.1). “He is thy self, the ruler
within, the im mor tal” (Bri. Up. III.7.3). “That is the True, that is the Self,
That thou art” (Chh. Up. VI.8.7). The texts are to be taken in their pri -
mary and not sec ond ary sense as in “The mind is Brah man” (Chh.
Up. III.18.1), where the text pres ents the mind as a sym bol for med i ta -
tion.
There fore we have to med i tate on Brah man as the Self.

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 1 477
```

You can not say that these mean only a feel ing or emo tion of
one ness, just as we re gard an idol as Vishnu.
In the lat ter case we have only a sin gle state ment. But in the
Jabala Sruti we have a dou ble af fir ma tion, i.e., the iden tity of Brah -
man with the in di vid ual soul with Brah man. The seem ing dif fer ence
be tween Jiva and Brah man is un real. There is Jivahood or
Samsaritva for the in di vid ual soul till reali sa tion is at tained.
Hence we must fix our minds on Brah man as be ing the Self.

```
Pratikadhikaranam: Topic 3
The symbols of Brahman should not be meditated upon
as identical with the meditator
```
**Z àVrHo$ Z {h g...Ÿ&**

**Na pratike na hi sah** IV.1.4 (481)
(The meditator is) not (to see the Self) in the symbol, because
he is not (that).

**Na:** not; **Pratike:** in the symbol (such as Akasa, the sun, the mind,
etc.); **Na:** not; **Hi:** because; **Sah:** he.

This and the fol low ing two Sutras ex am ine the value of a Pratika
or sym bol in wor ship.
Pratikas, sym bols, would not be re garded as one with us. The
meditator can not re gard them as be ing one with him, as they are sep -
a rate from him.
Chhandogya Upanishad III.18.1 de clares “The mind is Brah -
man”.
A doubt arises whether in such med i ta tions where the mind is
taken as a sym bol of Brah man, the meditator is to iden tify him self with
the mind, as in the case of the med i ta tion: “I am Brah man— _Aham
Brahma Asmi”._
The Purvapakshin main tains that he should, be cause the mind
is a prod uct of Brah man and as such it is one with It. So the meditator,
the in di vid ual soul, is one with Brah man. There fore, it fol lows that the
meditator also is one with the mind, and hence he should see his Self
in the mind in this med i ta tion also.
The pres ent Su tra re futes this. We must not at tach to sym bols
the idea of Brah man. Be cause the meditator can not com pre hend the
het er o ge neous sym bols as be ing of the na ture of the Self.
We must not re gard Pratikas (sym bols or im ages) as be ing our -
selves. They are dif fer ent from our selves and can not be re garded as
be ing iden ti cal with our selves. Nor can we say that they be ing de riv a -
tives of Brah man and Brah man be ing one with At man, they are also
to be treated as one with the At man. They can be one with Brah man
only if they go above name and form and when they go above name
and form, they will not be Pratikas.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 478
```

At man is Brah man only when freed from Kartritva (doership).
Two gold or na ments can not be iden ti cal but both can be one with
gold.
If the sym bol mind is real ised as iden ti cal with Brah man, then it
is no lon ger a sym bol, just as when we real ise an or na ment as gold, it
ceases to be an or na ment. If the med i tat ing per son real ises his iden -
tity with Brah man, then he is no lon ger the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul,
the meditator. The dis tinc tions of meditator, med i ta tion and the med i -
tated ex ist in the be gin ning when one ness has not been real ised.
When ever there is the dis tinc tion be tween the meditator and the med -
i tated there is the pro cess of med i ta tion. Where there is con scious -
ness of dif fer ence, di ver sity or plu ral ity, the meditator is quite dis tinct
from the sym bol.
For these rea sons the self is not med i tated in sym bols. The
meditator is not to see his self in the sym bol.

```
Brahmadrishtyadhikaranam: Topic 4
When meditating on a symbol, the symbol should be considered
as Brahman and not Brahman as the symbol
```
**~«÷Ñ{ï>éËH$fm©V² Ÿ&**

**Brahmadrishtirutkarshat** IV.1.5 (482)

(The symbol) is to be viewed as Brahman (and not in the
reverse way), on account of the exaltation (of the symbol
thereby).

**Brahmadrishtih:** the view of Brahman, the view in the light of
Brahman; **Utkarshat:** on account of superiority, because of
super-eminence.

The same dis cus sion is con tin ued.
In med i ta tions on sym bols as in “The mind is Brah man”, “The
sun is Brah man”, the ques tion is whether the sym bol is to be con sid -
ered as Brah man, or Brah man as the sym bol.
This Su tra de clares that the sym bols, the mind, the sun, etc., are
to be re garded as Brah man and not in the re verse way. Be cause you
can at tain el e va tion or prog ress by look ing upon an in fe rior thing as a
su pe rior thing and not in the re verse way. As you have to be hold
Brah man in ev ery thing and free your self from the idea of dif fer en ti a -
tion and di ver sity, you have to con tem plate on these sym bols as
Brah man.
To view the sym bol as Brah man is quite proper, but by re vers ing
the or der to view Brah man in the light of the sym bol is not jus ti fi able,
be cause of super-em i nence of Brah man over the sym bol.
It would not serve any pur pose to think of Brah man in the light of
a lim ited thing; be cause it would be only to de grade the In fi nite Lord to
the sta tus of a fi nite thing. The sym bol should be raised higher in

down to the level of the sym bol.

Adityadimatyadhikaranam: Topic 5
In meditation on the members of sacrificial acts the idea of divinity
is to be superimposed on the members and not in the reverse way.
```
**Am{XË`m{X_V`üm“ CnnÎmo...Ÿ&**

**Adityadimatayaschanga upapatteh** IV.1.6 (483)

And the ideas of the sun, etc., are to be superimposed) on the
subordinate members (of sacrificial acts), because (in that way
alone the statement of the scriptures would be) consistent.

**Adityadimatayah:** the idea of the sun, etc.; **Cha:** and; **Anga:** in a
subordinate member (of the sacrificial acts); **Upapatteh:** because of
consistency, because of its reasonableness.

A par tic u lar in stance is cited to con firm the pre ced ing Su tra.
“He who burns up these (sun), let a man med i tate upon that
which shines yon der as the Udgitha” (Chh. Up. I.3.1). “One ought to
med i tate upon the Saman as five fold” (Chh. Up. II.2.1). “Let a man
med i tate on the seven fold Saman in speech” (Chh. Up. II.8.1). “This
earth is the Rik, fire is Saman” (Chh. Up. I.6.1).
In med i ta tions con nected with sac ri fi cial acts as given in the
texts quoted, how is the med i ta tion to be per formed? Is the sun to be
viewed as the Udgitha or the Udgitha as the sun? Be tween the
Udgitha and the sun there is noth ing to in di cate which is su pe rior, as
in the pre vi ous Su tra, where Brah man be ing pre-em i nent, the sym bol
was viewed as Brah man.
The pres ent Su tra de clares that the mem bers of sac ri fi cial acts
as the Udgitha are to be viewed as the sun and so on, for the fruit of
the sac ri fi cial act is in creased by so do ing. The sac ri fi cial work be -
comes suc cess ful. A scrip tural pas sage, viz., Chh. Up. I.1.10 “What -
ever one per forms with knowl edge, faith and Upanishad is more
pow er ful” ex pressly de clares that knowl edge causes the suc cess of
sac ri fi cial work.
If we view the Udgitha as the sun, it un der goes a cer tain cer e -
mo nial pu ri fi ca tion and thereby con trib utes to the Apurva or Adrishta,
the in vis i ble fruit of the whole sac ri fice, which leads to Karma
Samriddhi (the fulness of the Karma). If the sun is viewed as Udgitha
in the re verse way the pu ri fi ca tion of the sun by this med i ta tion will not
con trib ute to the Apurva, as the sun is not a mem ber of the sac ri fi cial
act.
The mem bers of the sac ri fi cial acts are to be viewed as the sun,
etc., if the dec la ra tion of the scrip tures that the med i ta tions in crease
the re sult of the sac ri fice is to come true.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 480
```

The sun, etc., are higher (Utkarsha) than Udgitha be cause the
sun, etc., are the fruits at tained by Karma. There fore, the rule of
Utkarsha-buddhi re ferred to above needs that we must re gard and
wor ship Udgitha, etc., as the sun, etc.
If you say that if we re gard the sun, etc., as the Udgitha, the for -
mer be ing of the na ture of Karma will give the fruit, that would be
wrong be cause Upasana it self is a Karma and will give the fruit.
The Udgitha should be raised higher in thought to the level of
the sun, but not the sun brought down to that of the Udgitha.
In this way a meditator should raise him self to the level of Brah -
man by think ing him self as Brah man, but should not bring Brah man
down to the level of the in di vid ual soul.

One is to meditate sitting.

**Asinah sambhavat** IV.1.7 (484)

Sitting (a man is to meditate) on account of the possibility.

**Asinah:** sitting; **Sambhavat:** on account of the possibility.

The pos ture of the meditator while en gaged in med i ta tion is now
dis cussed.
In Karmanga Upasanas there is no ques tion as to whether they
should be done sit ting or stand ing as they de pend on the par tic u lar

ques tion as it de pends on the ob ject of reali sa tion. In other Upasanas
sit ting is nec es sary for med i ta tion.
The Purvapakshin here main tains that as the med i ta tion is

This Su tra says that one has to med i tate sit ting, be cause it is not

for med i ta tion be cause Upasana is the con ti nu ity of men tal state and
such con ti nu ity will not ex ist when one walks or runs be cause then the
mind will at tend to the body and can not con cen trate, or when one lies

In Upasana one has to con cen trate one’s mind on a sin gle ob -

And on account of meditation.

**Dhyanat:** on account of meditation; **Cha:** and.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 7 is ad duced.
Fur ther, such con ti nu ity of thought is Dhy ana or med i ta tion. It
can come only when the limbs are not ac tive and the mind is calm.
Upasana (wor ship) be ing mainly of the na ture of con cen tra tion,
should be prac tised in a sit ting pos ture, which is con du cive to con cen -

tra tion. Con cen tra tion be ing an un in ter rupted and unintermittent cur -
rent of thought sent to wards a par tic u lar ob ject, the sit ting pos ture
be comes in dis pens able.
The word ‘Upasana’ also de notes ex actly what med i ta tion
means, that is con cen trat ing on a sin gle ob ject with a fixed look, and

with out any move ment of the limbs. This is pos si ble only in a sit ting
pos ture.
Med i ta tion de notes a length ened car ry ing of the same train of
ideas. We as cribe thought ful ness to those whose mind is con cen -

trated on one and the same ob ject while their look is fixed and their
limbs do not move. We say that Sri Ramakrishna is thought ful. Now
such thought ful ness is easy for those who sit. The wife sits and thinks
deeply over her hus band gone on a dis tant jour ney.
Dhy ana or med i ta tion is think ing on one sub ject con tin u ously,

with out the in rush of ideas in con gru ous with the sub ject of thought.
Such med i ta tion is pos si ble in a sit ting pos ture only and not while ly -

adopted both for prayers as well as for med i ta tion.
The dis trac tion of mind is mini mised when one med i tates in a

BRAHMA SUTRAS 482

The word ‘cha’ has the force of ‘in deed’. In the Chhandogya
Upanishad the root ‘Dhy ana’ or med i ta tion is em ployed in the sense
of mo tion less ness.
With ref er ence to the im mo bil ity of the earth in or di nary eye, the
scrip ture fan cies the earth as be ing en gaged in con cen tra tion, as if it
re mains fixed in space in the act of pi ous med i ta tion. It sug gests that
such a steady ap pli ca tion of the mind can be at tained by med i tat ing

only in a sit ting pos ture.
If the body is at rest, there is rest for the mind also; if the body is
in mo tion, i.e., rest less, the mind too be comes rest less.
In the pas sage, “The earth med i tates as it were”, medi ta tive -
ness is at trib uted to earth on ac count of its im mo bil ity or steadi ness.
This also helps us to in fer that med i ta tion is pos si ble in one when he is
sit ting and not while stand ing or walk ing.
Steadi ness ac com pa nies med i ta tion. Steadi ness of body and

**Aa prayanat:** till death, till Mukti; **Tatra:** there, then; **Api:** also, even;
**Hi:** because; **Drishtam:** is seen (in the Sruti).

This Su tra says Upasana (med i ta tion, wor ship) is to be ob -

Wor ship is to be con tin ued till death, till one gets Mukti, be cause
it is found in Sruti, that the wor ship per, con tin u ing so till death, at tains
the world of Brah man af ter death.
The first topic of the pres ent Chap ter has es tab lished that the

The ques tion is now taken up about other med i ta tions which are

The Purvapakshin main tains that such med i ta tions can be
stopped af ter a cer tain time. They should still give fruits like sac ri fices

The pres ent Su tra de clares that they are to be con tin ued up to
death, be cause the Sruti and Smriti say so. “With what ever thought
he passes away from this world” (Sat. Br. X.6.3.1). “Re mem ber ing
what ever form of be ing he in the end leaves this body, into that same
form he even passes, as sim i lated its be ing” (Bhagavad Gita VIII.6).
“At the time of death with un moved mind” (Bhagavad Gita VIII.10).
“Let a man at the time of death, take ref uge with this triad” (Chh. Up.

**Tadadhigama:** when that is realised; **Uttarapurvaghayoh:** of the

The re sult of knowl edge of Brah man or the state of Jivanmukti is
now dis cussed.
The sup ple ment to the Third Chap ter is fin ished here with. With
the last Adhikarana the top ics con nected with the Third Chap ter have
come to an end. From this Adhikarana the Fourth Chap ter proper be -
gins. The Fourth Chap ter is the Phaladhyaya, i.e., the Chap ter re lat -
ing to the fruits of Brahma Vidya.
The Purvapakshin main tains that eman ci pa tion is at tained in
spite of knowl edge, only af ter one has ex pe ri enced ef fects of one’s
sins com mit ted be fore en light en ment be cause the Smritis de clare
“Karma is not de stroyed be fore it has yielded its ef fects.” The law of
Karma is un re lent ing.
This Su tra says that when a per son at tains knowl edge all his
past sins are de stroyed and fu ture sins do not cling to him.
Karma has doubt less its power of bring ing its ef fects but that
power can be nul li fied and over come by knowl edge of Brah man.
Prayaschittas (ex pi a tory acts) have the power of cleans ing sin.
Saguna-Brahma-Vidya cleanses all sins. Nirguna-Brahma-Vidya
puts an end to agency or doership and de stroys all sins. Hence no fu -
ture doership can come to him and the ef fects of the en tire past
doership van ish when knowl edge dawns. Oth er wise there will be no
lib er a tion as Karma is Anadi (beginningless). If it is said that eman ci -
pa tion is caused like the fruits of Karma, it will be tran sient and not
eter nal.
Fur ther, the re sults of Jnana must be di rect and im me di ate. So
all sins van ish when one at tains knowl edge of Brah man or Self-reali -
sa tion.
The scrip ture de clares that fu ture sins which might be pre -
sumed to cling to the agent do not cling to him who knows. “As wa ter

does not cling to lo tus leaf, so no evil deed clings to him who knows
this” (Chh. Up. IV.14.3). Sim i larly scrip ture de clares the de struc tion of
pre vi ous ac cu mu lated evil deeds. “As the fibres of the Ishika reed
when thrown into the fire are burnt, thus all sins are burnt” (Chh. Up.
V.24.3). The ex tinc tion of works the fol low ing pas sage also de clares:
“The fet ter of the heart is bro ken, all doubts are solved, all his works
are de stroyed when He who is high and low is seen” (Mun. Up. II.2.8).
As re gards the verses which say that no Karma is de stroyed,
but by pro duc ing its ef fects, that holds good in the case of or di nary
men who are in ig no rance and who have no knowl edge of Brah man. It
does not hold good in the case of those en light ened sages who have
knowl edge of Brah man.
The knower of Brah man feels and real ises thus: “That Brah man
whose na ture it is to be at all times nei ther agent not enjoyer, and
which is thus op posed in be ing to the soul’s pre vi ously es tab lished
state of agency and en joy ment that Brah man am I; hence I nei ther
was an agent, nor an enjoyer at any pre vi ous time, nor am I such at
the pres ent time, nor shall I be such at any fu ture time.”
In this way only the fi nal eman ci pa tion is pos si ble; for oth er wise,
i.e., if the chain of works which has been run ning on from eter nity
could not be cut short, lib er a tion could never take place. Eman ci pa -
tion can not de pend on lo cal ity, time and spe cial causes, as the fruit of
works is; be cause there from it would fol low that the fruit of knowl edge
is non-per ma nent.
There fore, it is an es tab lished con clu sion that there re sults the
ex tinc tion of all sins on at tain ing Brah man.

Thus in the same way, there is non-clinging of the other (i.e.,

Videha-Mukti is certain).

**Itarasya:** of the other; **Api:** also; **Evam:** thus, in the same way;
**Asamsleshah:** non-clinging; **Pate:** at death; **Tu:** but, indeed.

Dis cus sion on the con se quence of Brahma Jnana (the knowl -
edge of Brah man) is con tin ued.
As in the case of sin, so merit or vir tue can not at tach to the
knower of Brah man. Oth er wise such merit will be an ob struc tion to
lib er a tion. When doership goes, merit must go like sin. The re sult of
merit is be low that of Jnana. Merit and sin have to be left be hind.
When both are tran scended, lib er a tion is sure at death.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 486
```

A knower of Brah man has no idea of agency. He is not touched
by good works also. He goes be yond vir tue and vice. “He over comes
both” (Bri. Up. IV.4.22).
Even there where the text men tions evil deeds only, we must
con sider good deeds also to be im plied therein, be cause the re sults
of the lat ter also are in fe rior to the re sults of knowl edge.
Merit also is a cause of bond age and stands in the way of lib er a -
tion. For a knower of Brah man all his ac cu mu lated mer its and de mer -

**Anarabdhakarye eva tu purve tadavadheh** IV.1.15 (492)

But only those former (works) whose effects have not yet begun
(are destroyed by knowledge; because the scripture states)
that (i.e., the death of the body) to be the term.

**Anarabdhakarye:** in the case of those works, the effects of which
have not begun to operate, i.e., to yield fruits or results; **Eva:** only; **Tu:**
but; **Purve:** former works; **Tadavadheh:** that (death) being the limit,
because of waiting till death.

Dis cus sion on the con se quence of Brahma Jnana is con tin ued.
In the last two Adhikaranas (top ics) it has been stated that all the
past works of a knower of Brah man are de stroyed. Past works are of
two kinds, viz., Sanchita (ac cu mu lated works) those which have not
yet be gun to yield re sults and Prarabdha, i.e., those works whose ef -
fects have al ready be gun to op er ate and have pro duced the body
through which the as pi rant has at tained Brahma Jnana or knowl edge
of Brah man.
The Purvapakshin main tains that both these are de stroyed, be -
cause the Mundaka Upanishad says that all his works are de stroyed.
“He thereby over comes both”. This re fers to all works with out any dis -
tinc tion, all works what ever must be re garded to un dergo de struc tion.
Fur ther the sage who has at tained Self-reali sa tion is a
non-doer. He has no idea or feel ing of agency. His idea of
non-doership is the same with ref er ence to Sanchita or Prarabdha.
Hence both these works are de stroyed when one at tains knowl edge
of Brah man or the Su preme Self.
This Su tra re futes this view and de clares that only Sanchita Kar -
mas or ac cu mu lated works whose fruits have not yet be gun to op er -
ate are de stroyed by knowl edge but not the Prarabdha. Prarabdha
Kar mas are de stroyed only by be ing worked out. Those works whose

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 1 487
```

ef fects have be gun and whose re sults have been half en joyed, i.e.,
those very works to which there is due the pres ent state of ex is tence
in which the knowl edge of Brah man arises and not de stroyed by that
knowl edge. This view is founded on the scrip tural pas sage “For him
there is de lay only as long as he is not de liv ered from this body, and
then he is one with Brah man” (Chh. Up. VI.14.2), which fixes the
death of the body as the term of the state ment of the at tain ment of fi -
nal re lease.
If it were not so, then there would be no teach ers of knowl edge.
There fore, the Prarabdha Kar mas are not de stroyed by knowl -
edge.
If it is said that fire must de stroy all seeds, the re ply is that what
has be gun to op er ate, like a pot ter’s wheel, must have its op er a tion.
Mithya Jnana (the er ro ne ous knowl edge of mul ti plic ity) though ne -
gated by Jnana, will per sist for a while (Badhitanuvritti).
Each man’s in ner reali sa tion can not be de nied or dis puted by
an other. This truth is de clared by the de scrip tion of the Sthitaprajna in
the Bhagavad Gita.
The Knowl edge of Brah man in a knower or a sage can not check
the Prarabdha Karma, just as an ar cher has no con trol over the ar -
rows al ready dis charged, which co mes to rest only when its mo men -
tum is ex hausted. The lib er ated sage must keep up this body as long
as the mo men tum of Prarabdha Kar mas lasts. When the Prarabdha
Kar mas are worked out or ex hausted the body falls off and he at tains
Videha-Mukti or dis em bod ied sal va tion.
The fi nal dis cus sion, there fore, is that knowl edge ef fects the de -
struc tion of those works only whether good or evil, whose ef fects
have not yet be gun to op er ate.

ish ing state of the body, if the curd is mixed with sugar and the poi son
taken while cer tain Mantras are re cited. Even so works if joined with
knowl edge may ef fect fi nal eman ci pa tion.
The Purvapakshin main tains that even oblig a tory works (Nitya
Kar mas) such as Agnihotra which do not give any fruits but which are

The Purvapakshin main tains that work com bined with med i ta -

**Bhogenatvitare kshapayitva sampadyate** IV.1.19 (496)

But having exhausted by enjoyment the other two works (viz.,
good and evil works, that have begun to yield fruits), he
becomes one with Brahman.

**Bhogena:** by enjoyment; **Tu:** but; **Itare:** of the other two works (merit
and demerit); **Kshapayitva:** having exhausted; **Sampadyate:**
becomes united with Brahman, becomes one with Brahman, obtains,
joins.

This Su tra con cludes with the an swer to the ques tion “What be -
comes of the Prarabdha por tion of the il lu mined soul’s work, which
has brought his pres ent life into ex is tence.”
It has been shown that all good and evil deeds whose ef fects
have not yet be gun are de stroyed by the power of knowl edge of Brah -
man. “The two oth ers on the other hand, i.e., those good and evil
works whose ef fects have be gun, a man has at first to ex haust by the
fru ition of their con se quences, and then he be comes one with Brah -
man.” This ap pears from scrip tural pas sages such as “for him there is
de lay so long as he is not de liv ered from the body, then he will be -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 490
```

come one with Brah man” (Chh. Up. VI.14.2), and “Be ing Brah man he
goes to Brah man” (Bri. Up. IV.4.6).
The Purvapakshin ar gues that the knower of Brah man will con -
tinue to see di ver sity even af ter death, just as he sees plu ral ity while
liv ing; anal o gously to the vi sual ap pear ance of a dou ble moon which
may con tinue even af ter it has been cog nised as false. He does not
at tain one ness with Brah man even af ter death.
This Su tra re futes it and de clares that the Prarabdha works are
de stroyed through en joy ment. Though the knower of Brah man has to
re main in this world as a lib er ated sage or Jivanmukta, yet he at tains
one ness with Brah man at death.
When the Prarabdha Kar mas are ex hausted by be ing worked
out, he no lon ger be holds any plu ral ity on ac count of the ab sence of
any cause like the Prarabdha. He cer tainly be comes one with Brah -
man as all works in clud ing Prarabdha are de stroyed at death.
Thus Brahma Jnana de stroys Kar mas (Sanchita) which have
not be gun to bear fruit. Those which have be gun to bear fruit
(Prarabdha) must be worked out by en joy ment. There is no es cape
even on the part of the en light ened soul from the op er a tion of the law
of Prarabdha.
The Purvapakshin again ar gues that a new ag gre gate of works
will orig i nate a new fru ition. Not so, we re ply; the seed of all such fru -
ition is de stroyed. What on the death of the body, could orig i nate a
new pe riod of fru ition, is only a new set of works and works de pend on

INTRODUCTION
```
In the pre vi ous Sec tion it was shown that one at tains Jivanmukti
when the Sanchita Kar mas or the ac cu mu lated works which have not
as yet be gun to bear fruits are de stroyed, and Videhamukti at death
when the Prarabdha Karma is de stroyed.
This Sec tion is de voted to the mode of de par ture of the en light -
ened and the un en light ened souls at the time of leav ing the body. The
path of the gods, the Devayana, by which the knower of the Saguna
Brah man trav els af ter death, is de scribed. The Sutrakara be gins by
ex plain ing on the ba sis of scrip tural state ments the suc ces sive steps
by which the soul passes out of the body at death. The de par ture of
the soul is the same in the case of him who pos sesses the lower
knowl edge and of him who is des ti tute of all knowl edge.

**SYNOPSIS**
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-2) At the time of death of the knower of
Saguna Brah man, the func tions of the or gans get merged in mind.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Su tra 3) At the time of death of the knower of
Saguna Brah man, the func tion of the mind is merged in the Prana.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 4-6) At the time of death of the knower of
Saguna Brah man, the func tion of Prana is merged in the in di vid ual
soul or Jiva.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Su tra 7) The mode of de par ture from the body
up to the way is com mon to both a knower of Saguna Brah man and
an or di nary man. Both pass through the same stages up to the en -
trance of the soul to gether with the sub tle el e ments and so on into the
Nadis.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 8-11) The merg ing of fire, etc., of death in
the High est De ity is not ab so lute merg ing. A com plete ab sorp tion of
the el e ments takes place only when fi nal eman ci pa tion is at tained.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 12-14) The Pranas of a knower of the
Nirguna Brah man do not de part from the body at death.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Su tra 15) The or gans of the knower of the
Nirguna Brah man get merged in It at death.
_Adhikarana VIII:_ (Su tra 16) The Kalas of the knower of the
Nirguna Brah man at tain ab so lute non-dis tinc tion with Brah man at
death.
_Adhikarana IX:_ (Su tra 17) The soul of the knower of the Saguna
Brah man co mes to the heart at the time of death and thence goes out
through the Sushumna. The soul of the ig no rant man goes out by
means of some other Nadi.
_Adhikarana X:_ (Sutras 18-19) The de part ing soul of a knower of
the Saguna Brah man fol lows the rays of the sun af ter death which ex -
ist at night as well as dur ing day, and goes to Brahmaloka.
_Adhikarana XI:_ (Sutras 20-21) The soul of the knower of the
Saguna Brah man goes to Brahmaloka even if he dies dur ing the
south ern course of the sun (Dakshinayana).

At the time of death the functions of the organs

**Vangmanasi darsanacchabdaccha** IV.2.1 (497)

Speech is merged in mind, because it is so seen, and there are
scriptural statements (to that effect).

**Vak:** speech; **Manasi:** in the mind; **Darsanat:** because it is so seen or
observed, because of the scriptural declaration; **Sabdat:** because of
the word of the Vedas, because of the statement of the Smriti; **Cha:**
also, and.

This Su tra says that speech merges in the mind at death.
Till now Jivanmukti or lib er a tion while liv ing is de scribed. Now
the at tain ment of Brahmaloka by go ing along the path of gods
(Devayana) af ter death is go ing to be de scribed.
About the pro cess of dy ing we have the fol low ing pas sage,
“When a man de parts from here his speech merges in his mind, his
mind in Prana, Prana in fire and fire in the High est De ity” (Chh. Up.
VI.6.1).
Now a doubt here arises whether the or gan of speech as such
gets merged in the mind or only its func tion.
The Purvapakshin main tains that the or gan it self is merged in
the mind as there is no men tion in the text about the func tion of
speech get ting merged.
The pres ent Su tra re futes this view and de cides that only the
func tion of the or gan of speech is merged in the mind.
The merg ing is al ways of the ef fect in the cause. Speech is not
an ef fect of the mind. There fore, the or gan of speech can not merge in
the mind. But Vrittis (func tional man i fes ta tions) can merge in some -
thing which is not its cause. For in stance, heat which is the func tion of
fire orig i nates from fuel and ex tin guished in wa ter.
We see the man i fes ta tion of speech ceas ing in a dy ing man,
though his mind is still func tion ing. None sees the or gan of speech
be ing merged in the mind.
So ex pe ri ence also teaches that the func tion of speech and not
the or gan it self gets merged in mind.

**AV Ed M gdm©Ê`ZwŸ&**

**Ata eva cha sarvanyanu** IV.2.2 (498)

And for the same reason all (sense-organs) follow (mind, i.e.,
get their functions merged in it).

**Ata eva:** hence; **Cha:** and, also; **Sarvani:** all (organs); **Anu
(Anugacchanti):** after (follow).

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 494
```

This Su tra in ti mates that the func tions of all the or gans merge in
the mind at the time of death.
For the same rea sons (gen eral ex pe ri ence and cor rob o ra tive
state ment of Sruti) as stated in Su tra 1, the func tions of all the other
sense-or gans fol low, i.e., get merged in the mind. “The fire is ver ily
the Udana, for he whose light has gone out co mes to a new birth with
his senses merged in the mind” (Pras. Up. III.9).
Like the speech it is ob served that the eye and other senses dis -
con tinue their func tions, while the mind con tin ues to act. Be cause the
or gans them selves can not be ab sorbed, and be cause the text ad mits
of that in ter pre ta tion we con clude that the dif fer ent or gans fol low af ter,
i.e., are merged in the mind only as far as their func tions are con -
cerned.

```
Mano’dhikaranam: Topic 2
The function of mind is merged in Prana.
```
**VÝ_Z... àmU CÎmamV² Ÿ&**

**Tanmanah prana uttarat** IV.2.3 (499)

That mind (is merged) in Prana (as is seen) from the
subsequent clause (of the Sruti cited).

**Tat:** that; **Manah:** mind; **Prana:** in the Prana; **Uttarat:** from the
subsequent clause (of the Sruti).

It has been shown that the pas sage “speech is merged in mind”
means a merg ing of the func tion only. A doubt here arises whether the
sub se quent clause “mind is breath” also means to in ti mate a merg ing
of the func tion only or of that to which the func tion be longs.
The Purvapakshin main tains that here it is mind it self and not its
func tion that gets merged in Prana, as Prana can be said to be the
ma te rial cause of mind. In sup port of his state ment he quotes the fol -
low ing text: “Mind con sists of food, Prana of wa ter” (Chh. Up. VI.6.5);
“Wa ter sent forth earth” (VI.2.4). When mind, there fore, is merged in
Prana, it is the same thing as earth be ing merged in wa ter, for mind is
food or earth, and Prana is wa ter, causal sub stance and ef fect be ing
non-dif fer ent. Hence the Sruti here speaks not of the func tion of the
mind, but of mind it self get ting merged in Prana.
This Su tra re futes this view. For the same rea son it is the men tal
Vrittis (func tions) that get merged in Prana, be cause in deep sleep
and in ap proach ing death, we see the men tal func tions stop ping while
the Prana (breath) is ac tive. The mind is not de rived from Prana, and
hence can not merge in it. Breath or Prana is not the causal sub stance
of mind. The re la tion of cau sal ity by an in di rect pro cess does not suf -
fice to show that mind is re ally merged in Prana. Were it so, then mind
would also be merged in earth, earth in wa ter, breath in wa ter. Nor is

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 2 495
```

there on the al ter na tive con tem plated any proof of mind hav ing orig i -
nated from that wa ter which has passed over into breath.
There fore, mind can not it self be merged in Prana. The func tion

of the mind only is merged in Prana.

```
Adhyakshadhikaranam: Topic 3 (Sutras 4-6)
The function of Prana is merged in the Jiva.
```
**gmo@Ü`jo VXwnJ_m{Xä`...Ÿ&**

**So’dhyakshe tadupagamadibhyah** IV.2.4 (500)

That (Prana) is merged in the ruler (individual soul or Jiva) on
account of the (statements as to the Pranas) coming to it and
so on.

**Sah:** that (Prana); **Adhyakshe:** in the ruler (the Jiva);
**Tadupagamadibhyah:** on account of the (statements as to the
Pranas) coming to it and so on.

```
“Prana is merged in fire” (Chh. Up. VI.8.6). A doubt arises now
```
whether ac cord ing to the word of the scrip ture, the func tion of Prana
is merged in fire or in the in di vid ual soul which is the ruler of the body
and senses.
Ac cord ing to the Purvapakshin we must con clude that Prana is

merged in fire only.
The pres ent Su tra jus ti fies its view be cause state ments about
Pranas com ing to the Jiva, etc., are found in scrip tural pas sages.
“All the Pranas ap proach the de part ing man at the time of death”

(Bri. Up. IV.3.38). An other pas sage again spe cially de clares that the
Prana with its five func tions fol lows the in di vid ual soul. Af ter him thus

de part ing the Prana de parts, and that the other Pranas fol low that
Prana. “And af ter the Prana thus de part ing all the other Pranas de -
part” (Bri. Up. IV.4.2).
The text cited in Su tra 1, “When the man de parts from here, his

speech merges in mind, mind in Prana, Prana in fire and fire in the
High est De ity” (Chh. Up. VI.8.6), does not, how ever, con tra dict this

view, as the fol low ing Su tra in di cates.

**^yVofw VÀN®>Vo...Ÿ&**

**Bhuteshu tacchruteh** IV.2.5 (501)

In the (subtle) elements (is merged) (the Jiva with the Pranas)
as it is seen from the Sruti.

**Bhuteshu:** in the elements; **Tat sruteh:** as that can be understood
from Sruti, from the Sruti texts to that effect, there being a Vedic
statement about that.

```
This Su tra am pli fies the pre vi ous one.
```
```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 496
```

The soul among with Prana rests in the sub tle el e ments
(Bhuta-sukshma). This is clear from the Sruti “ _Pranastejasi_ ”.
The soul united with the Prana takes up its abode within the sub -
tle el e ments which ac com pany fire and forms the seed of the fu ture
gross body. This we con clude from the clause, “Prana in heat”. But
this pas sage in ti mates that the Prana takes up its abode and not that
the soul to gether with the Prana takes up its abode.
We re ply, it does not mat ter. The pre ced ing Su tra in ter ca lates
the soul in the in ter val be tween Prana and fire. We may say shortly of
a man who first trav els from Haridwar to Ayodhya and then from
Ayodhya to Benares that he trav els from Haridwar to Benares. The
pas sage un der dis cus sion, there fore, means that the soul to gether
with the Prana abides in the el e ments as so ci ated with fire. The Prana
is first merged in the in di vid ual soul and then the soul with the Prana
takes its abode in the fine es sence of the gross el e ments, fire etc., the
seed of the fu ture body.
But how are you en ti tled to draw in the other el e ments also,
while the text only speaks of that? To this ques tion the next Su tra
gives an an swer.
The Prana join ing the soul, merged not only in Tejas but at the
same time in other el e ments too. This can be un der stood from Sruti. It
is said to merge only in Tejas, be cause Tejas (fire), is the pre dom i nat -
ing fac tor there. “That soul is united with the es sence of the earth, of
the wa ter, of the air, of the Akasa, of the fire” (Bri. Up. IV.4.5).

**Z¡H$pñ_Z² Xe©`Vmo {hŸ&**

**Naikasmin darsayato hi** IV.2.6 (502)

(The soul with Prana is merged) not in one element only, for
both (the Sruti and Smriti) declare this (or declare so).

**Na:** not; **Ekasmin:** in one; **Darsayatah:** (both the Sruti and Smriti)
declare so, both the Sruti and Smriti show; **Hi:** as, for, because.

When the soul leaves one body at the time of death and goes in
from an other, it to gether with the sub tle body abides in the sub tle es -
sence of all the gross el e ments and not in fire only, be cause all the el -
e ments are needed for a fu ture body. The new body con sists of
var i ous el e ments. This mat ter is de clared in the ques tion and an swer
about the wa ters called man (Chh. Up. V.3.3). Vide III.1.2.
When the soul at tains an other body he does not rest in Prana
alone, but goes with the sub tle por tions of all the el e ments. The ques -
tion and an swer in the Sruti show his.
A pas sage in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad de clares that the
soul’s em bodi ment is due to Karma, for the abode con sist ing of Graha
(Indriyas or senses) and Atigraha (Vishayas or ob jects) is the ef fect of
Karma. Here the sub tle el e ments are called the abode be cause they

```

are the stuff of which the new body is made. These two views or pas -
sages do not con tra dict each other.

```
Asrityupakramadhikaranam: Topic 4
The mode of departure from the body up to the way is common to
both the knower of the Saguna Brahman and an ordinary man.
```
**g_mZm MmgwË`wnH«$_mX_¥VËd§ MmZwnmoî`Ÿ&**

**Samana chasrityupakramadamritatvam chanuposhya** IV.2.7 (503)

And common (is the mode of departure at the time of death for
both the knower of the Saguna Brahman and the ignorant) up
to the beginning of their ways; and the immortality (of the
knower of the Saguna Brahman is only relative) without
having burnt (ignorance).

**Samana:** common; **Cha:** and; **Asrityupakramat:** up to the beginning
of their ways; **Amritatvam:** immortality; **Cha:** and; **Anuposhya:**
without burning, without dissolution.

There is no de par ture for the knower of Nirguna Brah man. His
Pranas are ab sorbed in Brah man.
The Purvapakshin main tains that the mode of de par ture from
the body for the knower of Saguna Brah man and the ig no rant or the

or di nary man ought to be dif fer ent, be cause they at tain dif fer ent
abodes af ter death. The knower of Saguna Brah man goes to
Brahmaloka while the or di nary man is re born in this world.
The pres ent Su tra says that the knower of the Saguna Brah man

en ters the Sushumna Nadi at death and then goes out of the body
and then en ters the Devayana or the path of the gods while the or di -
nary ig no rant man en ters some other Nadi and goes by an other way
to have re birth.
But the mode of de par ture at death is com mon to both till they

en ter on their re spec tive ways.
Chhandogya Upanishad VIII.6.6 and Kathopanishad II.3.16 de -
clare “There are a hun dred and more Nadis in the in te rior of the heart,
of which only one leads from the heart to the head; by that, pro gress -

ing up wards, the de part ing soul at tains im mor tal ity, i.e., eman ci pa -
tion; all the other Nadis are for the egress of the or di nary peo ple for
un der go ing bond age of fre quent births and deaths.”

**Tadapiteh samsaravyapadesat** IV.2.8 (504)

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 498
```

That (fine body lasts) up to the attainment of Brahman
(through knowledge), because (the scriptures) declare the
state of relative existence (till then).

**Tat:** that, aggregate of the elements, the sum total of the subtle
elements; **Apiteh:** till the attainment of Brahman (through
knowledge); **Samsaravyapadesat:** because (scriptures) declare the
state of relative existence.

In the text cited in Su tra 1, we have “And fire is merged in the
High est De ity”. The mean ing is that the fire of the dy ing man to gether
with the in di vid ual soul, the Prana, the ag gre gate of the or gans and
the other el e ments is merged in Brah man.
We now have to con sider of what kind that merg ing is.
The Purvapakshin holds that it is an ab so lute ab sorp tion of
things merged, as it is proved that those things have the High est De ity
for their causal mat ter. For it has been es tab lished that the De ity is the
causal sub stance of all things, that have an or i gin. There fore that
pass ing into the state of non-sep a ra tion is an ab so lute one. This is the
fi nal dis so lu tion. Ev ery one at tains the fi nal eman ci pa tion at death.

This Su tra says that this merg ing is not ab so lute merg ing. Al -
though Brah man is the causal sub stance of those el e ments, they are
at the time of death, as in the case of deep sleep and a Pralaya of the
world, merged in it only in such a way as to con tinue to ex ist in a sem i -
nal con di tion or seed state. Only the func tions of these el e ments are
merged and not the el e ments them selves.

Those sub tle el e ments, fire and so on, which form the abode of
hear ing and the other or gans per sist up to fi nal re lease from the
Samsara, which is caused by per fect knowl edge, be cause the scrip -
tures de clare that till then the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul is sub ject to
rel a tive ex is tence. “Some souls en ter the womb for em bod ied ex is -
tence as or ganic be ings; oth ers go into in or ganic mat ter, ac cord ing to
their work and ac cord ing to their knowl edge” (Katha Up. II.5.7).

Oth er wise the lim it ing ad juncts of ev ery soul would at the time of
death be ab sorbed and the soul would en ter into ab so lute un ion with
Brah man. Ev ery dy ing per son will reach Brah man. This would ren der
all scrip tural in junc tion and scrip tural doc trine equally use less.

Bond age which is due to wrong knowl edge, can not be dis solved
but through per fect knowl edge (Samyag Jnana). If the merg ing at
death were ab so lute, then there could be no re birth.

**Sukshmam pramanatascha tathopalabdheh** IV.2.9 (505)
(This fine body) is subtle (by nature) and size, because it is so
observed.

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 2 499
```

**Sukshmam:** subtle; **Pramanatah:** as regards size; **Cha:** and; **Tatha:**

thus, so; **Upalabdheh:** because it is experienced, it being observed.

The el e men tary mat ter of fire and the other el e ments which form
the sub stra tum of the soul, when pass ing out of this body, must be
sub tle in its na ture and ex tent. This fol lows from the scrip tural pas -
sages, which de clare that it passes out by the Nadis and so on.
Its thin ness ren ders it ca pa ble of pass ing out through the thin
and sub tle Nadi and its trans par ency is the cause of its not be ing
stopped or ob structed by any gross sub stance, and not be ing seen by
the by-standers when it passes out at death.

**Zmon_X}ZmV...&**

**Nopamardenatah** IV.2.10 (506)

Therefore, (this subtle body is) not (destroyed) by the
destruction (of the gross body).

**Na:** not; **Upamardena:** by the destruction; **Atah:** therefore, because

of this reason.

On ac count of this great sub tlety the sub tle body is not de -
stroyed by what de stroys the gross body, viz., burn ing and the like.

**Añ`¡d MmonnÎmoaof D$î_mŸ&**

**Asyaiva chopapatteresha ushma** IV.2.11 (507)

And to this (subtle body) alone does this (bodily) heat belong,
because this (only) is possible.

**Asya:** of the subtle body; **Eva:** verily, certainly, alone; **Cha:** and, also;

**Upapatteh:** it being possible, because of possibility; **Esha:** this;

**Ushma:** (bodily) heat.

To that same sub tle body be longs the warmth which we per -
ceive in the liv ing body, by means of touch. That bodily heat is not felt
in the body af ter death, while such qual i ties as form, col our and so on,
con tinue to be per ceived. The bodily heat is felt as long as there is life.
It fol lows from this that the heat re sides in some thing dif fer ent from
the body, as or di narily known. The sub tle body im parts its own heat to
the gross body and keeps it warm as long as it re mains alive. Scrip -
ture also says, “He is warm if go ing to live; cold if go ing to die.”

BRAHMA SUTRAS 500

so, (because the scripture denies the departure of the Pranas)
from the individual soul (and not from the body).

**Pratishedhat:** on account of the denial; **Iti:** so; **Chet:** if (if it be
argued); **Na:** not so, you cannot say so; **Sarirat:** from the individual
soul.

This Su tra con sists of two parts, viz., an ob jec tion and its re ply.
The ob jec tion por tion is ‘ _Pratishedhaditi chet_ ’. The re ply por tion is ‘ _Na
sarirat; Spashto hyekesham_ ’.
This Su tra gives the view of the Purvapakshin while the thir -
teenth and four teenth Sutras state the Siddhanta or cor rect doc trine.
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad de clares, “But as to the man who
does not de sire, who not de sir ing, freed from de sires, is sat is fied in
his de sires, or de sires the Self only, of him, the vi tal airs (Pranas) do
not de part” (Bri. Up. IV.4.6). From this ex press de nial, form ing part of
the higher knowl edge, it fol lows that the Pranas do not pass out of the
body of him who knows Brah man. This Sruti pas sage re fers to one
who knows the Nirguna Brah man. It de clares that his Pranas do not
de part at death.
The Purvapakshin main tains that the pas sage quoted does not
deny the de par ture of the Pranas from the body but from the in di vid ual
soul. If the Pranas do not de part from the body there will be no death
at all. This is made clear from the Madhyandina recension which says
“From him the vi tal spir its do not de part.”
There fore, the soul of a knower of Brah man passes out of the
body with the Pranas.
The next Su tra re futes this view.

**ñnï>mo øoHo$fmåmŸ&**

**Spashto hyekesham** IV.2.13 (509)

For (the denial of the soul’s departure) is clear (in the texts) of
some schools.

**Spashtah:** clear; **Hi:** for; **Ekesham:** of some Sakhas or schools; the
statement of some Srutis.

The Pranas do not de part from the body in the case of a lib er -
ated sage. This is made clear from the Sruti texts like: “Yajnavalkya”
said Artabhaga, “when the lib er ated man dies, do his Pranas go up
from him or do they not?” “No” re plied Yajnavalkya, “they merge in
him only” (Bri. Up. III.2.11).
If the Pranas de part with the soul from the body, then the soul
will surely take a re birth. Hence there will be no eman ci pa tion.
There fore, the Pranas do not de part from the body in the case of
one who knows Brah man.

Those (Pranas, elements) (are merged) in the Supreme

Brahman, for thus the (scripture) says.

**Tani:** those; **Pare:** in the Supreme Brahman; **Tatha:** thus, so; **Hi:**
because; **Aha:** (the Sruti) says.

Those, i.e., sense-or gans de noted by the term ‘Prana’ and the
el e ments of him who knows the Su preme Brah man are merged when
he dies in the same Su preme Brah man. Why? Be cause scrip ture de -
clares that “Thus these six teen parts of this wit ness, the Purusha,
hav ing their goal in Him are dis solved on reach ing Him in Him” (Pras.
Up. VI.5).
But an other text which re fers to him who knows teaches that the
parts also are merged in some thing dif fer ent from the High est Self.
“The fif teen parts en ter into their el e ments” (Mun. Up. III.2.7). No, we
re ply. This lat ter pas sage is con cerned with the or di nary view of the
mat ter. It in ti mates the end from a rel a tive stand-point, ac cord ing to
which the whole ag gre gate of the parts of him who knows the Su -
preme Brah man is merged in Brah man only, just as the il lu sory snake
is merged in the rope.
There is thus no con tra dic tion.
Though or di narily the senses and the el e ments merge in their
causal sub stances, yet in the case of the Jnani they merge in Brah -
man.

The Kalas of the knower of the Nirguna Brahman attain
absolute non-distinction with Brahman at death

**A{d^mJmo dMZmV²Ÿ&**

**Avibhago vachanat** IV.2.16 (512)

BRAHMA SUTRAS 502
```

(Absolute) non-distinction (with Brahman of the parts merged
takes place) according to the statement (of the scriptures).

**Avibhagah:** non-distinction; **Vachanat:** on account of the statement
(of the scriptures).

“Thus these six teen con stit u ents or Kalas, viz., eleven senses
and five sub tle el e ments, be long ing to the seer, i.e., the lib er ated
sage who at tains the Su preme Brah man loses his dis tinc tion and dis -
ap pears in Him. There names and forms are de stroyed; and peo ple
speak of the Purusha only. Then he be comes partless and death less”
(Pras. Up. VI.5).
The Kalas in the case of the knower of Brah man get ab so lutely
merged in the High est Brah man. In the case of an or di nary per son it is
not so. They ex ist in a fine po ten tial state, the cause of fu ture birth.
When parts or Kalas that are the ef fects of ig no rance are dis -
solved through knowl edge it is not pos si ble that a re main der be left.
The parts, there fore, get merged ab so lutely in Brah man. There is no
chance for them for crop ping up again.

When the soul of a knower of the Saguna Brahman is about to
depart from the body, there takes place) a lighting up of the
front of its (soul’s) abode (viz., the heart); the door (of its egress)
being illumined thereby; owing to the power of knowledge and
the application of meditation to the way which is part of that
(knowledge); the soul favoured by Him in the heart (viz.,
Brahman) (passes upward) by the one that exceeds a hundred
(i.e., the hundred and first Nadi).

**Tadoko agrajvalanam:** the illumining of the top of its (soul’s) abode

light; **Vidyasamarthyat:** by the power of his knowledge; **Tat
seshagatyanusmritiyogat:** because of the application of meditation

Nadi has its origin; **Sesha:** remainder; **Gati:** path, the way;
**Anusmritiyogat:** because of the application of the remembrance or

**Anugrihitah:** being favoured by.)

The dis cus sion about the Para Vidya (Higher Knowl edge) is
over. The Sutrakara now pur sues the dis cus sion of the Apara Vidya,
i.e., Upasana (lower knowl edge).
It has been al ready stated in Su tra 7 that up to the be gin ning of
the way the de par ture of a knower of the Saguna Brah man and an ig -
no rant man is the same. The pres ent Su tra now de scribes the soul’s
en ter ing on the way. The Brihadaranyaka text de scribes the death of
a per son “He tak ing with him those el e ments of light de scends into
the heart” (Bri. Up. IV.4.1). Then again it says, “The point of his heart
be comes lighted up, and by that light the self de parts, ei ther through
the eye or through the skull or through other places of the body” (Bri.
Up. IV.4.2). The soul to gether with the or gans co mes to the heart at
the time of death.
The ques tion arises whether the de par ture is the same for a
knower of Saguna Brah man and an or di nary man.
The exit of the or di nary man is dif fer ent from that of the knower
of Saguna Brah man. The for mer goes out from any part of the body at
death (eye, ear, nose, anus, etc.). But the lat ter goes out only through
the Sushumna Nadi and out of the Brahmarandhra in the head. If he
goes out by any other way he can not at tain the Su preme Abode.
By vir tue of knowl edge and ow ing to the ap pli ca tion of con stant
thought of Brah man the point of the heart which is the abode of the
de part ing soul is il lu mined and through the grace of the su preme soul
res i dent therein, the door of egress, the mouth of the Nadi lead ing
from the heart to the head as stated in Su tra 7 is thrown open. The
soul passes into the Nadi num bered one hun dred and one. This Nadi
is the gate way of the re lease. The other one hun dred Nadis lead to
bond age.
The scrip ture says in a chap ter treat ing of the knower of Brah -
man dwell ing in the heart: “There are a hun dred and one Nadis of the
heart; one of them pen e trates the crown of the head; go ing up along
that one at tains Im mor tal ity; the oth ers serve for de par ture in dif fer ent
di rec tions)” (Chh. Up. VIII.6.5).
Al though equal ity for him who does know and him who does not
know, the point of the heart be comes shin ing and the door of egress
thereby is lighted up, yet he who knows de parts through the skull only,
while the oth ers de part from other places. Why so? On ac count of the
power of knowl edge. If also he who knows de parts like all oth ers, from
any place of the body, he would be un able to reach an ex alted sphere
and then all knowl edge would be mean ing less.

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 504
```

“And on ac count of the ap pli ca tion of med i ta tion on the way
form ing a part of that.” In dif fer ent Vidyas there is en joined med i ta tion
on the soul’s trav el ling on the way con nected with the Nadi that
passes through the skull, which way forms part of those Vidyas. Now
it is proper to con clude that he who med i tates on that way should af ter
death pro ceed on it.
There fore, he who knows be ing fa voured by Brah man dwell ing
in the heart, on which he had med i tated and thus be com ing like it in
na ture de parts by the Nadi which passes through the skull which is
the hun dred and first. The souls of other men pass out by other Nadis.

Rasmyadhikaranam: Topic 10 (Sutras 18-19)
The soul of one who knows Saguna Brahman follows
the rays of the sun after death and goes to Brahmaloka.
```
**aíå`ZwgmarŸ&**

**Rasmyanusari** IV.2.18 (514)

(The soul of a knower of the Saguna Brahman when he dies)
follows the rays (of the sun).

**Rasmi:** the rays; **Anusari:** following.

The de scrip tion of the prog ress of the re leased soul is con tin -
ued.
Chhandogya Upanishad de clares “When he thus de parts from
this body, then he de parts up wards by those very rays. By that mov ing
up wards he reaches im mor tal ity” (Chh. Up. VIII.6.5).
From this we un der stand that the soul pass ing out by the hun -
dred and first Nadi (Sushumna) fol lows the rays of the sun.
A doubt here arises as to whether the soul of one who dies by
night as well as of him who dies by day fol lows the rays, or the soul of
the lat ter only.
As scrip ture men tions no dif fer ence, the Su tra teaches that the
souls fol low the rays in both cases.

**{Z{e Zo{V MoÞ gå~ÝYñ` `mdÔoh^m{dËdmÔe©`{V MŸ&**

**Nisi neti chenna sambandhasya
yavaddehabhavitvaddarsayati cha** IV.2.19 (515)
If it be said (that the soul does) not (follow the rays) in the
night, we say (not so) because the connection (of Nadis and
rays) continues as long as the body lasts; the Sruti also
declares (this).

**Nisi:** at night, in the night; **Na:** not; **Iti:** so; **Chet:** if (if it be objected);
**Na:** not (the objection is not valid); **Sambandhasya:** of the relation;
**Yavaddehabhavitvat:** as long as the body lasts; **Darsayati:** the Sruti
shows or declares (this); **Cha:** and, also. ( **Yavad:** as long as;
**Bhavitvat:** because of the existence.)

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 2 505
```

An ob jec tion to Su tra 17 is raised and re futed.
This Su tra con sists of two parts, namely an ob jec tion and its re -
ply. The ob jec tion por tion is ‘ _Nisi neti chet_ ’ and the re ply por tion is ‘ _Na
sambandhasya yavaddehabhavitvad darsayati cha_ ’.
It might per haps be said that the Nadis and rays are con nected
dur ing the day, and so the soul of a per son who dies dur ing the day
may fol low those rays but not the soul of one who dies by night, when
the con nec tion of the Nadis and the rays bro ken.
But this is an er ro ne ous no tion, for the con nec tion of rays and
Nadis lasts as long as the body ex ists. Hence it is im ma te rial whether
the soul passes out by day or by night.
Fur ther we ob serve that the rays of the sun con tinue to ex ist in
the nights of the sum mer sea son, be cause we feel their warmth and
other ef fects. Dur ing the nights of the other sea sons they are dif fi cult
to per ceive, be cause then few only con tinue to ex ist, just as dur ing
the cloudy days of the cold sea son. The Sruti also de clares, “Even by
night the sun sheds his rays.”
We can not pre de ter mine the move ment of death. If such de par -
ture to the su preme abode is de nied to the per son dy ing in the night,
no one will take to Upasana. The re sult of knowl edge can not be made
to de pend on the ac ci dent of death by day or night.
If again a man dy ing at night should wait for the dawn to mount
up wards, it might hap pen that, ow ing to the ac tion of the fu neral fire
etc., his body would at the time of day-break, not be ca pa ble of en ter -
ing into con nec tion with the rays. The scrip ture more over ex pressly
de clares that he does not wait. “As quickly as he sends off the mind
he goes to the sun” (Chh. Up. VIII.6.5).
For all these rea sons the soul fol lows the rays by night as well
as by day.

```
Dakshinayanadhikaranam: Topic 11 (Sutras 20-21)
Even if the knower of the Saguna Brahman dies in
Dakshinayana, he still goes to Brahmaloka.
```
**AVüm`Zo@{n X{jUoŸ&**

**Ataschayane’pi dakshine** IV.2.20 (516)

And for the same reason (the departed soul follows the rays)
also during the sun’s southern course.

**Atah:** for this very reason, therefore, for the same reason; **Cha:** and;
**Ayane:** during the sun’s course; **Api:** also, even; **Dakshine:** in the
southern.

This Su tra is a cor ol lary drawn from the pre ced ing Su tra.
The Purvapakshin raises an ob jec tion and main tains that the
soul of the knower of Brah man who passes away dur ing
Dakshinayana or the south ern course of the sun does not fol low the

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 506
```

rays to Brahmaloka. The Sruti and the Smriti de clare that only one
who dies dur ing Uttarayana or the north ern course of the sun goes to
Brahmaloka.
Fur ther it is also writ ten that Bhishma waited for the north ern
course of the sun to leave the body.
This Su tra says that for the same rea son as men tioned in the
pre vi ous Su tra, i.e., the un rea son able ness of mak ing the re sult of
knowl edge de pend on the ac ci dent of death hap pen ing at a par tic u lar
time, the knower of Saguna Brah man goes to Brahmaloka even if he
dies dur ing the south ern course of the sun.
For the same rea son, viz., be cause wait ing is im pos si ble, and
be cause the fruit of knowl edge is not merely even tual one, and be -
cause the time of death is not fixed, also he who has true knowl edge,
and who dies dur ing the south ern course of the sun ob tains the fruit of
his knowl edge.
In the text “Those who know thus go by light, from light to day,
from day to the bright half of the month, and from that to the six
months of the north ern course of the sun” (Chh. Up. V.10.1), the
points in the north ern course of the sun do not re fer to any di vi sion of
time but to de i ties as will be shown un der IV.3.4.
The Devayana path can be trod den by those who die in the
Dakshinayana.
Bhishma waited for the Uttarayana, be cause he wanted to up -
hold an ap proved cus tom and to show that he could die at will ow ing
to his fa ther’s boon.

**Yoginah prati cha smaryate smarte chaite** IV.2.21 (517)

And (these times or details) are recorded by Smriti with
reference to the Yogins and these two (Yoga and Sankhya) and
classed as Smritis (only).

**Yoginah prati:** with respect to the Yogi; **Cha:** and; **Smaryate:** the
Smriti declares; **Smarte:** belonging to the class of Smritis; **Cha:** and;
**Ete:** these two.

The ar gu ment in the two pre ced ing Sutras is strength ened here
by fur ther ex po si tion.
The Purvapakshin says: We have the fol low ing Smriti text, “That
time wherein go ing Yogins re turn not, and also that wherein go ing
forth they re turn, that time shall I de clare to thee, O Prince of the
Bharatas” (Gita VIII. 23-24). This de ter mines spe cially that to die by
day and so on causes the soul not to re turn. How then can he who
dies by night or dur ing the sun’s south ern course de part not to re turn?
The de ci sion of the pre vi ous Su tra can not be cor rect.

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 2 507
```

This Su tra re futes the ob jec tion and says that these de tails as to
time men tioned in the Gita ap ply only to Yo gis who prac tise Sadhana
ac cord ing to Yoga and Sankhya sys tems. These two are Smritis, not
Srutis. There fore, the lim i ta tions as to the time men tioned in them do
not ap ply to those who med i tate on the Saguna Brah man ac cord ing to
the Sruti texts.
Yoga and Sankhya are mere Smritis. They are not of spir i tual
char ac ter. As it has a dif fer ent sphere of ap pli ca tion, and is based on
a spe cial kind of au thor ity, the Smriti rule as to the time of dy ing has no
in flu ence on knowl edge based on scrip ture.
But an ob jec tion is raised. We have such pas sages as “Fire,
light, the day, the bright half of the month, the six months of the north -
ern path, smoke, night, the dark half of the month, the six months of
the south ern path” (Gita VIII. 24-25), in which though be long ing to
Smriti we re cog nise the path of the fa thers as de ter mined by scrip -
ture.
Our ref u ta tion, we re ply, of the claims of Smriti ap plies only to
the con tra dic tion which may arise from the teach ing of Smriti re gard -
ing the le git i mate time of dy ing, “I will tell you the time,” etc. In so far as
Smriti also men tions Agni and the other di vin i ties which lead on the
de parted soul, there is no con tra dic tion what so ever.
What ap pears to re fer to time in the above pas sage re fers only
to the de i ties pre sid ing over the day-time and the bright half of the
month and the Uttarayana and over the night time, and the dark half of
the month and the Dakshinayana.

Brah man by the path of the gods (Devayana) has been de scribed.
Now the pres ent Sec tion treats of the path it self. It de scribes the jour -

**SYNOPSIS**
_Adhikarana I:_ (Su tra 1) The path con nected with de i ties be gin -

_Adhikarana II:_ (Su tra 2) The de part ing soul reaches the de ity of
the year and then the de ity of the air.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Su tra 3) Af ter reach ing the de ity iden ti fied with
light ning the soul reaches the world of Varuna.
_Adhikaranas I, II, III_ (Sutras 1-3) rec on cile the dif fer ent ac counts
given in the Upanishads as to the sta tions on the way which leads the
Upasaka to Saguna Brah man.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Sutras 4-6) Light, etc., re ferred to in the text de -
scrib ing the path of the gods mean de i ties iden ti fied with the light, etc.,
which lead the soul stage af ter stage till Brahmaloka is reached.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 7-14) The Brah man to which the de -
parted souls go by the path of the gods is the Saguna Brah man. This
is the opin ion pro pounded in Sutras 7-11 by Baadarayana. In Sutras
12-14 Jaimini de fends the op po site view ac cord ing to which the soul
of the Upasaka goes to the High est Brah man, not to the Karya Brah -
man (Saguna Brah man). Jaimini’s view is a mere Purvapaksha, while
Baadari’s opin ion rep re sents the Siddhanta.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 15-16) Only those who have wor shipped
the Saguna Brah man with out a sym bol at tain Brahmaloka.

Archiradyadhikaranam: Topic 1
The path connected with the deities beginning with that of light
is the only path that leads to Brahmaloka.
```
**A{M©am{XZm VËà{WVo...Ÿ&**

**Archiradina tatprathiteh** IV.3.1 (518)

On the path connected with light (the departed soul of the

knower of Saguna Brahman travels to Brahmaloka after

death), that being well-known (from the Sruti).

**Archiradina:** by the path of the rays, etc., by the rays of light and so

on, on the path connected with deities, beginning with that of light;

**Tatprathiteh:** that being well-known (from the Sruti).

It has been ex plained that up to the be gin ning of the way the de -
par ture is the same. In the last sec tion it was stated that the knower of
the Saguna Brah man trav els to Devayana or the path of the gods to
Brahmaloka. But dif fer ent texts make dif fer ent dec la ra tions about the
way it self.
One pas sage de scribes it as con sti tuted by the junc tion of the
Nadis and rays: “Then he mounts up wards by just those rays” (Chh.
Up. VIII.6.5). An other pas sage de scribes it as be gin ning with light.
“They go to the light, from light to day” (Chh. Up. V.10.1). An other way
is de scribed in Kaushitaki Upanishad I.3: “Hav ing reached the path of
the gods, he co mes to the world of Agni.” An other way is de scribed in
Bri. Up. V.10.1: “When the per son goes away from this world he co -
mes to the wind.” An other way is de scribed in Mun. Up. I.2.11: “Free
from pas sion they de part through the gate of the sun.”
A doubt here arises whether these ways are dif fer ent from each
other or whether there is only one path, the path of the gods of which
the dif fer ent texts men tion dif fer ent par tic u lars, or give dif fer ent de -
scrip tions.
The Purvapakshin main tains that these texts re fer to dif fer ent
paths to Brahmaloka.
The pres ent Su tra re futes this view and de clares that all the
texts re fer to one path only and give only dif fer ent par tic u lars of the
same path, the path con nected with de i ties be gin ning with that iden ti -
fied with light. Why so? On ac count of its be ing widely known, from
the Sruti texts that this is the path for all knowers of Brah man.
The text “Those who know this (Panchagni Vidya) and those
who in the for est med i tate with faith and aus ter ity reach the de ity iden -
ti fied with light” (Chh. Up. V.10.1), ex pressly states that the path con -
nected with de i ties be gin ning with that of the flame be longs to all
knowers of Brah man what ever be the Vidya by which they have at -
tained that knowl edge.

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 3 511
```

The goal, viz., Brahmaloka, is the same in all cases. Some part
of the path is re cog nised in all texts. All the fol low ing pas sages de -
clare one and the same re sult, viz., the at tain ment of the world of
Brah man. “In these worlds of Brah man they dwell for ever and ever”
(Bri. Up. VI.2.15). “There he dwells eter nal years” (Bri. Up. V.10.1).
“What ever vic tory, what ever great ness be longs to Brah man, that vic -
tory he gains, that great ness he reaches” (Kau. Up. I.2). There is no
jus ti fi ca tion to re gard the path as dif fer ent on ac count of its be ing dealt
with in dif fer ent chap ters.
Hence we have to con clude that all the texts re fer to the same
path but give dif fer ent par tic u lars which have all to be com bined for a
full de scrip tion of the path.
Though var i ous Srutis re fer to the path by such words as Archis
(light), Surya (sun), Vayu (wind), etc., yet they all re fer only to dif fer ent
por tions of one and the same way, viz., Archiradi-marga or Devayana
which leads to Brahmaloka. Each Sruti gives us some thing indicatory
of the path and we have to com bine the di verse par tic u lars.

```
Vayvadhikaranam: Topic 2
The departing soul reaches the deity of the year
and then the deity of the air.
```
**dm`w_ãXmX{deof{deofmä`m_²Ÿ&**

**Vayumabdadaviseshaviseshabhyam** IV.3.2 (519)

(The departed soul) (of a knower of the Saguna Brahman goes)
from the deity of the year to the deity of the air on account of
the absence and presence of specification.

**Vayum:** the deity of the air; **Abdat:** from the deity of the year;
**Aviseshaviseshabhyam:** because of non-specification and
specification, because it is stated in general in one Sruti and in detail
in another.

The de scrip tion of the path of the gods is con tin ued.
The Su tra fixes the or der of the stages. The Kaushitaki
Upanishad de scribes the path as fol lows: “The Upasaka or the wor -
ship per, hav ing reached the path of the gods co mes to the world of
Agni (fire), to the world of Vayu (air), to the world of Varuna, to the
world of Indra, to the world of Prajapati, and then to the world of
Brahma” (Kau. Up. I.3).
Now the world of Agni means the same as light, as both terms
de note burn ing, and we, there fore, need not with re gard to them
search for the or der in which they are to be com bined.
Again the Chhandogya Upanishad (V.10.1) de scribes the path
as fol lows: “They reach the de ity iden ti fied with the light, from him to
the de ity of the day, from him to the de ity of the bright half of the
month, from him to the de i ties iden ti fied with six months of the north -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 512
```

ern path of the sun, from them to the de ity of the year, from him to the
de ity of the sun, from him to the de ity of the moon, from him to the de -
ity of the light ning”. Here Vayu is not men tioned in the path be gin ning
with light. There is ab sence of spec i fi ca tion.
In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Vayu is men tioned be fore
Aditya. “When the per son goes away from this world he co mes to
Vayu. Then Vayu makes room for him like the hole of a wheel, and
through it he mounts higher, he co mes to Aditya.” On ac count of this
spec i fi ca tion which shows Vayu to come be fore Aditya, Vayu must be
in serted be tween the year and Aditya. We should con clude that the
soul goes to Vayuloka be fore go ing to the sun.
The Brihadaranyaka text (V.10.1) fixes that air co mes im me di -
ately be fore the sun, be cause there is reg u lar or der of suc ces sion.
But as re gards air com ing af ter the de ity of fire there is no spec i fi ca -
tion but sim ply a state ment “Hav ing reached the path of the gods he
co mes to the world of Agni, to the world of Vayu.”
The Vajasaneyins in their text re cord “From the de i ties iden ti fied
with the six months in which the sun trav els north wards he reaches
the de ity iden ti fied with the world of the gods” (Bri. Up. VI.2.15). Here
in or der to main tain the im me di ate suc ces sion of the de ity iden ti fied
with Vayu (air) and that iden ti fied with the sun (Aditya) we must un der -
stand that the soul passes from the de ity of the world of the gods to
the de ity of air.
Again in the texts of the Chhandogya and the Brihadaranyaka
the de ity of the world of the gods is not men tioned in the for mer and
the de ity of the year in the lat ter. Both texts are au thor i ta tive. Both
have to be in cluded in the full de scrip tion of the path. As the year is
con nected with the months, the de ity of the year pre cedes the de ity of
the world of the gods.
Hence the se quence is Archis (rays), Ahas (day), Suklapaksha
(bright half of the month), six months when the sun trav els to the
north, year, the world of the gods, the world of Vayu, the sun, the
moon, the light ning, the world of Varuna, the world of Indra, the world
of Prajapati and the world of Brahma.

After (reaching) the deity of lightning (the soul reaches)

**Taditah adhi:** after the deity of lightning; **Varunah:** (comes) Varuna
(rain god); **Sambandhat:** on account of connection.

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 3 513
```

The enu mer a tion of the sta tions of the jour ney is con tin ued.
In the Chhandogya text we find, “From the sun to the moon,
from moon to light ning.” In the Kaushitaki Upanishad we find, “From
Vayu (wind) to Varuna.” Com bin ing the two texts we have to place
Varuna af ter light ning, on ac count of the con nec tion be tween the two
(light ning and Varuna). The broad lightnings dance forth from the
womb of the clouds with the sound of deep thun der and then wa ter
falls down. “It light ens, it thun ders, it will rain” (Chh. Up. VII. 1 1.1).
Varuna is the god of rain and light ning pre cedes rain. So af ter light -
ning co mes Varuna.
Af ter Varuna come Indra and Prajapati for there is no other
place for them. The Kaushitaki text also puts them there.
The com plete enu mer a tion of the stages of the path of the gods
is as fol lows: first the de ity of fire, then the de ity of the day, the de ity of
the bright half of the month, the de i ties of the six months when the sun
trav els to the north, the de ity of the year, the de ity of the world of gods,
the de ity of the air, the sun, the moon, the de ity of light ning, the world
of Varuna, the world of Indra, the world of Prajapati, and fi nally
Brahmaloka.

```
Ativahikadhikaranam: Topic 4 (Sutras 4-6)
Light, etc., referred to in the text describing the path of the gods
mean deities identified with light, etc., who conduct the soul
stage after stage till Brahmaloka is reached.
```
**Am{Vdm{hH$mñV{ëb“mV²Ÿ&**

**Ativahikastallingat** IV.3.4 (521)
(These are) deities conducting the soul (on the path of the
gods), on account of indicatory marks to that effect.

**Ativahikah:** conductors, deities conducting the departed soul;
**Tad-lingat:** on account of indicatory marks to that effect.

The de scrip tion of the path of the gods is con tin ued.
With re gard to those be gin ning with light a doubt arises whether
they are marks of the road, or places of en joy ment, or con duc tors of
the trav el ling souls.
The Purvapakshin says: Light and so on are marks of the road,
be cause the in struc tion has that char ac ter. In or di nary life a man who
wishes to go to a vil lage or a town is told “Go from here to that hill,
from there to a ban yan tree, from that tree to a river, from that to a vil -
lage, af ter that you will reach the town.” So here also the text says,
“From light to day, from day to the wax ing half of the month,” etc.
Or else light and so on may be viewed as places of en joy ment.
Be cause the text con nects Agni and so on with the “world” “He co mes
to the world of Agni.” Now the term “world” de notes places of en joy -

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 514
```

ment of liv ing be ings, as when we say “the world of men”, “the world of
fa thers”, “the world of gods”.

There fore, light and the rest are not con duc tors. Fur ther they
can not be con duc tors as they are with out in tel li gence. In or di nary life,
in tel li gent men only are ap pointed by the king to con duct trav el lers
over dif fi cult roads.

The pres ent Su tra re futes this. They must be the con duc tors.
They re ceive the de parted souls and con duct them on their way to
Brahmaloka. That con duc tors are meant here and not marks or
places of en joy ment is in di cated by the text of the Chhandogya which
ends thus, “From the moon to the light ning. Then a be ing who is not a
man leads them to Brah man” (Chh. Up. IV.15.5; V.10.1). This text
shows that un like the pre vi ous guides or con duc tors who were more
or less hu man, this par tic u lar guide or con duc tor is not a hu man in na -
ture—“ _Amanava_ ”.

**C^`ì`m_mohmÎmpËgÕo...Ÿ&**

**Ubhayavyamohat tatsiddheh** IV.3.5 (522)
(That deities or divine guides are meant in these texts, they are
personal conductors) is established, because both (i.e., the
path and the traveller) become unconscious.

**Ubhaya:** both (the path and the traveller); **Vyamohat:** because of
unconsciousness; **Tat-siddheh:** that is established.

This Su tra is an ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 4.
The de parted souls are not ca pa ble of guid ing them selves as
their or gans are with drawn in the mind. The light, etc., are with out in -
tel li gence. Hence they are equally in ca pa ble and can not guide the
souls. Hence it fol lows that the par tic u lar in tel li gent de i ties iden ti fied
with the light, etc., guide the souls to Brahmaloka. In or di nary life also
drunken or sense less peo ple fol low a road as com manded by oth ers.

Again light and the rest can not be taken for marks of the path or
road, be cause they are not al ways pres ent.

Fur ther the de parted souls can not en joy as their or gans are
with drawn into the mind. Hence light and the rest can not be worlds
where they en joy.

Al though the wan der ers or the de parted souls do not en joy any -
thing, the word “world” may be ex plained on the ground that those
worlds are places of en joy ment for other be ings dwell ing there.

The con clu sion, there fore, is that he who has reached the world
of Agni is led on by Agni and he who has reached the world ruled by
Vayu is led by Vayu.

From thence (the souls are led or guided) by the very same

**Vaidyutena:** by the (superhuman) guide connected with lightning, by
the superhuman being who takes his charge from the god of lightning;
**Eva:** alone, only, indeed; **Tatah:** from thence; **Tat sruteh:** that being
known from the Sruti, as Sruti states so, because of the Vedic text.

The dis cus sion on the jour ney is con tin ued.

(Bri. Up. VI.2.15).

**Karyam:** the relative Brahman or Hiranyagarbha; **Baadarih:** the

possibility of being the goal.

A dis cus sion is now taken up whether the soul is con ducted to
the Nirguna Brah man or the Saguna Brah man.
In the pre vi ous Su tra the way was dis cussed.
Now from this Su tra on wards the dis cus sion is about the goal
reached.
The Chhandogya text de clares, “Then a be ing who is not a man
(Amanava Purusha) leads them to Brah man” (Chh. Up. V.10.1).
A doubt arises whether the Brah man is the Saguna Brah man or
the Su preme Nirguna Brah man. The opin ion of the teacher Baadari is
that the per son, who is not a man, leads them to the lower qual i fied,
ef fected Brah man (Saguna or Karya Brah man); be cause it is pos si ble

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 516

to go to that. Be cause Saguna Brah man which oc cu pies a def i nite
place, which has a spe cial abode and which is fi nite can be the goal of
a jour ney. But it is not pos si ble with re spect to the Nirguna Brah man
which is In fi nite and all-per vad ing. With the High est Nirguna Brah man
on the other hand, we can not con nect the ideas of one who goes, or
ob ject of go ing or act of go ing; be cause that Brah man is pres ent ev -

CHAPTER IV—SECTION 3 517
```

On the dissolution of the Brahmaloka (the souls attain) along

with the ruler of that world what is higher than that (i.e., the

Supreme Brahman) on account of the declaration of the Sruti.

**Karyatyaye:** on the dissolution of the Brahmaloka ( **Karya:** of the

effect, i.e., the universe, the relative Saguna Brahman); **Tad:** of that;
**Adhyakshena:** with the ruler-president, i.e., Hiranyagarbha or the
four-faced Brahma; **Saha:** with; **Atahparam:** higher than that, i.e., the
Supreme Brahman; **Abhidhanat:** on account of the declaration of the

Sruti.

The in di vid ual soul’s fi nal ab sorp tion in the Para Brah man or the
Ab so lute is now stated.
The Purvapakshin says: If the souls who go by the path of the
gods reach the Saguna Brah man, then how can state ments like,
“They who pro ceed on that path do not re turn to the life of man” (Chh.
Up. IV.15.6); “For them there is no re turn here” (Bri. Up. VI.2.15);
“Mov ing up wards by that a man reaches im mor tal ity” (Chh. Up.
VIII.6.5), be made with re spect to them, as there is no per ma nency
any where apart from the High est Brah man?

The Su tra de clares that at the dis so lu tion of Brahmaloka the
souls, which by that time have at tained knowl edge, along with the
Saguna Brah man at tain what is higher than the Saguna Brah man,
i.e., Para Brah man or the pure high est place of Vishnu. This is called
Kramamukti or suc ces sive (pro gres sive) lib er a tion or re lease by suc -
ces sive steps. So the Sruti texts de clare.

**ñ_¥VoüŸ&**

**Smritescha** IV.3.11 (528)

And on account of the Smriti (texts supporting this view).

**Smriteh:** on account of the statement of the Smriti, as Smriti agrees

An ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 10 is ad duced.
The view ex pressed in the pre ced ing Su tra is cor rob o rated by
Smriti also, “When the Pralaya has come and when the first per son
(Hiranyagarbha) co mes to His end, then they all, to gether with Brah -
man, with pu ri fied minds en ter the high est place.”

The above are the Siddhanta Sutras. The fi nal con clu sion
(Siddhanta), there fore is that the go ing of the souls of which scrip ture
speaks, has for its goal the Karya Brah man or Saguna Brah man.
The Purvapaksha is stated in Sutras 12-14.

BRAHMA SUTRAS 518

To the highest (Brahman) (the souls are led); Jaimini opines,

‘Brahman’).

**Param:** the Supreme (Brahman); **Jaiminih:** the sage Jaimini (opines
or holds); **Mukhyatvat:** on account of that being the primary meaning
(of the word ‘Brahman’).

Sutras 12-14 give a _prima fa cie_ view of the mat ter. An ob jec tion
to Su tra 7 is ad duced by pre sent ing an op po site view.
Jaimini is of opin ion that the word ‘Brah man’ in the Chhandogya
text “He leads them to Brah man” re fers to the High est Brah man, as
that is the pri mary mean ing of the word.

**Xe©ZmƒŸ&**

**Darsanaccha** IV.3.13 (530)

And because the Sruti declares that.

**Darsanat:** on account of the Sruti texts; **Cha:** and, also.

An ar gu ment in sup port of Jaimini is ad duced.
The text “Go ing up wards by that he reaches im mor tal ity” (Chh.
Up. VIII.6.6) (Katha Up. II.6.16) de clares that im mor tal ity is at tained
by go ing. But im mor tal ity is pos si ble only in the Su preme Brah man,
not in the Saguna Brah man, be cause the lat ter is tran si tory. So scrip -
ture says, “Where one sees some thing else, that is lit tle, that is mor -
tal” (Chh. Up. VIII.24.1).
Ac cord ing to the text of the Kathopanishad also the go ing of the
soul is to wards the su preme Brah man. The soul which passes out of
the body by the Sushumna Nadi reaches im mor tal ity. This can be at -
tained only in the Su preme Brah man.

**Z M H$m`} à{VnÎ`{^gpÝY...Ÿ&**

**Na cha karye pratipattyabhisandhih** IV.3.14 (531)

And the desire to attain Brahman cannot be with respect to the

Saguna Brahman.

**Na:** not; **Cha:** and; **Karye:** in the Saguna Brahman; **Pratipatti:**
realisation of Brahman; **Abhisandhih:** desire. ( **Pratipatti-
abhisandhih:** the desire to attain or realise Brahman.)

The ar gu ment in sup port of Su tra 12 is con tin ued.
“I en ter the hall of Prajapati, the house” (Chh. Up. VIII.14.1),
can not have the lower or Saguna Brah man for its ob ject. This de sire
to en ter the ‘hall’ or the ‘house’ can not be with re spect to the Saguna
Brah man. It is ap pro pri ate with re gard to the High est Brah man (Para
Brah man). Be cause the im me di ately pre ced ing pas sage in ti mates
“And that within which these (names and forms) are con tained is
Brah man.” The pas sage “I am the glory of the Brahmanas” rep re -

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 3 519
```

sents “the soul as the self of all”. ‘Glory’ is the name of the su preme
Brah man. “There is no like ness of him whose name is great glory”

(Vajasaneya Samhita: XXXII.3). Here the Su preme Brah man is re -
ferred to.

```
Sutras 12-14 give the view of the Purvapakshin against what
```
has been said in Sutras 7-11. The ar gu ments of Sutras 12-14 are re -
futed thus:

```
The Brah man at tained by those who go by the path of the gods
```
(Devayana) can not be the Su preme Brah man (Nirguna Brah man).
They at tain only the Saguna Brah man. Para Brah man is all-per vad -

ing. He is the In ner Self of all. He can not be at tained as He is the In -

ner most Self of ev ery one.
We do not go to what is al ready reached. Or di nary ex pe ri ence

rather tells us that a per son goes to some thing dif fer ent from him.

Jour ney or at tain ment is pos si ble only where there is dif fer ence,
where the attainer is dif fer ent from the at tained.

```
The Su preme Brah man can not be as sumed to pos sess any dif -
```
fer ences de pend ing on time, or space or any thing else and can not,
there fore, be come the ob ject of go ing.

```
In the reali sa tion of the Su preme Brah man the veil of ig no rance
```
is re moved and the seeker knows his es sen tial di vine na ture. He real -
ises his iden tity with the Su preme Brah man. When the ig no rance is

re moved Brah man man i fests it self. That is all. There is no go ing or at -
tain ing in such a reali sa tion.

```
But the at tain ment of Brah man spo ken of in the texts con nected
```
with the path of the gods is not merely the re moval of ig no rance but
ac tual.

```
The pas sage “I en ter the hall of Prajapati, the house”, can be
```
sep a rated from what pre cedes and be con nected with the Saguna
Brah man.

```
The fact that Chh. Up. VIII.14.1 says “I am the glory of the
```
Brahmanas, of the kings” can not make it re fer to the Nirguna Brah -
man, be cause the Saguna Brah man can also be said to be the self of

all, as we find in texts like “He, to whom all works, all de sires be long”

(Chh. Up. III.14.2).
The ref er ence to the jour ney to Brah man which be longs to the

realm of rel a tive or qual i fied knowl edge in a chap ter which deals with

the High est Knowl edge is only by way of glo ri fi ca tion of the lat ter.
For all these rea sons the view of Baadari as set forth in Sutras

7-11 is the cor rect one.

**Apratikalambanannayatiti baadarayana**

**ubhayathadoshattatkratuscha** IV.3.15 (532)

Baadarayana holds that (the superhuman being) leads (to
Brahmaloka only) those who do not take recourse to a symbol
of Brahman in their meditation; there being no fault in the
twofold relation (resulting from this opinion) and (it being
construed on the doctrine) as is the meditation on that (i.e.,
Brahman) so does one become.

**Apratikalambanat:** those who do not have recourse to the symbols
for the meditation of Brahman; **Nayati:** (the superhuman being) leads
or takes; **Iti Baadarayanah:** so says Baadarayana; **Ubhayatha:** both
ways; **Adoshat:** there being no defects; **Tat-kratuh:** as is the
meditation on that, (so does one become); **Cha:** and.

The dis cus sion com menced is Su tra 6, whether the soul is
taken to the Su preme Brah man or the Saguna Brah man is con cluded
in this and the fol low ing Su tra.
A doubt here arises whether all wor ship pers of the Saguna
Brah man go to Brahmaloka be ing led by the su per hu man be ing men -
tioned in Chh. Up. IV.15.5 or only some of them?
The Purvapakshin main tains that all go to Brahmaloka what ever
may be their Upasana.
This Su tra de clares that only those wor ship pers of the Saguna
Brah man who do not take re course to any sym bol in their med i ta tion
on Brah man go there. This is the opin ion of the teacher Baadarayana.
This, how ever, does not con tra dict what is said in III.3.31 if we un der -
stand that by ‘all’ is meant all those wor ship pers who do not take re -
course to any sym bol in their med i ta tion on Brah man.
Only Brahma Upasakas are taken by the Amanava Purusha to
the Brahmaloka. The form of med i ta tion gov erns the re sult. In the
case of sym bols like the Salagrama stone, there is no feel ing that it it -
self is Brah man. No doubt in the case of Panchagni-Vidya, the Sruti
says that the wor ship per is led to Brahmaloka. But we can not ex tend
the re sult to the wor ship pers of ex ter nal sym bols where there is no di -
rect scrip tural state ment, we have to un der stand that only those who
med i tate on Brah man go to Brahmaloka, not oth ers.
He whose med i ta tion is fixed on Brah man reaches Brahmaloka.
This view is sup ported by Sruti and Smriti. “In what ever form they
med i tate on Him, that they be come them selves.” In the case of sym -
bols on the other hand, the med i ta tion is not fixed on Brah man, the

```
CHAPTER IV—SECTION 3 521
```

sym bol be ing the chief el e ment in the med i ta tion. Hence the wor ship -
per does not at tain Brahmaloka.

**{deof#m M Xe©`{VŸ&**

**Visesham cha darsayati** IV.3.16 (533)

And the scripture declares a difference (in the case of
meditation on symbols).

**Visesham:** difference; **Cha:** and; **Darsayati:** the scripture declares.

An ar gu ment in sup port of the con clu sion ar rived at by
Baadarayana, is ad duced here.
With ref er ence to med i ta tions on sym bols such as name and so
on, that oc cur in Chhandogya Upanishadic texts, the Sruti speaks of
dif fer ent re sults ac cord ing to dif fer ence in the sym bols. “One who
med i tates upon name as Brah man be comes in de pend ent so far as
name reaches” (Chh. Up. VII.1.5). “One who med i tates upon speech
as Brah man be comes in de pend ent so far as speech reaches” (Chh.
Up. VII.2.2).
Now the dis tinc tion of re wards is pos si ble be cause the med i ta -
tions de pend on sym bols, while there could be no such dif fer ence in
re sults, if they de pend on the one non-dif fer ent Brah man.
Hence it is quite clear that those who use sym bols for their med i -
ta tion can not have the same re ward as oth ers. They can not go to
Brahmaloka like those who med i tate on the Saguna Brah man.

**SYNOPSIS**
_Adhikarana I:_ (Sutras 1-3) the re leased soul does not ac quire
any thing new but merely man i fests it self in its true na ture.
_Adhikarana II:_ (Su tra 4) de ter mines that re la tion in which the re -
leased soul stands to Brah man is that of Avibhaga, non-sep a ra tion.
_Adhikarana III:_ (Sutras 5-7) dis cuss the char ac ter is tics of the
soul that has at tained the Nirguna Brah man. Ac cord ing to Jaimini the
re leased soul, when man i fest ing it self in its true na ture, pos sesses
the at trib utes which in Chh. Up. VIII.7.1 and other places are as cribed
to Brah man, such as Apahatapapmatva (free dom from sin),
Satyasankalpatva (true vo li tion) and Aisvarya (Om ni science) etc.
Ac cord ing to Audulomi the only char ac ter is tics of the re leased
soul is Chaitanya or pure in tel li gence.
Ac cord ing to Baadarayana the two views can be com bined. The
two views de scribe the re leased soul from two dif fer ent stand points,
viz., rel a tive and tran scen den tal and so there is no con tra dic tion be -
tween the two.
_Adhikarana IV:_ (Sutras 8-9) The soul which has at tained the
Saguna Brah man ef fects its de sires by mere will.
_Adhikarana V:_ (Sutras 10-14) A re leased soul which has at -
tained Brahmaloka can ex ist with or with out a body ac cord ing to its lik -
ing.
_Adhikarana VI:_ (Sutras 15-16) The re leased soul which has at -
tained the Saguna Brah man can an i mate sev eral bod ies at the same
time.
_Adhikarana VII:_ (Sutras 17-22) The re leased soul which has at -
tained Brahmaloka has all the lordly pow ers ex cept the power of cre -
ation, etc. There is no re turn to this world for these re leased souls.

Sampadyavirbhavadhikaranam: Topic 1 (Sutras 1-3)
The liberated soul does not acquire anything new
but only manifests its essential or true nature.
```
**gånÚm{d^m©d... ñdoZ eãXmV²Ÿ&**

**Sampadyavirbhavah svena sabdat** IV.4.1 (534)

(When the Jiva or the individual soul) has attained (the highest
light) there is manifestation (of its own real nature) as we infer
from the word ‘own’.

**Sampadya:** having attained; **Avirbhavah:** there is manifestation;
**Svena sabdat:** from the word ‘own’. ( **Svena:** by one’s own; **Sabdat:**
inferred from the word.)

The Chhandogya text says “Now this se rene and happy be ing,
af ter hav ing risen out of this body and hav ing at tained the high est
light, man i fests it self by its own na ture” (Chh. Up. VII.12.3).
The Purvapakshin holds that the Jiva or the in di vid ual soul
which has freed it self from iden ti fi ca tion with the three bod ies at tains
eman ci pa tion af ter real is ing Brah man. Re lease also is a fruit like
other fruits, e.g., Svarga or heaven. Man i fes ta tion means as much as
orig i na tion. Lib er a tion was not a pre-ex is tent thing. It is some thing
that is newly ac quired like heaven, as the word ‘reaches’ in the text
clearly in di cates. There fore eman ci pa tion is some thing new that is
ac quired by the in di vid ual soul. If the man i fes ta tion took place only
through the self’s own na ture, it would al ready ap pear in the self’s for -
mer states, be cause a thing’s own na ture is never ab sent in it.
The pres ent Su tra re futes this view and says that the word ‘own’
in di cates that eman ci pa tion was a pre-ex is tent thing. The in di vid ual
soul man i fests its own, es sen tial di vine na ture which was so long cov -
ered by ig no rance (Avidya). This is his at tain ment of the fi nal be at i -
tude or re lease. It is cer tainly noth ing that is newly ac quired.

**_wº$... à{VkmZmV² Ÿ&**

**Muktah pratijnanat** IV.4.2 (535)

(The self whose true nature has manifested itself is) released;
according to the promise (made by scripture).

**Muktah:** the liberated one, released, freed; **Pratijnanat:** according to
the promise.

The pre vi ous Su tra is fur ther elu ci dated.
Eman ci pa tion is a ces sa tion of all bond age and not the ac ces -
sion of some thing new, just as health is merely the re moval of ill ness
and not a new ac qui si tion.
If re lease is noth ing new that is ac quired by the in di vid ual soul,
then what is its dif fer ence from bond age? The Jiva was stained in the
state of bond age by the three states, i.e., the state of wak ing, dream -

9-11, “It is blind” “It weeps as it were” “It goes to ut ter an ni hi la tion”. It
imag ines it self to be fi nite. It iden ti fies it self with the il lu sory ve hi cles or
Upadhis and ex pe ri ences plea sure, pain, joy and sor row. Af ter
Self-reali sa tion it real ises its true na ture which is ab so lute bliss. It is
freed from all er ro ne ous no tions and mis con cep tions. It is freed from
Avidya or ig no rance and its ef fects. It is per fect, free, in de pend ent.
This is the dif fer ence.
An ni hi la tion of ig no rance is sal va tion. Erad i ca tion of all er ro ne -
ous no tions or mis con cep tions is lib er a tion. De struc tion of the veil of
ig no rance, that sep a rates the in di vid ual soul from the Su preme Soul,
is eman ci pa tion or the fi nal be at i tude.
But how is it known that in its pres ent con di tion the soul is re -
leased? On ac count of the prom ise made in the scrip tures, says the
Su tra.
The Chhandogya Upanishad says, “I will ex plain It to you fur -
ther” (Chh. Up. VIII.9.3; VIII.10.4; VIII.11.3). Here the Sruti pro poses
to ex pound that Self which is free from all im per fec tions. It be gins
thus, “The Self which is free from sin” (Chh. Up. VIII.7.1). “It be ing
with out the body, is not touched by plea sure and pain” (Chh. Up.
VIII.12.1), and con cludes “By his own na ture he man i fests him self.
That is the high est per son. The se rene be ing rises above its body,
reaches the high est light and ap pears in its own true na ture” (Chh.
Up. VIII.12.3).

(The light into which the individual soul enters is) the Supreme
Self; owing to the subject matter of the chapter.

**Atma:** the Supreme Self; **Prakaranat:** on account of the subject
matter of the discourse or context.

This Su tra says that the in di vid ual soul re cov ers his own Self
(the Su preme Self) as stated in Su tra 1.
The Purvapakshin holds: How can the soul be called “lib er ated”
con sid er ing that the clause “(hav ing en tered into) the high est light”
speaks of it as within the sphere of what is a mere ef fect? Be cause
the word ‘light’ in com mon par lance de notes phys i cal light. No one
who has not tran scended be yond the sphere of ef fects can be lib er -
ated, as what ever is an ef fect is tainted with evil.
We re ply: this ob jec tion is with out force. It can not stand; for in
the pas sage re ferred to in the Chh. Up. VIII.3.4 the word ‘light’ de -
notes the Self Su preme, in ac cor dance with the sub ject mat ter of the
Chap ter and not any phys i cal light.

We, there fore, may not all at once pass over to phys i cal light in -
cur ring thereby the fault of aban don ing the topic un der dis cus sion

and in tro duc ing a new one.
The word ‘light’ is also used to de note the Self in the texts like
“The gods med i tate on the im mor tal Light of all lights as lon gev ity”
(Bri. Up. IV.4.16). We have dis cussed this in de tail un der I.3.40.

**Avibhagena:** as inseparable; **Drishtatvat:** for it is so seen from the
scriptures.

A doubt arises whether the in di vid ual soul in the state of eman ci -
pa tion ex ists as dif fer ent from Brah man or as one with and in sep a ra -

The pres ent Su tra de clares that it ex ists as in sep a ra ble from
Brah man, be cause the Sruti texts de clare so. “Thou art That, _Tat_

_Tvam Asi_ ” (Chh. Up. VI.8.7). “ _Aham Brahma Asmi_ , I am Brah man”
(Bri. Up. I.4.10). “Where he sees noth ing else” (Chh. Up. VII.24.1).
“Be ing but Brah man, he is merged in Brah man” (Bri. Up. IV.4.6). All

these Sruti pas sages de clare that the eman ci pated soul is iden ti cal
with Brah man.
Such pas sages as “Just as pure wa ter poured into pure wa ter

re mains the same, thus O Gautama, is the self of a thinker who

the re leased soul, de clare that there is non-sep a ra tion only. The

(The released soul exists) as possessed of (the attributes of)

etc.

**Brahmena:** as possessed of the attributes of Brahman; **Jaiminih:**
Jaimini (holds); **Upanyasadibhyah:** on account of the reference etc.

The view of the sage Jaimini is stated in this con nec tion.
It has been stated that the re leased soul at tains Brah man. Brah -
man has two as pects, viz., one the un con di tioned as pect as pure con -
scious ness and the other as de scribed in the Chhandogya
Upanishad VIII.7.1: “The At man which is free from evil, undecaying,
un dy ing, free from sor row, hun ger and thirst, with true de sires
(Satyakama) and true vo li tions (Satyasankalpa).”
A doubt arises now, which as pect does the re leased soul at tain?
Jaimini main tains that the lib er ated soul at tains the con di tioned as -
pect. Why? Be cause this is known from ref er ence to the na ture of the
self as be ing such in the text cited. The qual i ties of Om ni science and
Om nip o tence are men tioned. Hence Jaimini opines that the re leased
soul at tains the con di tioned as pect of Brah man.

**Chititanmatrena:** solely as pure consciousness ( **Tanmatrena:**
solely); **Tadatmakatvat:** that being its true nature or essence; **Iti:**
thus, so; **Audulomih:** Audulomi (thinks).

The view of sage Audulomi is stated in this con nec tion.
This Su tra gives an other view about the state of eman ci pa tion.
This is the view of the sage Audulomi. Audulomi says that it is the
reali sa tion of the soul’s es sen tial na ture as pure Chaitanya (knowl -
edge, con scious ness or in tel li gence). The soul is solely of the na ture
of Pure Con scious ness. It ex ists as such in the state of re lease.
This con clu sion will also agree with other scrip tural texts such
as Bri. Up. IV.5.13: “Thus this Self has nei ther in side nor out side, but
is al to gether a mass of knowl edge”.
Al though the text enu mer ates dif fer ent qual i ties such as free -
dom from sin, etc., these qual i ties rest only on fan ci ful con cep tions
due to dif fer ence of words; be cause what the text in ti mates is only ab -

Thus also, on account of the existence of the former qualities
admitted owing to reference and so on, there is no
contradiction (between the two); (so thinks) Baadarayana.

**Evam:** thus; **Api:** even; **Upanyasat:** on account of reference;
**Purvabhavat:** owing to attribution of properties mentioned before;
**Avirodham:** there is no contradiction; **Baadarayanah:** Baadarayana
(thinks).

The au thor’s own view is now stated.
Baadarayana rec on ciles both and says that the af fir ma tion of
the di vine at trib utes of Om ni science and Om nip o tence is from the
point of view of God’s na ture when the soul is bound, while the af fir -
ma tion of the soul’s na ture as pure knowl edge is from the point of
view of its re leased state.

Al though it is ad mit ted that in tel li gence con sti tutes the true na -
ture of the Self, also the for mer na ture, i.e., lordly power like that of
Brah man, which is in ti mated by ref er ence and the rest is with a view

**Sankalpat:** by the exercise of will; **Eva:** only; **Tu:** but; **Tat-sruteh:**
because Sruti says so.

The pow ers and priv i leges which a lib er ated soul ac quires are

In the med i ta tion on Brah man within the heart we read as fol -
lows: “If he de sires the world of the fa thers (Pitriloka) by his mere will
they come to him” (Chh. Up. VIII.2.1).
A doubt here arises whether the will alone is the cause to get the
re sult, or the will com bined with some other op er a tive cause.
The Purvapakshin holds that al though scrip ture says “by his
mere will” some other cause must be sup posed to co op er ate as in or -
di nary life. Be cause, as in or di nary ex pe ri ence the meet ing with one’s
fa ther is caused by one’s will, and in ad di tion by the act of go ing and
so on, so it will be with the case of the lib er ated soul also.
This Su tra says that by mere will the re sult co mes, be cause the
Sruti so de clares. If any other cause were re quired, the di rect scrip -
tural state ments “by his will only” would thereby be con tra dicted.

The teacher Baadari says that he does not, be cause the scrip -

sires and re joices” (Chh. Up. VIII.12.5). This clearly in di cates that he

because the scripture declares (the capacity to assume) divine forms.
( **Vikalpa:** option, diversity in manifestation; **Amananat:** from

A con trary view to Su tra 10 is ad duced.
The teacher Jaimini is of the opin ion that the lib er ated soul pos -
sesses a body and or gans as well as a mind. the Chhandogya
Upanishad de clares “He be ing one be comes three, five, seven, nine”

therefore, from this, from this very reason.

A de ci sion is given on the con flict ing views noted above.
Baadarayana af firms from the two fold dec la ra tions of the two

**Pradipavat:** like the flame of a lamp; **Avesah:** entering, animating;
**Tatha:** thus, so; **Hi:** because; **Darsayati:** the scripture shows (or

This Su tra shows the pos si bil ity of the lib er ated soul of si mul ta -
neously pos sess ing sev eral bod ies other than his own.
In Su tra 11 it has been shown that a re leased soul can as sume
many bod ies at the same time for en joy ment.
A doubt arises whether the bod ies which the re leased cre ate for
them selves when ren der ing them selves three fold and so on are soul -
less like wooden fig ures or an i mated by souls like the bod ies of men.
The Purvapakshin main tains that as nei ther the soul nor the
mind can be di vided, they are joined with one body only, while other
bod ies are soul less. Other bod ies are life less pup pets. En joy ment is
pos si ble only in that body in which the soul and mind ex ist.
This Su tra re futes this view and says, “Like the flame of a lamp
in their en ter ing” i.e., just as the one flame of a lamp can en ter into dif -
fer ent wicks lighted from it, the re leased soul, al though one only, mul -
ti plies it self through its lordly power and en ters into all these bod ies. It
cre ates bod ies with in ter nal or gans cor re spond ing to the orig i nal in -

way one may be come many. “He is onefold, he is three fold, five fold,

(The declaration of absence of all cognition is made) having in

**Svapyayasampattyoh:** of deep sleep and absolute union (with

**Avishkritam:** this is made clear (by the Sruti); **Hi:** because.
( **Svapyaya:** deep sleep; **Anyatara:** either, any of the two;
**Apeksham:** with reference to, with regard to.)

The range of knowl edge of the lib er ated soul is now dis cussed.
The Purvapakshin holds: How can lordly power, en abling the re -
leased soul to en ter into sev eral bod ies and en joy be ad mit ted if we
con sider the dif fer ent scrip tural texts which de clare that the soul in
that state has not any spe cific cog ni tion? e.g., “What should one know
and through what?” (Bri. Up. II.4.14). “But there is not the sec ond
thing sep a rate from it which it can know” (Bri. Up. IV.3.30). “It be -
comes like wa ter, one, wit ness and with out a sec ond” (Bri. Up.
IV.3.32).
This Su tra says that these texts re fer ei ther to the state of deep
sleep or to that of fi nal re lease in which the soul at tains ab so lute un ion
with the Nirguna Brah man.
Those pas sages on the other hand, which de scribe lordly power
re fer to an al to gether dif fer ent con di tion which like the heav enly
world, is an abode where knowl edge of Saguna Brah man pro duces
its re sults.
We have been dis cuss ing in the pre vi ous Sutras about one who
has not at tained ab so lute un ion with Nirguna Brah man but only
Brahmaloka. There is cog ni tion in Brahmaloka. There is en joy ment
also in heaven. The dif fer ence be tween heaven and Brahmaloka is
that one does not re turn to this world from Brahmaloka whereas one
re turns to this uni verse from heaven when the re sults of his vir tu ous

The lim i ta tions of the re leased souls’ power are stated here.
A doubt here pres ents it self whether those who through med i ta -
tion on the Saguna Brah man en ter Brahmaloka pos sess un lim ited
lordly power or power lim ited to some ex tent.
The Purvapakshin main tains that their pow ers must be un lim -
ited, be cause we meet with texts such as “They can roam at will in all
the worlds” (Chh. Up. VII.25.2; VIII.1.6). “He ob tains self-lord ship”
(Tait. Sam. I.6.2). “To him all the gods of fer wor ship” (Tait. Sam. I.5.3).
“For him there is free dom in all worlds” (Chh. Up. VIII.1.6).
This Su tra says that the lib er ated souls at tain all lordly pow ers
such as Anima, ren der ing one self to atomic size, etc., ex cept the
power of cre ation, etc. Cre ation, pres er va tion and de struc tion, on the
other hand can be long to the ev er last ingly per fect Lord only. Why so?
Be cause the Lord is the sub ject mat ter of all the texts deal ing with cre -
ation, etc., while the re leased souls are not men tioned at all in this
con nec tion.
Fur ther, this would lead to many Isvaras. If they have the power
of cre ation of the uni verse they may not be of one mind. There may be
con flict of wills with re spect to cre ation, etc. One may de sire to cre ate,
and an other to de stroy. Such con flicts can only be avoided by as sum -
ing that the wishes of one should con form to those of an other and
from this it fol lows that all other souls de pend on the High est Lord.
Hence the pow ers of the re leased souls are not ab so lute but
lim ited and are de pend ent on the will of the Lord.

“ _Nadhikarikamandalasthokteh_ ”.
“He be comes the Lord of him self— _Apnoti svarajyam_ ” (Tait. Up.

that the lim ited soul at tains ab so lute pow ers.
This pres ent Su tra re futes this and says that his pow ers de pend
on the Lord, be cause the text cited fur ther on says, “He at tains the
Lord of the mind, the Lord who dwells in spheres like the sun, etc.,
and en trusts the sun, etc., with of fices.”
There fore, it is quite clear from this lat ter part of the text that the
lib er ated soul ob tains its pow ers from the Lord and de pends on Him.
Hence its pow ers are not un lim ited. He at tains pow ers as the gift of
the Su preme Lord who is in the sun, etc., and who be stows the func -

of transformation by birth, decay, death, etc.; **Cha:** and; **Tatha:** so; **Hi:**
because; **Sthitim:** status, condition, existence; **Aha:** (Sruti) declares.

The de scrip tion of the sta tus of the lib er ated soul is con tin ued.
Ac cord ing to scrip ture, there is also an in ter nal form of the Su -
preme Lord, which does not abide in ef fects. He is not only the rul ing
soul of the spheres of the sun and so on which lie within the sphere of
what is ef fected.
The text de clares this abid ing in a two-fold form as fol lows:
“Such is the great ness of it; greater than that is the Purusha; one foot
of Him is all be ings; His other three feet are what is im mor tal in
heaven” (Chh. Up. III.12.6).
This text in ti mates that the High est Lord abides in two forms, the
tran scen den tal and the rel a tive.
He who med i tates on the Lord in His rel a tive as pect does not at -
tain the tran scen den tal as pect. He who wor ships the Lord as hav ing
form can not at tain the form less Brah man, be cause of the law of pro -
por tion of fruit to de sire. The Sruti de clares “As one med i tates upon
That, so he be comes.”
As the meditator on the rel a tive as pects of the Lord is un able to
com pre hend it fully, he at tains only lim ited pow ers and not un lim ited
pow ers like the Lord Him self.

**Darsayataschaivam pratyakshanumane** IV.4.20 (553)

And thus perception and inference show.

**Darsayatah:** they both show; **Cha:** and; **Evam:** thus;
**Pratyaksha-anumane:** Pratyaksha and Anumana, perception and
inference.

This Su tra de clares that the tran scen den tal as pect of the Lord is
es tab lished by both the Sruti and Smriti. Sruti and Smriti both de clare
that the high est light does not abide within ef fected thing, “The sun
does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor these lightnings
and much less this fire” (Mun. Up. II.2.10). “The sun does not il lu mine
it, nor the moon, nor fire” (Bhagavad Gita, XV.6).

**^moJ_mÌgmå`{b“mƒŸ&**

**Bhogamatrasamyalingaccha** IV.4.21 (554)

And because of the indications (in the scriptures) of equality (of
the liberated soul with the Lord) only with respect to
enjoyment.

**Bhogamatra:** with respect to enjoyment only; **Samya:** equality;
**Lingat:** from the indication of Sruti; **Cha:** also, and.

That the pow ers of the lib er ated soul are not un lim ited is also
known from the in di ca tion in the Sruti that the equal ity of these souls
with the Lord is only with re gard to en joy ment and not with re spect to
cre ation, etc.
“As all be ings hon our that De ity, so do all be ings hon our him
who knows that” (Bri. Up. I.5.20). “Through it he at tains iden tity with
the De ity, or lives in the same world with it” (Bri. Up. I.5.23).
All these texts de scribe equal ity only with re gard to en joy ment.
They do not men tion any thing with ref er ence to cre ation, etc.

**AZmd¥{Îm... eãXmXZmd¥{Îm... eãXmV²Ÿ&**

**Anavrittih sabdadanavrittih sabdat** IV.4.22 (555)

(There is) no return (for these liberated souls), on account of
the scriptural statement (to that effect).

**Anavrittih:** no return; **Sabdat:** on account of the scriptural statement.

The dis cus sion on the priv i leges of the lib er ated soul is con -
cluded here.
The Purvapakshin main tains: If the pow ers of the lib er ated souls
are lim ited, then they too will come to an end like all lim ited mor tal be -
ings. There fore, the lib er ated souls will have to re turn to this world
from Brahmaloka.
This Su tra re futes this and says that those who go to
Brahmaloka by the path of the gods do not re turn from there. Be cause

```
BRAHMA SUTRAS 536
```

scrip tural pas sages teach that they do not so re turn. “Go ing up by that
way, one reaches im mor tal ity” (Chh. Up. VIII.6.6). “Those who pro -
ceed on that path do not re turn to the life of man” (Chh. Up. IV.15.6).
“He reaches the world of Brah man and does not re turn” (Chh. Up.
VII.15.1). “They no more re turn to this world” (Bri. Up. VI.2.15).
The rep e ti tion of the words “No re turn”, etc., in di cates that the
book is fin ished.

Thus ends the Fourth Pada (Sec tion 4) of the Fourth Chap ter
(Adhyaya IV) of the Brahma Sutras or the Vedanta Phi los o phy
of Sri Baadarayana or Sri Veda-Vyasa or
